He has no respect for women, he has no filter, he's ungrateful, and he's cruel. He's not kind in any way shape for fashion, and he acts like he can waltz around doing whatever he’d like.
2. Emenim. This ‘GOAT’ rapper has to have problems with everyone. He picks a fight with everyone for no reason. He dragged the rapper NF for saying that he was one of his favorite rappers. If that's not uncalled for and ungrateful I don't know what is.
3. Ludacris. His lyrics…. He’s not a horrible person, but it’s not like he’s a kind or generous one either. I could give specific reasons, but I’m not in the mood to dump dirt.

Generally, she’s sweet and bubbly, but there’s always that occasion when she makes a mistake, and here is Ari’s flaw; She never apologizes. I believe that anyone should be forgiven if they apologize sincerely for a mistake. Ariana isn’t known to do this.
2. Justin Bieber. I used to hate Justin Bieber a lot more than I do now, But it was all because of mistakes he made in his past. Yeah, he was a screwed-up kid... He hit people and was rude, and had mean things to say about everybody, and was ungrateful. But as time has gone on, he's grown up and matured, and is now a reasonably decent person.
3. Taylor Swift. I’m surprised I’m putting her on here too. She’s generally very generous and kind towards her fans and people in general, but she’s very defensive. When she was being blocked from performing her music at the AMAS, (VERY uncool,) She turned to her fans to drag Big Machines, which also isn’t cool. So she’s a little defensive, but she’s not a terrible person really. I mean, I love her and her music, but sometimes I totally see her hard side.

Contrary to popular stereotypes, historians are generally a cautious bunch. We assess the past from widely divergent points of view and are deeply concerned about being viewed as fair and accurate by our colleagues. When we make historical judgments, we are acting not as voters or even pundits, but as scholars who must evaluate all the evidence, good, bad or indifferent. Separate surveys, conducted by those perceived as conservatives as well as liberals, show remarkable unanimity about who the best and worst presidents have been. Historians do tend, as a group, to be far more liberal than the citizenry as a whole — a fact the president’s admirers have seized on to dismiss the poll results as transparently biased. One pro-Bush historian said the survey revealed more about “the current crop of history professors” than about Bush or about Bush’s eventual standing. But if historians were simply motivated by a strong collective liberal bias, they might be expected to call Bush the worst president since his father, or Ronald Reagan, or Nixon. Instead, more than half of those polled — and nearly three-fourths of those who gave Bush a negative rating — reached back before Nixon to find a president they considered as miserable as Bush. The presidents most commonly linked with Bush included Hoover, Andrew Johnson and Buchanan. Twelve percent of the historians polled — nearly as many as those who rated Bush a success — flatly called Bush the worst president in American history, And these figures were gathered before the debacles over Hurricane Katrina, Bush’s role in the Valerie Plame leak affair and the deterioration of the situation in Iraq. Were the historians polled today, that figure would certainly be higher. Even worse for the president, the general public, having once given Bush the highest approval ratings ever recorded, now appears to be coming around to the dismal view held by most historians. To be sure, the president retains a considerable base of supporters who believe in and adore him, and who reject all criticism with a mixture of disbelief and fierce contempt — about one-third of the electorate. (When the columnist Richard Reeves publicized the historians’ poll last year and suggested it might have merit, he drew thousands of abusive replies that called him an idiot and that praised Bush as, in one writer’s words, “a Christian who actually acts on his deeply held beliefs.”) Yet the ranks of the true believers have thinned dramatically. A majority of voters in forty-three states now disapprove of Bush’s handling of his job. Since the commencement of reliable polling in the 1940s, only one twice-elected president has seen his ratings fall as low as Bush’s in his second term: Richard Nixon, during the months preceding his resignation in 1974. No two-term president since polling began has fallen from such a height of popularity as Bush’s (in the neighborhood of ninety percent, during the patriotic upswell following the 2001 attacks) to such a low (now in the midthirties). No president, including Harry Truman (whose ratings sometimes dipped below Nixonian levels), has experienced such a virtually unrelieved decline as Bush has since his high point. Apart from sharp but temporary upticks that followed the commencement of the Iraq war and the capture of Saddam Hussein, and a recovery during the weeks just before and after his re-election, the Bush trend has been a profile in fairly steady disillusionment.",0

These were the men who guided the nation through what historians consider its greatest crises: the founding era after the ratification of the Constitution, the Civil War, and the Great Depression and Second World War.

Bush, however, is one of the rarities in presidential history: He has not only stumbled badly in every one of these key areas, he has also displayed a weakness common among the greatest presidential failures — an unswerving adherence to a simplistic ideology that abjures deviation from dogma as heresy, thus preventing any pragmatic adjustment to changing realities.

It took more than two years for Johnson’s disapproval rating in the Gallup Poll to reach fifty-two percent in March 1968 — a figure Bush long ago surpassed, but that was sufficient to persuade the proud LBJ not to seek re-election. Yet recently, just short of three years after Bush buoyantly declared “mission accomplished” in Iraq, his disapproval ratings have been running considerably higher than Johnson’s, at about sixty percent.

But Bush’s publicly expressed view that he has made no major mistakes, coupled with what even the conservative commentator William F. Buckley Jr. calls his “high-flown pronouncements” about failed policies, seems to foreclose the first option. Upping the ante in the Middle East and bombing Iranian nuclear sites, a strategy reportedly favored by some in the White House, could distract the public and gain Bush immediate political capital in advance of the 2006 midterm elections — but in the long term might severely worsen the already dire situation in Iraq, especially among Shiite Muslims linked to the Iranians. And given Bush’s ardent attachment to loyal aides, no matter how discredited, a major personnel shake-up is improbable, short of indictments. Replacing Andrew Card with Joshua Bolten as chief of staff — a move announced by the president in March in a tone that sounded more like defiance than contrition — represents a rededication to current policies and personnel, not a serious change. (Card, an old Bush family retainer, was widely considered more moderate than most of the men around the president and had little involvement in policy-making.)

Instead of emphasizing any political, diplomatic or humanitarian aspects of a war on Iraq-an appeal that would have sounded too “sensitive,” as Cheney once sneered — the administration built a “Bush Doctrine” of unprovoked, preventive — warfare, based on speculative threats and embracing principles previously abjured by every previous generation of U.S. foreign policy-makers, even at the height of the Cold War. The president did so with premises founded, in the case of Iraq, on wishful thinking. He did so while proclaiming an expansive Wilsonian rhetoric of making the world safe for democracy — yet discarding the multilateralism and systems of international law (including the Geneva Conventions) that emanated from Wilson’s idealism. He did so while dismissing intelligence that an American invasion could spark a long and bloody civil war among Iraq’s fierce religious and ethnic rivals, reports that have since proved true.

While wiping out the solid Clinton-era federal surplus and raising federal deficits to staggering record levels, Bush’s tax policies have necessitated hikes in federal fees, state and local taxes, and co-payment charges to needy veterans and families who rely on Medicaid, along with cuts in loan programs to small businesses and college students, and in a wide range of state services. The lion’s share of benefits from the tax cuts has gone to the very richest Americans, while new business investment has increased at a historically sluggish rate since the peak of the last business cycle five years ago. Private-sector job growth since 2001 has been anemic compared to the Bush administration’s original forecasts and is chiefly attributable not to the tax cuts but to increased federal spending, especially on defense.

Richard Nixon’s conduct of the war in Southeast Asia and his covert domestic-surveillance programs prompted Congress to pass new statutes regulating executive power.",0

Armed with legal findings by his attorney general (and personal lawyer) Alberto Gonzales, the Bush White House has declared that the president’s powers as commander in chief in wartime are limitless. No previous wartime president has come close to making so grandiose a claim. More specifically, this administration has asserted that the president is perfectly free to violate federal laws on such matters as domestic surveillance and the torture of detainees. When Congress has passed legislation to limit those assertions, Bush has resorted to issuing constitutionally dubious “signing statements,” which declare, by fiat, how he will interpret and execute the law in question, even when that interpretation flagrantly violates the will of Congress. Earlier presidents, including Jackson, raised hackles by offering their own view of the Constitution in order to justify vetoing congressional acts. Bush doesn’t bother with that: He signs the legislation (eliminating any risk that Congress will overturn a veto), and then governs how he pleases — using the signing statements as if they were line-item vetoes. In those instances when Bush’s violations of federal law have come to light, as over domestic surveillance, the White House has devised a novel solution: Stonewall any investigation into the violations and bid a compliant Congress simply to rewrite the laws.",0

One need go back in the record less than a decade to find prominent Republicans railing against far more minor presidential legal infractions as precursors to all-out totalitarianism. “I will have no part in the creation of a constitutional double-standard to benefit the president,” Sen. Bill Frist declared of Bill Clinton’s efforts to conceal an illicit sexual liaison. “No man is above the law, and no man is below the law — that’s the principle that we all hold very dear in this country,” Rep. Tom DeLay asserted. “The rule of law protects you and it protects me from the midnight fire on our roof or the 3 A.M. knock on our door,” warned Rep. Henry Hyde, one of Clinton’s chief accusers. In the face of Bush’s more definitive dismissal of federal law, the silence from these quarters is deafening.",0

And as Lincoln showed during the Civil War, there may be times of military emergency where the executive believes it imperative to take immediate, highly irregular, even unconstitutional steps. “I felt that measures, otherwise unconstitutional, might become lawful,” Lincoln wrote in 1864, “by becoming indispensable to the preservation of the Constitution, through the preservation of the nation.” Bush seems to think that, since 9/11, he has been placed, by the grace of God, in the same kind of situation Lincoln faced. But Lincoln, under pressure of daily combat on American soil against fellow Americans, did not operate in secret, as Bush has. He did not claim, as Bush has, that his emergency actions were wholly regular and constitutional as well as necessary; Lincoln sought and received Congressional authorization for his suspension of habeas corpus in 1863. Nor did Lincoln act under the amorphous cover of a “war on terror” — a war against a tactic, not a specific nation or political entity, which could last as long as any president deems the tactic a threat to national security. Lincoln’s exceptional measures were intended to survive only as long as the Confederacy was in rebellion. Bush’s could be extended indefinitely, as the president sees fit, permanently endangering rights and liberties guaranteed by the Constitution to the citizenry.",0

He has had two enormous opportunities to fulfill those pledges: first, in the noisy aftermath of his controversial election in 2000, and, even more, after the attacks of September nth, when the nation pulled behind him as it has supported no other president in living memory. Yet under both sets of historically unprecedented circumstances, Bush has chosen to act in ways that have left the country less united and more divided, less conciliatory and more acrimonious — much like James Buchanan, Andrew Johnson and Herbert Hoover before him. And, like those three predecessors, Bush has done so in the service of a rigid ideology that permits no deviation and refuses to adjust to changing realities. Buchanan failed the test of Southern secession, Johnson failed in the face of Reconstruction, and Hoover failed in the face of the Great Depression. Bush has failed to confront his own failures in both domestic and international affairs, above all in his ill-conceived responses to radical Islamic terrorism. Having confused steely resolve with what Ralph Waldo Emerson called “a foolish consistency . . . adored by little statesmen,” Bush has become entangled in tragedies of his own making, compounding those visited upon the country by outside forces.",0

There have been presidents — Harry Truman was one — who have left office in seeming disgrace, only to rebound in the estimates of later scholars. But so far the facts are not shapingup propitiously for George W. Bush. He still does his best to deny it. Having waved away the lessons of history in the making of his decisions, the present-minded Bush doesn’t seem to be concerned about his place in history. “History.

 * After immediately erasing the surplus, he went right straight to work creating a deficit by enacting tax cuts for the rich. At that point, the economy was in peril because he borrowed the money to pay for the deficit
 * From there, he allowed Wall Street and the Banking Industry to conduct the greatest economic fraud the world had ever seen, specifically, the Real Estate Mortgage bubble
 * Then the Twin Towers were bombed thanks to the inaction of his administration even though they had ample warning of impending attacks
 * So he started a war to “punish” the “terrorists”. He did not raise taxes to pay for his war. This increased the deficit, and required more borrowing, but he hid this reality from the public
 * His poll numbers began dropping like a rock because the economy was in trouble, and his war seemed to be an exercise in futility. So he lied to the public, blaming Iraq for 911, convincing many that Saddam Hussein was going to attack us with nuclear weapons, and that such an attack was imminent. This led to yet another war, and more deficit spending, resulting in even more increases in the national debt. He continued pretending that none of these ruinous decisions were negatively affecting the national debt.
 * In order to make the public think that he was a “leader” keeping us “safe” from our many enemies, he institutionalized the torture of prisoners taken in these unjust wars. The torture was carried out in the name of the US citizens, We all share the guilt for his lust for war.
 * The economy finally collapsed thanks to the massive national debt, and the collapse of the Mortgage Industry brought on by his economic fraud, and of course, his wealthy cronies who were benefiting exponentially by both his wars and his economic policies, slapped the bill for the economic collapse, on us, the decent citizens of the country.
 * The economic collapse wiped out the dreams of millions of American Workers whose entire retirement was tied up in 401k’s and IRAs that became worthless overnight. They had to cash out to survive because their jobs were eradicate when the economy collapsed. Many more millions of Americans lost their homes at the same time, as houses they had bought also lost most of their value leaving them in unmanageable debt.
 * And through it all, Bush refused to raise taxes, which made the effects of all of this even worse on those who were not wealthy to begin with.

In the case of the Canadian, they forced a passenger airliner down, took the unsuspecting man off by force and took him to Syria and Greece to be tortured for months until they realized they had the wrong man. This happened frequently it turns out. How do you say sorry to a man you've mistakenly tortured? Well, in Bush's case, most were released, during winter, into combat areas in Afghanistan, wearing only their underwear and with no passports or money, in the hope they would be killed. The worst thing about this was Bush and Cheney denying vehemently that the USA didn't torture people, and that waterboarding wasn't torture (and yet we shot Japanese soldiers for doing it to Americans after WW2). If it was such a great thing, then why didn't they announce it to the world, scream it loud and proud from the rooftops -- if we capture you, we'll use ""harsh interrogation"" techniques?

Probably the worst things the Bush Administration ever did, and it destroyed the image of the USA as a beacon of Hope. Where in the past the US biggest export was Hope, now it was Fear, and it raised legions of ""terrorists"" for the enemy. In Greece, our Ambassador quit rather than be part of a State Dept. whose unofficial motto under the Bush Administration was the same as Caligula's: ""Let them hate so long as they fear.""",0

Of course, these people, staunch Republicans all, serve at the pleasure of the Administration. They also were all either investigating  K Street abuses, that lead to the downfall of Jack Abramoff and Duke Cunningham (biggest bribe scandal in US history), or they refused to indict Democrats without reason just before the 2006 election, simply to discredit the Democratic Party as a time when Ted Stevens, Larry Craig and many other Republicans were being routinely arrested for serious or sexual crimes. The LA AG was replaced by a loyal crony who destroyed all the investigative materials that put Cunningham away and probably would have implicated Issa and Lewis and at least 4 other Republican Congressmen. In Louisiana, the AG was replaced by a friend of Karl Rove who wasn't even a lawyer but was a loyal party member. The mistake was that Bush's team tried to justify the firings which opened the door to investigations showing rampant abuse of power and cover ups. Because Bush was a lame duck and the Democrats took over in 2006 there was no follow up on the scandal when there should have been hearings and investigations.

This, coupled with failed military oversight throughout the campaigns into Iraq (leading to countless human rights violations) and Congress’ failure to exercise its right as the judicial branch of the federal government, was really the first monumental step in allowing the Republican Party to fracture itself.

These values were: fiscal responsibility, national defense, and smaller government.

The war in the Middle East was unpopular, so the GOP could not run on national defense. The Department of Homeland Security is the largest government agency ever constructed, as such, the GOP could not run on smaller government. When Republicans could no longer form policy and run campaigns on these basic values they became an organization of social policies (pro life, anti gay marriage, anti voting rights, anti flag burning) and Anti Democrats.

She managed to stay relevant by changing completely her style every time she released an album she was a completely different woman in every single way, her outfits, her hair style, her music, her songs.She evolved, didn’t remain static. While others indulge to drugs and alcohol, like Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey, she found an outlet to sports and yoga.I think her self confidence is that makes her so special though, she may lack everything else. She is very self confident and works very hard. I think of her more of as a business woman rather than an artist. As she herself said when asked about her height ‘’everything about me is average’’.She must have had a bad reaction to some medicine as she actually told the truth. Madonna is mediocre at everything she does, to say the least, but she has built her career on manic ambition, courage and physical strength. Her most successful imitator Lady Gaga is musically far superior.",0

She’s had 38 top 10 singles in the U.S. alone, more than even Elvis or The Beetles. Of those 38, 12 are #1’s. She’s also is the best selling solo artist of all time. Just because radio doesn’t play her music anymore (ageism) her new music is still very good. Check out the video for her most recently released single with Maluma called Medellin. This single is so breezy and catchy and people call it the song of the Summer. Recent singles (like Ghosttown) would’ve been huge hits if radio would still play her. But they don’t. That happens to every artist. When was the last time Paul McCartney was on the Hot 100 as a solo artist? He still makes great music though, too. Even without radio or MTV videos, Madonna is being discovered by a new generation. There are a lot of YouTubers making reaction videos to both Madonna videos and albums. The reactions are out of control praising her. Check out some of the reactions from LANDMAN on YouTube. Her videos and concert clips always blow his mind, and he’s a straight millennial.

I was shooting a very intense scene, closed set obviously. Anyway who suddenly walks in..Madonna! Firstly, in real life she doesn’t look anything like she does in magazines.

She makes only females go back to the hair and makeup room, and not just make sure we stay there, but she makes them, her team, lock us in! There wasn’t even a toilet in there.

On Friday nights we used to like to go to the gym to destress after the working week. As we got to the reception my wife whispers to me ‘Hey that’s Lourdes, Madonna’s daughter’. Now I had had a rough week and not being a big fan I kind of shrugged an acknowledgement and grabbed our coats and headed to the locker room to put them away. I walked onto the gym floor toward my wife who was on one of the exercise bikes and as I pass by she says to me ‘Can you get me some water?’ so I turn around and say ‘Honey you just sat down, how about you grab yourself some water’. At the same time as she’s saying this she is doing this strange repeated sideways nod with her head so I say ‘ Honey are you feeling alright?’ and then I look left and there’s Madonna on the next bike. Anyway unconsciously I mouth the words ‘Ah….Madonna’ and I crack an awkward smile and slink off to the mats to do some stretching with Madonna eyeballing me the whole time. A minute or two later from across the room I see my wife and Madonna engaging in a conversation and laughing, so at the end of the workout I ask my wife what they talked about and she goes ‘Madonna said ‘I hope he’s good in bed because he’s not very clever….’",0

It was a small get together for some friends in a bar in New York around 2005. I went to the bar to get a drink and when I returned to my friends guess who was standing directly behind me? Madonna! And she remained arms distance away for about 30 minutes as she spoke with her friends. (She is tiny, happy and was smiling/ laughing a lot). At this point Madonna and group proceeded to the dance floor and she disappeared from my sight. I grabbed a drink and also went to dance with my friends, though Madonna was nowhere to be seen. After an hour had passed she reappeared - directly in front of me as she was saying good bye to someone in my group. This was my chance haha - I said, “Madonna I love you”. She just stood there smiling, so I said “No really, I love you”. To my shock, she then came right up and kissed me. No words exchanged. Just a simple kiss. I have heard she can be cold and unfriendly, however my experience shows that she can be the exact opposite. Her human side was shown. And she could sense my genuine adoration. (I am not one of those “crazy” fans). I don’t feel she would have done this under “normal” circumstances from a fan in day to day life, but instead felt comfortable doing it due to the intimate nature of the party we were both attending for a mutual friend.",0

It would seem that to be a self-respecting American progressive, you must adopt the affectations of cultural self-hate. According to many ""liberal"" academics, the United States is to blame for nearly every conceivable global ill that has ever taken place. Sectarian violence has just erupted in an African country. Ah, this is a delayed response to European colonialism, which the United States tacitly supported via its non-intervention. The reign of terror unleashed by Islamists around the globe is of course driven by the United States' ""warped"" foreign policy. The sadistic regime of Saddam Hussein is the creation of the United States, as ""we supported Saddam in his war against the Iranians."" Many of the older American academics with Marxist leanings have never been able to digest the genocides that were afflicted by Joseph Stalin and Mao Tse-Tung on their respective peoples: ""Hey, a dictator has to find some way to relax no? The real evildoers though are the American capitalist pigs."" The killing fields of the Khmer Rouge were apparently a delayed posttraumatic response to the American bombings that had taken place several years earlier during the Vietnam War. I am not kidding! Some ""progressives"" have even questioned the military involvement of the United States in WWII. Pacifism would certainly have defeated the Allied Axis much more humanely than the brutality of the American military-industrial complex. Nice! The weak-minded and tortuous logic let alone the intellectual dishonesty are hallucinatory.

1444786133712478209,Bush is shitty linebacker who takes the wrong angles every snap Jesus Christ take his ass out #HereWeGo,"Am I suggesting that the United States has never engaged in bad actions? Does the United States consist of perfect beings that have never committed geopolitical transgressions? Of course not. Show me a country that does not doggedly pursue its self-interests and I'll show you pigs that fly. However, I do believe that the United States stands for a set of universal ideals that has illuminated the world. Within the pantheon of moral and altruistic [ https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/altruism ]civilizations, it is difficult to argue against the preeminent position that the United States would hold in any such ranking. One wonders why otherwise the world's populace has always sought to gain entry into the United States. Ah, it must be because the United States plundered the world's natural resources and hence prospective immigrants are ""forced to escape"" their poverty to join the oppressor. Perhaps the millions of immigrants who've desperately sought to come to the United States were experiencing a twisted form of the Stockholm Syndrome!",0

No ""progressive"" academic should ever be caught displaying shameless and ""vulgar"" patriotism.

So to Sean Penn, Michael Moore, Noam Chomsky, Barbara Streisand, Martin Sheen, and the rest of the useful idiots (to borrow Lenin's famous term), there are endless countries that you could emigrate to, as a means of escaping the ""horrors"" of the American experience.

I’ve travelled in Latin America, the Caribbean and lived in Indonesia, Ghana, Qatar, Malaysia, and Ireland, and currently reside in Singapore. Indonesia for example, is a lovely country full of sweet people, (including my in laws) but heir government is rotten top to bottom, and you can’t even get a routine drivers license without paying someone a bribe to simply do their work! Just imagine what it might entail to get any kind of visa or business permission! Any paperwork must always be accompanied by a “gift” or it gets put to the bottom of the pile, if not outright lost! There is no job accountability! Each petty bureaucrat has their own little fiefdom!",0

The pettiest of reasons might be used to deny one an exit visa. If you’re late on a bill, or have credit problems, or if it simply doesn’t please your boss, you’re out of luck! Worse yet, there are many thousands of workers trapped in the gulf states who were tricked on their employment contracts and wind up owing their employers more than they have made for grossly overpriced housing and food rations. They are virtual slaves, “owing their souls to the company store” like the old Tennessee Ernie Ford song “Sixteen Tons” sang about. The government turns a blind eye, while pretending to build a utopian society.",0
1444786133712478209,Bush is shitty linebacker who takes the wrong angles every snap Jesus Christ take his ass out #HereWeGo,"Then there’s Malaysia, where a simple phone call to the governor of the state I was living in from an “old boy network” crony, was all that it took to revoke my work visa. The crony, simply had a problem with my opening a competing business too close to his! I was even accused of criminal behaviour, and there was a police investigation opened, but not pursued. I finally sued them and won, but not before going through a bit of hell with the anxiety of not knowing what my legal and economic footing was going to be. I loved my time there, and made lifelong friends, but I was clear that there were ruling elites with titles who functioned under a different set of rules from the rest of us. The law was unequally enforced, and you were basically at their mercy and had better not put at foot out of place. Due process of law was subordinate to a who knows who and who owes who a favor mentality. Being a foreigner, I was also routinely over charged for things, from house rentals to car leasing by those who were supposed to be helping me get settled. As an American, it’s assumed that I was a walking ATM, and it was fine to take advantage of me. I learned quickly that there isn’t much in the way of consumer protection, and it’s truly “caveat emptor.” You really did have to learn the ropes and the correct price of things, or you’d be wasting money left and right. I found the same thing in Thailand. If you didn’t know your fabrics for instance, you’d be paying for one quality of suit and getting quite another, inferior in quality. My Indonesian wife decided that I should never go to the open market by myself. They always charged me too much, while she was able to get a fair price. Of course in the more modern supermarkets there are prices marked in things so I was safe there.",0
1444786133712478209,Bush is shitty linebacker who takes the wrong angles every snap Jesus Christ take his ass out #HereWeGo,"In Ireland, things were good, and people are friendly, but trying to get customer service for your cable or electricity or any other utility is quite a trial. Between late start times, nobody available on the weekends and two hour lunches, just getting hold of somebody is a major accomplishment. Government websites routinely don’t work properly. leading to “Kafkaesque” catch 22’s where they’ll tell you if you have trouble to call a certain number, but then you can’t get through but the message tells you to go to the website. In addition, lots of things just aren’t available on the shelf in the stores, and they’ll routinely run out of this or that if you don’t live in a big city! Public transportation is tough if you live outside the big metro areas. A couple of years ago, I was returning from New York where I was visiting, and I missed the last bus from Dublin to my town 2 1/2 hrs away. I had to wait in the airport lounge from 11:30 pm till 7:40 am the next day for the next bus. I chose this rather than pay the €200+ for a local hotel.",0
1444786133712478209,Bush is shitty linebacker who takes the wrong angles every snap Jesus Christ take his ass out #HereWeGo,"Work wise, trying to get staff to work weekends or overtime is a bit of a lost cause. Employment contracts are very narrow and specific as to what an employer can and can’t expect from an employee. I’ve never seen a group where less actual work got done in a week, and where a workers rights far exceeded their responsibilities. It takes forever to get things done. It’s a “unionist’s paradise.” This contrasts sharply with the “get it done” “go the extra mile” attitude so common in the US that it’s a bit of a shock. It’s great if you’re an employee but not so much if you’re trying to run a business. Singapore is just the opposite. They’ll work you 24/7 if they can. Work/life balance is definitely skewed towards work in Singapore. I’d call the US a happy medium.",0
1444786133712478209,Bush is shitty linebacker who takes the wrong angles every snap Jesus Christ take his ass out #HereWeGo,"In Ghana and Malaysia its almost impossible to get good service in a restaurant. You’ve got to send out a search party for wait staff if you want a second drink for instance, and the food is like as not to come out wrong, cold, out of order or an item or two is simply forgotten. Often, one of the party will receive their food 20 minutes before their dinner companions entree is ready. I developed the strategy of sharing entrees so that both parties could eat together sequentially sharing dishes. It seldom matters how upscale the establishment is either. I’d say this is less the case in some of the bigger cities in Europe, but it’s endemic practically everywhere else.",0
1444786133712478209,Bush is shitty linebacker who takes the wrong angles every snap Jesus Christ take his ass out #HereWeGo,"So the purpose of this little tirade isn’t to say that nothing bad ever happens in the US, it does, of course. It’s to compare and contrast a bit. Yes, there is corruption in the states, but you won’t find it at the DMV. like Indonesia. It’s reserved for higher ups and government contracts etc. Neither is it to say that nobody in power ever exercises their prerogative unfairly., like in Malaysia. Of course they do, but we have legal redress of grievances available to everyone. There are advocacy groups. I didn’t have that in Malaysia. In addition, there are areas where I feel the US excels: 1. Customer service and going the “extra mile” to get your business. This is so apparent in restaurants in particular. Being a tipping culture is part of this but I find it in department stores as well. People are helpful! Don’t count on that overseas I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been told by a clerk lounging on their cell phone that “we’re out of this or that” so they didn’t have to actually go in the back and look for something. 2. By extension, Americans have a great work ethic. Americans, as a rule, are hard workers and want to do things not just correctly but exceptionally. Perhaps it’s to keep their jobs, but I don’t see that in too many places. Doing just enough to get by is endemic in parts of Asia and Europe. It’s even worse in Spain, Italy, and France than it is in Ireland. 3. Variety of consumer products available. There’s no comparison anywhere else I’ve been. We have EVERYTHING in spades available in the US. 4. General friendliness. From an airport waiting gate to a line at Starbucks, it’s hard not to get into a friendly conversation with a complete stranger. I don’t find that the same anywhere else. Lots of folks in this world are in a bubble. Especially in Singapore where there is virtually no eye contact. The contrast is noticible to me when I go home every 2–3 years. The only place I’ve found a similar level of congeniality is in Irish Pubs. A good conversation is always to be had!",0

Get some first hand experience and judge for yourselves. America is anything but a terrible place to live! It’s wonderful! That said, I cherish the friends and the experiences I’ve had in my 15 years abroad, and adore my Indonesian wife and her family. I’ve just also really come to appreciate the good old USA!

But behind the scenes, current and former employees on her leading daytime show say they faced racism, fear, and intimidation. “That ‘be kind’ bullshit only happens when the cameras are on. It’s all for show,” one former employee told BuzzFeed News. “I know they give money to people and help them out, but it’s for show.” BuzzFeed News spoke to one current and 10 former employees on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, all of whom asked to remain anonymous, fearing retribution from the award-winning NBC daytime talk show and others in the entertainment industry. They said they were fired after taking medical leave or bereavement days to attend family funerals. One employee, who claims she was fed up with comments about her race, essentially walked off the job. Others said they were also instructed by their direct managers to not speak to DeGeneres if they saw her around the office. Most of the former employees blamed executive producers and other senior managers for the day-to-day toxicity, but one former employee said that, ultimately, it’s Ellen’s name on the show and “she really needs to take more responsibility” for the workplace environment. “If she wants to have her own show and have her name on the show title, she needs to be more involved to see what's going on,” one former employee said. “I think the executive producers surround her and tell her, ‘Things are going great, everybody's happy,’ and she just believes that, but it's her responsibility to go beyond that.” In a joint statement to BuzzFeed News, executive producers Ed Glavin, Mary Connelly, and Andy Lassner said they take the stories of the employees ""very seriously."" ""Over the course of nearly two decades, 3,000 episodes, and employing over 1000 staff members, we have strived to create an open, safe, and inclusive work environment,"" they said. ""We are truly heartbroken and sorry to learn that even one person in our production family has had a negative experience. It’s not who we are and not who we strive to be, and not the mission Ellen has set for us. ""For the record, the day to day responsibility of the Ellen show is completely on us. We take all of this very seriously and we realize, as many in the world are learning, that we need to do better, are committed to do better, and we will do better."" A Black woman who used to work on The Ellen DeGeneres Show told BuzzFeed News she experienced racist comments, actions, and “microaggressions” during her year and a half as an employee. She said when she was hired, a senior-level producer told her and another Black employee, “Oh wow, you both have box braids; I hope we don’t get you confused.” And at a work party, she said, one of the main writers told her, “I’m sorry, I only know the names of the white people who work here,” and other coworkers “awkwardly laughed it off” instead of coming to her defense. When the former employee brought up issues of race and representation on the show and asked producers not to use offensive terms like “spirit animal” in segments, her colleagues called her “the PC police.” When she started to speak up about the discrimination, she said, all of her colleagues distanced themselves from her. “Whenever I brought up an issue to my white male boss, he would bring up some random story about some random Black friend that he had and how they managed to get over stuff,” she said. “He would use his Black friend as some way to say, ‘I understand your struggle.’ But it was all performative bullshit.” After one year at Ellen, she said she asked for a raise after learning another recent hire made double for doing the same job, despite her having worked in the television industry for a decade. Her manager told her “they’d see what they could do,” but months went by and nothing happened, she said.",0

After the meeting, she left work for the day and never returned to The Ellen DeGeneres Show. She said she has no plans to ever work in the entertainment industry again. For years, she felt “a fear of speaking out” but is now inspired to share her experience because of recent conversations about race in Hollywood and other workplaces. “I feel like I’m not alone in this,” she said. “We all feel this. We’ve been feeling this way, but I’ve been too afraid to say anything because everyone knows what happens when you say something as a Black person. You’re blacklisted.” The former employee also said her manager from Ellen recently reached out to her amid the Black Lives Matter protests to apologize for not being a better ally. But the former employee said it's too little, too late. “I feel angry about the way I was treated, and I am always going to stand up for Black, Indigenous, Latino, and Asian people, regardless if they’re around,” she said. “I can’t not say anything. I’m not going to stop talking.” We want your help!

There have been rumors for years about DeGeneres being difficult and how many employees feel unhappy. In March, comedian Kevin T. Porter started a Twitter thread asking people to share “the most insane stories you’ve heard about Ellen [DeGeneres] being mean.” The tweet has more than 2,600 replies. In April, Variety reported that employees were “distressed and outraged” by top-level producers who didn’t communicate details about their jobs and pay at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. DeGeneres’s former bodyguard also recently said he had had a negative experience with her at the 2014 Oscars, calling the TV host’s treatment of others “demeaning.” A spokesperson for Warner Bros. Television, which distributes the show, told Variety that the crew was consistently paid during the pandemic, although at reduced hours, and “acknowledged that communication could have been better, but cited complications due to the chaos caused by COVID-19.” A current employee told BuzzFeed News that on May 1, the same day the story about the former bodyguard was published, executive producers took the rare move of holding an all-staff meeting over Zoom to address the negative stories and low morale. “I think it is a lot of smoke and mirrors when it comes to the show’s brand,” a former employee said. “They pull on people’s heartstrings; they do know that’s going to get likes and what people are going to go for, which is a positive message. But that’s not always reality.”",0

But the week they returned to work, they were told their position was being eliminated. “You'd think that if someone just tried to kill themselves, you don’t want to add any more stress to their lives,” the employee, whose story was corroborated by four other employees and medical records, told BuzzFeed News. “Some of the producers talk openly in public about addiction and mental health awareness, but they’re the reason there’s a stigma,” they said. “They definitely don’t practice what they preach with the ‘be kind’ mantra."" Another former employee said they were fired after an unexpectedly difficult year that required them to take time away from the job on three occasions: medical leave for three weeks after they were in a car accident, working remotely for two days to attend a family member’s funeral, and then three days off to travel for another family member’s funeral. Each request was a battle with supervisors and HR, they added. “That’s the definition of a toxic work environment, where they make you feel like you’re going insane and then you’re like, no, everything I was feeling was right. It was all leading up to this,” the former staffer, whose story was corroborated by five former employees and medical records, said. A third former employee said they were given a warning for creating a GoFundMe campaign to raise money for medical costs that weren’t covered by their company health insurance and then sharing it on social media. Just 24 hours after posting the GoFundMe, they said, they were called into the department head’s office and told to take it down because of concerns it might hurt DeGeneres’s image. “They discovered my fundraiser, then got mad at me. … They were more concerned about Ellen’s brand instead of helping me out,” the former employee, whose story was corroborated by four other employees, told BuzzFeed News. About one month later, this employee said they were fired after posting a selfie laughing with coworkers at the office on a personal Instagram story — a violation of their contract — even though others had posted similar photos before. “Be kind to the world,” they said, “not your employees.”",0

Those who push back against senior producers don’t usually have their contracts renewed, former employees said. “They hire people who maybe are inexperienced with how a functional, nontoxic work environment actually is, or someone who just wants to be in that atmosphere so bad that they'll put up with it,” one former employee claimed. “They kind of feed off of that, like, ‘This is Ellen; this is as good as it gets. You'll never find anything better than this.’” According to former staffers, those who have “more likable” personality traits, who are willing to work the 10-plus-hour days without complaint, and who actively ignore how managers and senior-level producers treat others have been given new iPhones, JetBlue gift cards, and other swag the show keeps on hand from its sponsors. “I remember feeling depressed and horrible and sad and just thinking that I can’t leave but I want to leave,” one former employee said. “Everyone was unhappy unless you were one of those people being favored.” Some employees defended the show’s work culture, saying it’s typical of TV production, but other former employees with experience in the industry said The Ellen DeGeneres Show stood apart as particularly negative. “We all have a kind of ‘this isn’t normal’ feeling about how people get treated there,” one former employee claimed. “And there’s this ushering out the door. Or your contract isn’t renewed the minute you ruffle anyone’s feathers. Or you don't show that you're extremely grateful and appreciative to work there.” The employees who spoke to BuzzFeed News said they worked in a culture dominated by fear. One of them said a general feeling among staffers was “if you have an issue, don't even think about bringing it up.” “I never felt like it was safe to go to my manager when I had issues — because this was the same person who would wait for me to go to the bathroom and then message me, asking me where I was and why I wasn’t at my desk,” one employee said. “People focus on rumors about how Ellen is mean and everything like that, but that's not the problem. The issue is these three executive producers running the show who are in charge of all these people [and] who make the culture and are putting out this feeling of bullying and being mean,” another former employee claimed. “They feel that everybody who works at The Ellen Show is lucky to work there — ‘So if you have a problem, you should leave because we’ll hire someone else because everybody wants to work here.’” And when people did leave — or get fired — managers never addressed the team about it, employees said. “We had Friday morning weekly meetings, and sometimes people who we worked with forever just wouldn’t be there,” one former employee said, “like, they disappeared, and it was never explained."" ●",0

To his relief, DeGeneres will remain a part of the Warner Bros. fold, having built a sprawling portfolio of unscripted shows there in recent years, including Fox’s The Masked Dancer, NBC’s Ellen’s Game of Games and HBO Max’s Ellen’s Next Great Designer. The studio has a considerable stake in her Ellen Digital Ventures, too, which is responsible for more than 60 original series, including digital hit Momsplaining With Kristen Bell. Though DeGeneres, who’s also producing natural history specials and documentaries for Discovery and returned to stand-up with a celebrated Netflix special in 2018, is coy about her next chapter, she is hopeful a juicy acting role and more time for her conservation efforts are a part of it.",0

2. Her comedy is rarely as self-deprecating as might be expected. DeGeneres often makes fun of others more than she does herself.
3. She seems “ill at ease"" when she's doing interviews, despite having been in that business for nearly two decades.
4. When the cameras cut to medium shots of DeGeneres and her guests on her show, her facial expressions and body language often are not “in sync"" with what's required for moment. She doesn't seem to be able to feign interest or empathy for extended periods of time.
5. The recent news from her current and former employees indicates that she's a deeply insecure person who requires the total subjugation of those in her orbit. Those closest to her seem to find her to be an unhappy and vindictive person, and she doesn't seem to be disguising that too effectively.

Most comedians aren’t nice people - It takes a series of personal setbacks and humiliations in someone’s youth to make them a successful comedian. While that makes the person funny, it can also make them bitter, angry, and deeply insecure. Given DeGeneres known history, there’s every reason to believe that she’s suffering from the legacy of the above.
2. She seems to have trouble expressing real emotions like empathy or sympathy - Carefully watching DeGeneres talk show, it’s often as mean-spirited as it is funny. The “laughs at scares” segments really aren’t that funny, and she doesn’t seem to understand or appreciate that. Also, when she’s supposed to be empathetic or sympathetic it comes across as artificial and “forced”.
3. Her past lovers haven’t expressed positive sentiments about her - It’s not as if her past girlfriends are in the media stating what a great person she is. Even if we assume that some are bisexual or closeted (her affair with actor Anne Heche indicates that this is likely) she should have a number of past lovers who speak highly of her, but she doesn’t.
4. Her performances indicate that she’s not “nice” - Watching her recent comedy special, it’s clear that despite being wealthy and successful, DeGeneres harbors a number of bad feelings about some people and a great deal of hostility. Considering her age and again her wealth, that’s at best sad, and at worst an indicator of a deeply troubled person who holds grudges.
Ellen DeGeneres is famous, funny, and popular. None of those are synonymous with being “nice”; nor should they be.",0

I kept thinking “wait does she want to talk to me???? Isn’t she on a time crunch to get to the White House??? She’s standing two feet in front of me and wants to talk and is turned to me with no one else around me.

There was not one story where what was reported closely corresponded to what happened. NOT ONE. Instead in every story the same general thing happened, a villain was conjured into existence, one or more heroes in conflict with the villain were celebrated, natural inevitable phenomena resulting from physics or biology were transformed into intentional malfeasance on the part of the villain and opposed by the heroes, the dangers were exaggerated to an incredible level, emotional fervor was incited, and the truth of what actually happened was lost. EVERY SINGLE TIME, NO EXCEPTIONS. The saving grace was that in some I was one of the heroes and never the villain :-) But the phenomenon is clear. The actual factual truth is never the story.

Neither side ever just lays out all the facts and argues the merits. Pretty much routinely the actual facts are cherry picked, a story is concocted about the issues and the story of the defendant and the story of the plaintiff are argued compared to each other. This is even more true for jury trials since lawyers understand that people can understand stories while understanding reality is not always as easy. Often I have heard experienced lawyers express the sentiment that every jury trial is a “liar’s contest” meaning not that either side is stating lies but rather that by omitting pertinent truths what wins is the best partially true but ultimately false and incomplete story.",0

Indeed, if the stories turned out to be accurate and true I would be gobsmacked. The same is true of political stories. I remember a while ago there was a case in Chicago where some celebrity actor claimed to have been approached in Chicago of all places and a noose put around his head and I think he was threatened because they were Trump supporters. It took about two milliseconds of hearing that story to think - the chance that is true is zero. Chicago is hardly loaded with Trump supporters. Two Trump supporters walking around holding a noose is absurdly unlikely. And the fact that they approached and anti-Trump celebrity on the streets to threaten him is similarly a million to one likelihood. The Press and Politicians made a big deal of it. . . . . and it all turned out to be a complete hoax. There are many such hoaxes. So when I hear an unlikely story, I am dubious. Relating this to Ellen DeGeneres, not knowing her but having heard her talk many times, my impression is that she is a fairly perfectionistic, controlling person who is intolerant of people who disagree with her. In my experience, this is not uncommon among successful people - not a nice trait but common. Could I imagine her berating someone in her employ who is unprepared or does what she thinks is a bad job? Sure. Could I imagine someone in a less powerful position being jealous or fearful or resentful of her and see her harsh attention focused on them as odious? Sure. As the old saying goes, “no man is a hero to his valet.” But do I think that she is so crazily abusive and out of control as the stories posit . . . .not likely at all. And not worth a minute of my time to be concerned about.",0

Ted Stevens, who let an oil executive pay to renovate his home, Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell, who took cash from a vitamin executive, and even Louisiana Rep.

She doesn’t like political labels, or people who tell gay people that they can't get married, or anyone who thinks they know better when it comes to a woman's reproductive organs. (My brother and I take after her.) My father was the mayor of our small town in central New York for 11 years. My mother played the role of First Lady dutifully while my brother and I mostly just whined about all the banquet dinners we were forced to attend because it meant we would have to miss TGIF and SNICK. My father is currently in Cleveland as a delegate who intends to vote for Donald J. Trump. My mother, brother, and I are currently battling an ever-swirling barrage of emotions that range from confusion to fear to rage. But here’s the thing, America! Somewhere along the way, we stopped listening to each other (or just became frighteningly good at ignoring anyone with an opposing viewpoint). And in these dark times, don’t we owe it to ourselves to hear each other out? That’s why I offered good ol’ Dad a proposition of sorts: You explain to me just what the hell is going on at the Republican National Convention during day one and I’ll try to keep an open mind while watching from home on C-SPAN. Oh, and we’ll publish the texts on GQ, lightly cleaned up. GQ: What was the scene like yesterday in Cleveland when you got there? Dad: Very organized and in reality rather calm. Obviously most people just arriving but excitement in anticipated events. Kick off entertainment and fireworks was outstanding. Three Dog Night rocked it at the outside venue at the RRHOF.

They are around but in certain contained areas. So far very peaceful. We have seen a great amount of appreciation to law enforcement. People going up and thanking them, etc. The protesters have been appreciative of the law enforcement? Yes. I have seen attendees, regular citizens, and even some protest groups show appreciation as we walk from our hotel to the convention center about five blocks away. That’s awesome to hear. In the wake of Dallas and Baton Rouge, was that a concern of yours at all going to Cleveland? Sure. Large crowd, media attention, etc. You have to have it in the back of your mind. More likely from the outside as opposed to attendees. You just have to be aware of your surroundings but not limit your engagement. Out of nowhere he texts me the following photo. Where does one buy that hat? And if I get one for you, will you wear it for the rest of the convention? It’s from your current state—Florida. Not really proper New York attire.",0
1444698953153404941,Chris Christie is the scum of the Earth https://t.co/3Q6Px0kfMk,"A protester broke in and headed to the NY delegation! 😊 No one seems too concerned by his presence? He was actually part of one of the states and has been all over with the “Hillary for Prison” sign. Not sure if he’s a delegate or just a Trump supporter. How palpable are the anti-Hillary feelings at the RNC in general? I mean, obviously no one there wants her to win, because that means you guys lose, but… Very high dislike. But I think it’s almost a feeling of what constituents will feel is the less of two evils, per se. I know this is your first RNC, but you’ve been involved in politics for a while now. Have you ever seen a race between two people where things have gotten this heated? Like, it doesn’t feel like either side is against making this personal. Die-hard Trump supporters have no boundaries. Traditional Republicans certainly are apprehensive of some of the things that have been said and done, but all agree Hillary is simply an extension of the Obama administration and the Democratic agenda, which is built on lies. Interesting. What is the Republican agenda built on then? Making America Great Again! Deregulation, responsible spending, strong military, and strong economy! Not tax-and-spend liberal programs for all so we can get reelected. Is fighting to ensure equal rights for queer and transgender people part of that agenda? Because Mike Pence is the only politician on the Trump-Pence ticket that has actual in-office experience and he has verrrrry actively been against equal rights for same-sex couples. I think that unfortunately the message will have us on the wrong side of history. However, I can tell you that there are strong feelings by many to be more socially ‘liberal,’ but the conservative base has a ways to go to bring them along. Do you think that is the biggest challenge right now facing the Republican Party internally? The battle between being more socially liberal while maintaining a more conservative economic policy when it comes to spending? I feel like the word “liberal” has become such a negative term for most Republicans that sometimes having a more socially liberal viewpoint on things like equality for same-sex couples, women’s health, etc., is deemed as contradictory to what makes a Republican a Republican, just because it has the word “liberal” in it. I think the Republican Party overall has to become more tolerant of certain social issues. But again, many are not anti-gay. But in order to keep the conservative right wingers somewhat on board, it’s a real balancing act. That has not been mastered and therefore is one area that currently we are seen as against. Unfortunately, in my opinion. But conservatives have strong feelings around these issues and especially the Constitution. So the balancing act is trying to appease the far-right conservatives who make up a large portion of the Republican Party right now? That way they just don’t go off and make their own party?",0
1444698953153404941,Chris Christie is the scum of the Earth https://t.co/3Q6Px0kfMk,"Correct. Apparently we have to go to a roll call vote at four as the “conservatives” have managed to force a vote on certain rule changes. I.e. the nomination. More to come as I understand the situation. Woah, that’s sorta crazy. What type of rules do they want to change? This is an example of the fractured party scenario. Not totally clear, but I assume it’s to allow delegates to vote without being bound. See article on Politico. They apparently have an inside source. We are scrambling to recall all of the NY delegates that may have left for lunch, nap, etc. in preparation for prime time. Other states doing the same. A lot of activity on the floor awaiting next steps. So basically this is the last ditch effort to get Trump out as nominee? I believe so but just starting back up. Pandemonium has broken out on the floor between states! A lot of “USA” chanting along with “Trump, Trump, Trump” chanting. Why? About the vote? Are the people chanting “USA” on one side of the issue while people chanting “Trump” are on the other side? No, it was those chants to override the “NO” votes. Oooh, gotcha. This is like some pro wrestling shit. It’s definitely something to witness live! Still ongoing. Trying to calm everyone down. Utah seems to be the issue. G. E. Smith is the live entertainment. Former Saturday Night Live band leader. They are really good!!!!! Have you seen anyone playing Pokemon GO? No. But so far the Texas Delegation is the most active. Same matching shirts and hats. Cheering, dancing, etc. Definitely dancing in their seats and generally look to be having a great time. Question: Do any of your fellow delegates know you married a woman and had two children with her and that none of them are voting for Trump? You will come to you senses. 24 hours in politics is a lifetime. You will be converted. Are you more ashamed of our political leanings or embarrassed by them? Upset that I spent and continue to pay a high rate for your education and you think Hillary and the Fems are what’s right. You have all drank the Kool-Aid! Do you mean Hillary and the Dems? Or is “Hillary and the Fems” some new term you learned at the convention? Hillary and the Fems would make a pretty great riot grrrl band name, though. I meant to ask, did you watch Trump and Pence’s 60 Minutes interview? I did not but one of my coworkers said it was pathetic? It was…not great. My favorite parts were when the interviewer would ask Pence a question, and Trump would interrupt him and speak over him. Have you gotten any more gifts or swag bags? Yes, but in the hotel. Pins, T-shirts, etc. I’ll have to look later. I’m back at the convention hall. Have people calmed down or is it still a little crazy?",0

Yes, to introduce his wife. What are people’s thoughts on Melania speaking tonight? She hasn’t been super vocal during the campaign itself. I think people are looking forward to what she says and how. Same as the celebrities. They seriously have the dude from Duck Dynasty speaking right now!?!? He was actually very good. Seriously. Holy shit, the pastor said Democrats are “the enemy” during the benediction!?! How is that a thing? I’m not hearing evil and enemy. It’s their goal to lie about the facts and the media endorses that message. It goes both ways, I’m not denying that. But that pastor just referred to Democrats as “the enemy.” He just said that! Chris Christie has arrived. New Jersey group right next to us. How are you gonna tell me Democrats lie and follow it up with “Chris Christie has arrived”? He’s the modern-day poster boy for lying! I’m just saying he arrived. Not part of response. This is a serious question for ya. You talked earlier about how a huge thing for the Republican Party is to stick together. That even though the conservatives have very different view points, you need them to make the party strong. Well, that same logic holds for the Republican Party and the Democratic Party, right? You need both to cooperate to make the USA the strongest nation possible. So why is there so much language being through around tonight about how Democrats are “the enemy”? I’m trying to watch this, not text every 2 seconds. At this point I could tell I was losing my dad. My only hope to rein him back into the task at hand was by calling in my secret weapon: my mother, via group text. I feel like this article could use a motherly touch in it, don’t you, Father? Mom, how does it make you feel to see your beloved husband front row and center at the RNC? Mom: Honestly, it makes me nervous. I hope he is safe and I am soooooo glad he is not wearing one of those hats!! Good point. Dad, where is your Make America Great Again hat? The white and blue would match your suit! Mom: I will say, Chachi is still looking good. That is who was on when I turned the TV on. Can you tell him I had his posters on my wall in the early 80s? Mom, would you care to explain your attraction to men who identify as Republican? Is it one of those things where you think you can fix them? Mom: I think it’s my natural instinct to never judge or form an opinion about someone based on one error in judgement. Oh my heck, did you know Anthony Sabato Jr. was a Calvin Klein underwear model? And…..he was a GQ Man of the Year in 1997!",0
1444698953153404941,Chris Christie is the scum of the Earth https://t.co/3Q6Px0kfMk,"What? Why do you know that? Dad: The Christies are sitting next to us. Media is swarming us! Mom: I just saw you on TV! Can you tell McCaul that if he wants to make America “safe” again, please don’t let anyone other than the military or police have assault weapons?? 🙌🏼 Did Giuliani just perform an exorcism on stage? Mom: Rudy is PISSED. Did you see poor Tiffany sitting by herself? Oh, boy. Here we go. Wait, is Trump seriously walking out to Freddie Mercury right now? Melania is the good type of immigrant, right? Mom: Really—her hardworking life traveling the world and working in FASHION??? What a bunch of BS. It is so fake!! Melania cares about other women though, Mom! She just said it! I can’t believe I’m watching Flynn’s speech right now. With my father still unresponsive to any of my texts, I was left only to hope that his phone had actually died and that he had left the convention hall for his hotel following Michel—, errr, I mean Melania’s speech instead of sticking around for Michael Flynn’s incoherent rambling and awkward attempts to get “Trump” and “USA” chants started inside a depleted arena (“That’s right! USA! You got it!”). We would have to reconvene the following morning. And reconvene we did. Soooo, I guess the big thing to discuss is Melania’s speech. What did you think of it? Dad: I thought overall it was a speech she delivered well. However, the way it appeared anyways, it was more of a written, prepared speech as opposed to a from-the-heart speech. I would say there were part of it that certainly touched on a personal feel. There were also parts that were almost word-for-word plagiarized from Michelle Obama’s 2008 convention speech, which isn’t a great look. Did you guys hear about that last night on the floor? ‘Cause Twitter went crazy about it. Obviously no one knew that at the time. It became known later in the evening. Again, the tone and points are certainly general statements that anyone could make, but since it was obviously prepared someone should have caught, at the least, the similarity. Especially when you’ve been painting the Obamas as the scum of the Earth. That was a big theme of last night. That Obama and Hillary have created all these enemies for us and that we aren’t safe. That we must take down the enemies. Giuliani and Flynn were especially impassioned about this. The theme of Day 1 was “Make America Safe Again.” Did you leave the convention feeling like there is a good plan put in place to make America safe again? It was not the purpose of the speakers to lay out the entire plan. That’s the job of the candidate. I think what the speakers were expressing was that a Trump administration will handle the military and diplomatic relations in a much more direct manner. Obama administration has undoubtedly been weak. Most great leaders in the past have clearly said that you have power with a strong military and a strong economy. That’s the fundamental issue with the Dems policies.",0
1444698953153404941,Chris Christie is the scum of the Earth https://t.co/3Q6Px0kfMk,"What was your reaction to Giuliani? Did you guys think he was a little over the top? I thought he was engaged and passionate. He is one of the few that really fired the place up. He definitely got excited! Did you stick around for Flynn’s speech after Melania, or did you leave before that? Because that had to be one of the most awkward things I’ve seen. I was there. It was unfortunate. How could anyone follow the main figure? Trump himself should have never been on stage if others were to follow his wife. Dumb logistics. You had Flynn watching 1,000 leaving and him trying to address the crowd. Yeah, to be fair to him, they didn’t put him in a good position. Horrible. If it was only her, no issue. But once Trump himself came on it was over. Melania should have been the finale. Do you feel like night one was a success, a failure, or somewhere in-between in terms of delivering the Republican Party message? Somewhere in-between. I felt they could have had fewer key speakers and hit the mark. I did not even know that. Was that the husband and wife from Wisconsin? He is actually a U.S. Representative with eight kids! I’m sure the TV personality helped but he was well spoken. Remember, most political speakers are likely to be future appointments or candidates themselves. Speaking at the convention is a step in future potential. I.e. Obama. No one knew him but he nailed the Dem convention speech and propelled him upward. Obviously nothing at this stage is of the game is going to make you suddenly switch and vote for Hillary, but are you all-in on the Trump message? Or is it still the lesser of two evils motif you mentioned yesterday? I will never vote for Hillary. It’s wrong for the country. But I still need and want Trump to define the platform, outline his policies, etc., and then I think maybe a shift could happen. He can win and it could be good for America. But undoubtedly it’s still a lot of uncertainty currently that we need to feel comfortable moving beyond. We are in a different type of never-seen-before candidacy.

Didn't realise it would be that crowded during festival season. We didn't even know it was an Indian Street at the time!

That said, once he does get out, if the GOP has gone so far they have no moral qualms about running a convicted murderer and felon, I don't believe there is any legal barrier to him running, provided his parole officer approves his campaign travel and possibly moving out of state.",0

It would be interesting to see the White House trying to coordinate the VPs travel and meeting schedule with the requirements of being on parole. Would Minnesota have the authority to send the VP back to prison if he violates his parole?",0
1444698953153404941,Chris Christie is the scum of the Earth https://t.co/3Q6Px0kfMk,Of course Chauvin can run as Vice President to Donald Trump if Trump is not incapacitated with old age or if Trump will run. Convicted prisoners can run for any government post subject to States law. Texas won’t allow it. Eugene V. Debs runfor presidency in 1920.,0
1444698953153404941,Chris Christie is the scum of the Earth https://t.co/3Q6Px0kfMk,Technically yes. Nothing in the Constitution prohibits someone in jail from running for office. Seriously though that is an extremely dumb question.,0

1444698953153404941,Chris Christie is the scum of the Earth https://t.co/3Q6Px0kfMk,"If Chauvin were in prison, it would be impossible, but as the left lives in a world of untruth it’s probable, given all of the nationwide negative publicity by the media blaming him for Floyd’s drug-induced death, that he will successfully be able to claim that there is no venue in which he could get a fair trial. A juror wearing a BLM t-shirt and commenting on Chauvin’s guilt BEFORE being selected for the jury is one hint at that truth.",0
1444698953153404941,Chris Christie is the scum of the Earth https://t.co/3Q6Px0kfMk,LMAO here at this question. No Chauvin will not be a Trump running mate. But they sure would be great together as cellmates!!,0

And 2, Chauvin is accused of murder. Both of them may be in jail together at that time. They might run for president and vp of the jail.",0
1444698953153404941,Chris Christie is the scum of the Earth https://t.co/3Q6Px0kfMk,"This post doesn’t deserve an answer simply because Derek Chauvin has been convicted of murdering George Floyd and is expected to be sentenced soon. Also, Donald Trump himself might be sitting in prison by the time all is said and done. I would not hang any hopes that this simpering con artist pathological criminal liar will be running in 2024. If, hypothetically, America voted for Donald Trump to run in 2024, I declare before you, the United States of America would have gone stark raving mad and is no longer the land of the free, BUT the FIRST CLASS POSTER COUNTRY FOR ALL IDIOTS AND MORONS!",0
1444698953153404941,Chris Christie is the scum of the Earth https://t.co/3Q6Px0kfMk,"Derek Chauvin meets the qualifications to be a president of the United States, but with his history of lying, violence, corruption etc. and his current convictions on 3 felon counts of murder and manslaughter, does the United States really want, need and/or desire someone with the morals and ethics like Chauvin in any political office.
I have found it interesting that some continue to make heroes out of unconvicted and convicted criminals that continue to Not support the United States Constitution and the basic tenets that founded the United States of America.",0

You're probably asking this question because you saw a Facebook or Whatsapp text saying that Justin Beiber is a girl. Which is wrong. Here's your answer, JB is a boy. Everytime a male singer, or a boy band reach a certain level of popularity among the opposite sex, they tend to be called Gay, or female or anything that may seem demeaning. It's what happened with one direction, and now it's also happening with BTS. Justin Beiber, one direction, BTS are all good artists. Doing​ petty things like calling them girls, is done only to get attention, or at least a reaction. You could make your own opinion, or decide to be among those who take Facebook posts seriously.

People try to use excuses to ""prove"" he is gay, like ""he looks like a girl"" or ""he has a high pitched voice"". These excuses are easily refutable, due to the fact that he hit puberty later than usual and the fact that everyone is different. The whole ""Justin Bieber is gay because he looks like a girl"" excuse is stupid and shows no logic, that's like saying a bearded man who is overweight and balding is a ""creep who lives in his mother's basement"", because of the way he looks and how men like that are depicted on TV, while in reality, that ""overweight, balding man with a beard who looks like a creep"" could be the owner of a multi-million dollar company and have a very hot wife.",1

1444664211959918592,@solthysunne justin bieber is GAY and IDIOT!!!!!!!!,"Not everybody. The first and main reason is they fuc**ng don't know anything about him. They listen it from other people who listened from some other stupids. Around in 2014(don't know exactly) a pic of him kissing other guy made rounds in social media. From then the people started saying he's a gay and we know how blindly people started believing whatever they see in social media sites and getting fooled. The truth is that photo which made rounds is photoshopped. There's a girl between Justin and other guy, whom they were kissing on cheeks. I wonder why people say that he slept with many models when they say he's gay!!!",0

So there are people who still don't want to accept that his music is good, even though he has a Grammy now. agreed, people have different music tastes but it's a known fact that the majority of the people who're really his fans act the opposite in fear of being bullied and are embarrassed because the majority of his fans are females (that's another thing now, anybody who has more female fans than male fans is considered a loser, smh), while the only people who bully others for being a Bieber fan are people who have nothing else to do with their lives than bully/hate people for something they like/love.they're basically afraid and embarrassed of themselves and i'm not surprised. if my mind set was as hateful and messed up as theirs, i'd feel the same way too. so yeah..that's why.lol",1

1444664211959918592,@solthysunne justin bieber is GAY and IDIOT!!!!!!!!,Because they don't like him without even knowing about him.

Well at some point of time, people started to believe that being gay is in some way, insulting. If someone is gay, it is an outrageous thing, and it is insulting to be associated with such a person.

1444664211959918592,@solthysunne justin bieber is GAY and IDIOT!!!!!!!!,Concluding; people call Bieber gay because they don't like him and they believe that being called gay should be an insult to him. That's it.,1

1444664211959918592,@solthysunne justin bieber is GAY and IDIOT!!!!!!!!,"The only basis people say this on is the fact that puberty hit him kinda late .

I love him though. Cause he is the most handsome boy ever. Though I don't understand why people hate him. At early stage he became a star so he has no one to guide him. So he can go little bad.

1444653442421624832,Chris Christie is trash,"Has there ever been a political reversal of fortune as rapid and as absolute as the one just experienced by Chris Christie? At warp speed, the governor of New Jersey has gone from the most popular politician in the country to the most embattled; from the Republicans’ brightest hope for 2016 to a man with an FBI target on his back. One minute, he was releasing jokey vanity videos starring Alec Baldwin and assorted celebrity pals; the next, he was being ridiculed by his lifelong idol, Bruce Springsteen. Mere weeks ago, Christie was a straight-talking, corruption-busting everyman. Now, he is a liar, a bully, a buffoon. What is remarkable about this meltdown is that it isn’t the result of some deep secret that has been exposed to the world, revealing a previously unimagined side to the candidate. Many of the scandals and mini-scandals and scandals-within-scandals that the national media is salivating over have been in full view for years. Even the now-infamous Bridgegate was percolating for months before it exploded into the first major story of the next presidential race. Case in point: Last year, just before Thanksgiving, I traveled to Trenton to see Bill Baroni, Christie’s top staff appointee at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, get grilled by state legislators about the closure of access lanes to the George Washington Bridge in September. It was clear that something fishy was going on. Baroni gave a command performance, defending the closures as part of a traffic study, but more than that, as a matter of justice. Discussing whether Fort Lee deserved three dedicated lanes during rush hour, Baroni demanded, “Is this fair?” His voice actually cracked with emotion. “And if it is not fair, how do you not study it?” But there were only a handful of reporters in the room to witness his melodramatics, and it was six weeks before the national media caught on to the story. Outside New Jersey, at least, it seemed inconceivable that Christie, good-government evangelist, scourge of Soprano State shenanigans, could preside over a piece of payback so outrageous and so petty.",0

Yesterday, I attempted to communicate with an irate reader who was deeply offended by the beginning of John Hubbuch’s column this week in Viewpoints. The column was mostly about local politics, but John started off with a swipe at Hillary Clinton, calling her “the most famous cuckquean in American history.” The word “cuckquean,” Hubbuch briefly explained is the female version of “cuckold,” which is what set off the outrage. The caller said it was an obscene reference, demeaning and derogatory toward women, a direct reference to a sexual fetish.",0
1444624139503996929,Pretty sure Hillary Clinton is a cuckquean,"That left me “blutterbunged,” an archaic term for flustered and flabbergasted. I tried to explain that “cuckold” was not an obscenity but an old English word for a husband whose wife has been unfaithful to him. My dictionary, in fact, defines it as just that, “the husband of an unfaithful wife.” The verb form means to “make a cuckold of (a husband).” Shakespeare and Moliere both used the term, which originally derives from the “cuckoo’s habit of laying its eggs in other birds’ nests.” “Cuckquean” is the female equivalent–the wife of an unfaithful husband–an obvious reference to the philandering ways of Bill Clinton.

1444624139503996929,Pretty sure Hillary Clinton is a cuckquean,"Cuckold. We all know the term used to describe a man whose wife has committed adultery. But do you know what to call a woman whose husband has been unfaithful to her? I didn’t either. We haven’t needed to know the generic word, not when we’ve had more personal, more sensational names to attach to the concept. Names like Jen, Silda, Elizabeth, Hillary and now (yet again) Hillary’s close political aide and adviser, Huma. After the New York Post published text and images from her husband, Anthony Weiner’s latest round of sexual Twitter exchanges with a woman he met online, Huma Abedin has announced her separation from the disgraced former congressman and New York City mayoral candidate. I had to Google the answer to my question. According to Webster’s Unabridged Dictionary, a betrayed wife is a “cuckquean.” It’s a term that Microsoft Word doesn’t recognize and insists I’m misspelling, and that other dictionaries describe as “obsolete.”",0
1444624139503996929,Pretty sure Hillary Clinton is a cuckquean,"In a culture in which we still generally at least pay lip service to monogamy, why don’t we have a readily available term to describe a betrayed woman? Is it because we’ve historically just assumed that philandering husbands are the norm and it’s only a roaming wife who’s an anomaly? Or because, typical or not, the status of betrayed wife just isn’t worthy of distinction, just isn’t important enough to merit its own term? Unlike “cuckold,” which used to carry an implicit tone of scorn, the definition of cuckquean is purely descriptive. But ironically, one “success” of the women’s movement is that these days, having an adulterous wife now makes a man more an object of sympathy than of scorn, while staying married to an unfaithful husband now subjects a woman to more derision than compassion. In a man, it is seen as a sign of commitment, in a woman a troubling lack of self-respect. But in both cases, tolerating infidelity is seen as essentially feminine -- a quality now admirable in men and a sign of retrograde weakness in women. “Poor, poor Huma,” wrote Kat, a Millennial colleague of mine, a woman in her early 30s. “I’m glad she’s finally pulling the trigger — I want so badly to respect her but it’s been hard (though I get it… kinda).” I’m with her, and trying to figure out why. In this July 23, 2013 file photo, Huma Abedin, alongside her husband, then-New York mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner, speaks during a news conference in New York. (Kathy Willens/AP) Anthony Weiner’s compulsive self-exposure, both literal and metaphorical, blazes a uniquely destructive path. Not only did he essentially cheat on his wife, but he did it repeatedly. Not only did he do it on Twitter, but in a documentary for which he allegedly did not obtain Huma’s permission. And not only did he do it randomly, but also knowingly with a vocal supporter of Donald Trump, someone with a clear and obvious motive to publicize their exchanges. Beyond narcissistic, it’s hard not to see his behavior as actively hostile. But how should we regard his wife’s? “After long and painful consideration and work on my marriage, I have made the decision to separate from my husband,” Huma wrote in a statement. “Anthony and I remain devoted to doing what is best for our son, who is the light of our life.” Can it be that simple? Is it possible that like so many women in difficult marriages, she loved a deeply flawed man, tried to honor her promises to him, and sought to keep him as an active and engaged father to her son (or at least did until their 5-year-old showed up in one of Weiner’s texts sleeping next to his sexting and aroused father)? Or does her visibility and status as a trusted aide to another high-profile (and more reviled) woman preclude such straightforward interpretation? As I try to unravel this knot of conflicting responses, I wonder if we conflate commitment with weakness, not just Huma Abedin’s commitment to her husband, but Hillary Clinton’s commitment to Huma.",0
1444624139503996929,Pretty sure Hillary Clinton is a cuckquean,"Certainly Donald Trump does. As usual, he has lost no time in spinning someone else’s misfortune into an opportunity for mud-slinging and self-aggrandizement. “I only worry for the country in that Hillary Clinton was careless and negligent in allowing Weiner to have such close proximity to highly classified information,” he wrote. “Who knows what he learned and who he told? It’s just another example of Hillary Clinton’s bad judgment. It is possible that our country and its security have been greatly compromised by this.” By that standard, we should all be alarmed by Trump’s disclosing everything he’s learned in his national security briefing to his wife Melania, who probably illegally worked in this country without the proper visa. (Oh, did I say “probably”? Yes, but by Trump standards, “probably” — even “possibly” — is enough to fire up the slander machine). But of course we’re not fretting about that. What Donald tells Melania is, and should be, the least of our fears. No, this episode underscores what should truly worry us: the sublimated misogyny this campaign is unleashing, and not just in Trump supporters. Huma’s humiliation will once again quickly fade from our consciousness. But I hope the self-scrutiny and unease it’s eliciting in so many women will stick around for a while. We need to remind ourselves that sisterhood is powerful only as long as compassion is. Maybe it will even help us to forge a new archetype. As Kat, my Millennial friend said after further reflection, “I’m just excited to see her grow into her own public person/persona apart from the scandal and her role as the face of ‘grit your teeth stand by your man.’ Smart, capable, beautiful, SINGLE woman as the president’s right hand is such a better story.”",0

The Old English cwen not only could refer to a noble woman or wife of a king, it could refer to any woman or a wife. In Early Middle English, the vowel became more open when queen was used to simply mean a woman, as opposed to the closed vowel when used to refer to the wife of a king.

1444624139503996929,Pretty sure Hillary Clinton is a cuckquean,"Yet here was a couple, and the many couples I have since worked with, who were consensually and deliberately inviting another man into their bed -- to have sex with the wife! They were not in my therapy room because of coercion, or cheating pain. No, they were there because they wanted better strategies to manage cuckolding and what today is called ""hotwifing"". ""Hotwifing,"" literally means ""hot wife sharing"", It is a fetish in which a husband/partner is turned on by watching his hot wife/partner have sex with another man that he has chosen. He chooses a ""bull""––a man who is well endowed, preferably better endowed than he is. Then he becomes the director of the production that he sets up. This production is a result of his sexual erotic orientation. He wants to be cuckolded. He seeks to feel simultaneously deeply humiliated and deeply aroused sexually. He wants to feel like a victim of the man he has invited in, and whom he orchestrates to make love to his woman.",0

Hillary has been accused, harassed, hounded and treated unfairly for (30?) years. She has testified before Congressional committee's for (11?) hours without invoking the 5th. Right wing, dogmatic low intellect people ignorantly believe the lies told about her by disreputable outlets such as Fox & Breitbart. (A side note, Fox is self-admittedly not news, but “entertainment”). She has been accused of murdering people, taking bribes, treason & other horrific crimes. Anyone who is not tied to right-wing dogma can research any or all of these accusations for themselves & discover that they have no basis in truth, reality or legal standing. Republican's have wasted millions of taxpayer dollars running phony 'Hillary Investigations' while letting horrible abuses of the Trump administration slide. Some Republican's who heard Trump call other countries “shith***s” deny this statement by our president because they think he may have said “sh##houses”, not “sh##holes”. If Hillary had ever uttered anything 1% as vulgar there would be no end to the hearings & meetings called by Republican's. And while Republican's continue to try to obfuscate the truth about Russian corruption in our election process & other of our democratic institutions, Trump, his family & supporters continually chant “But Hillary this…!” or “But Obama that…!”.

She was looking into reforming our already limping health care insurance industry and they went nuts on her, taking out ads with Mom and Dad worried about their favorite doctor seeing them, and if he didn’t it would be all Hillary’s fault. She was also our first truly independent First Lady, successful in her position as a lawyer in an old and established law firm. She actually made more than Bill did as governor. So she challenged a good many people, male and female. Her remark about not staying home and serving tea and baking cookies made Republicans screech. Now we hope our daughters don’t stay home making tea and cookies. But for her time she was seen as too feminist, and not ladylike. Now of course we have a First lady who has posed nude with another woman and there has been less attention paid to that than if Hillary baked cookies or not.",0

1444624139503996929,Pretty sure Hillary Clinton is a cuckquean,"Here is a story I read that can be confirmed. Following 911 the president was confronted with a national crisis. How he handled things was going to have a significant impact on our nation at the time and into the future. It was the first crisis of this kind he had ever faced and that any president would have faced. President Bush was giving one of the most important addresses to the country and all the dignitaries and self important people were there. It was a big deal. These big events are governed by protocol when it comes to positioning and sitting people. Well protocol dictates that the order of Presidents is the the last president is higher on protocol list than the second to last. So according to protocol President Clinton was to be sitting next to George W as he was the sitting president. Then next to the Clintons was George H.W. Bush. The Clintons knew the the President was receiving a lot of support from his parents. The Clintons insisted on breaking with protocol so that George and Barbara Bush could sit with their son to provide support during what was the most significant event their son would ever be confronted with. A small gesture that reveals a lot about the Clinton’s awareness and priorities. George W. related that event and also the respect the Clintons showed President H.W. Bush after defeating him in the 1992 election led to the appointment of President Clinton and H.W. to head up the Haiti relief efforts. The Clintons are reportedly now very close to the Bushes, and Bill (according to W.) spends more time with his parents in Maine than anyone else in the family.",0

It only allocated it to states that adopted “truth-in-sentencing” laws that dramatically increased the amount of time criminals served.

She said that “if left unchecked, Saddam Hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare, and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons.” She insisted that there was a risk that, despite the absence of the necessary delivery systems, Saddam Hussein would somehow, according to the 2002 resolution, “employ those weapons to launch a surprise attack against the United States,” which therefore justifies “action by the United States to defend itself” through invading and occupying the country.",0

Instead, Clinton voted for the Republican-sponsored resolution to give President Bush the authority to invade Iraq at the time and circumstances of his own choosing regardless of whether inspectors returned.

Despite warnings by scholars, retired diplomats, and others familiar with the region that a U.S. invasion of Iraq would prove harmful to the United States, she insisted that at U.S.-led takeover of Iraq was “in the best interests of our nation.”",0

Look how she fucked over Libya for example https://t.co/VAC9xdoNvT","Rather than being a misguided overreaction to the 9/11 tragedy driven by the trauma that America had experienced, Clinton’s militaristic stance on Iraq predated her support for Bush’s invasion. For example, in defending her husband President Bill Clinton’s four-day bombing campaign against Iraq in December 1998, she claimed that “the so-called presidential palaces … in reality were huge compounds well suited to hold weapons labs, stocks, and records which Saddam Hussein was required by the UN to turn over. When Saddam blocked the inspection process, the inspectors left.” In reality, there were no weapons labs, stocks of weapons, or missing records in these presidential palaces. In addition, Saddam was still allowing for virtually all inspections to go forward. The inspectors were ordered to depart by her husband a couple days beforehand to avoid being harmed in the incipient bombings. Ironically, in justifying her support for invading Iraq years later, she would claim that it was Saddam who had “thrown out” the UN inspectors. She also bragged that it was during her husband’s administration that the United States “changed its underlying policy toward Iraq from containment to regime change.”",0

The fact remains, that under the past six administrations, a total of 230 diplomats have been murdered during conflicts and no other secretary of state or president has been held responsible for their deaths. There’s a real double standard with HRC on these types of things. Those who hate her demonize her for things others have done, such as the email scandal. In fact, of the last three secretaries of state, she is the only one to voluntarily (or otherwise) turn in her emails. Colin Powell and Condi Rice have received requests and ignored them.

But even if the Trumpites are right, and the academics, the media hacks, the pundits-for-hire and their whole supply train of self-satisfied “progressives” have missed the point, there’s still a big hitch in the notion of a Trump presidency. It’s this: Trump may have identified the problem, but he’s given no evidence whatsoever that he’s the man to solve it. His 75-minute oration at last week’s convention was a testament to that fact; the newly-crowned presidential nominee offered no concrete solutions other than, “Believe me, it will happen and it will happen fast.”",0

You can go back as far as you want: to the destruction of the Roman Republic, leading to 400 years of rule by emperors so powerful they could declare themselves gods, ending in a collapse so all-encompassing it produced 1,000 years of cultural and political darkness; to the overthrow of the despotic, decrepit French monarchy, only to have it replaced by the Terror, the guillotine and ultimately 15 years of Napoleonic wars; or the end to 3,000 years of Chinese emperors and warlords, making way for the brutalities of Mao’s communist regime.",0

One of the final speakers in Cleveland, PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, proclaimed that “it’s time to end the era of stupid wars,” while failing to note it was a Republican president backed by a Republican congress who started the most recent one. The result is on display across the Middle East for all to see. Regime change, which is what Trump is advocating for America, does work on occasion. The establishment of democracies in Germany and Japan following the Second World War are notable examples. But it took years to accomplish, trillions of dollars in support and a military presence that continues to this day. Trump says he’ll have results the day after he takes the oath of office. Doubts about Trump, whether they spring from elitists or otherwise, don’t derive from an inability to understand the problem. They’re based on the belief — based on mountains of evidence — that he lacks the skills, temperament and experience to produce the solution. And they’ll persist until he provides a credible reason to believe otherwise, other than, “Trust me, it’s gonna happen.”",0

A pox on him and his birthday. https://t.co/ZIlXnEYKuk,"Sunday mornings in Plains, Georgia, Mr. Jimmy wakes in his unchanged ranch home with the '70s appliances and same old Formica countertops at the usual hour of 5 A.M., and inevitably scribbles some Bible-lesson notes that he mostly never refers to, and then, after his ablutions and 7 A.M. breakfast with Rosalynn—oatmeal is a favorite—the Secret Service ferries him through town in a black car, past the gas station that was once his brother's, past his old campaign headquarters in a little warehouse, past the home Rosalynn was born in, to Maranatha Baptist Church. The church is the bull's-eye of his stomping grounds—the verdant flatland upon which Plains sits, where he hunts and fishes. He receives vegetables from the farm where he grew up, a few miles outside town, which is now on the National Register of Historic Places. He visits every so often, and there's the old bedroom that belonged to Mr. Jimmy, with a model wooden ship and weathered copy of War and Peace, and there's the dining-room table at which the Carter family—two girls and two boys—sat to eat, or sat to read and eat, as Mr. Jimmy's mother, Lillian, insisted that her children always be reading. And there's the scrubby red-dirt tennis court built by Mr. Jimmy's daddy, Earl, a Sunday-school teacher himself, who employed a wicked slice to always beat his son. About 40 Sundays a year, Mr. Jimmy materializes from thin air, flickering before us at Maranatha to lead Bible study, to say, No, the world's not going to end. Not just yet. Though he's elfin with age, you'd still instantly recognize him as our 39th president: with those same hooded ice-blue eyes, the same rectangular head, the same famous 1,000-watt smile. But when he teaches like this, he transforms from whatever your vision of Jimmy Carter is into someone different, some kind of 93-year-old Yoda-like knower, who in his tenth decade on earth still possesses that rarest of airy commodities: hope. Hope is something that Mr. Jimmy thinks about a lot—and faith, too, from which hope rises in the first place. It's something that you're born with, faith, but also something you must re-apply every day, like a gel or cream. He says first you have faith in your mama, when you're suckling at her breast. And then you have faith in your people: the tight-knit circle of kin and neighbors in your town. Then—your country. He says what might be most important, though, is faith in a creator of some sort. Mr. Jimmy says you can fill in the blank: Muhammad, Buddha, Jesus…Gaia, Martians, T'Challa, king of Wakanda… In front of the congregation—in spring and summer, autumn and winter—he perambulates the green carpet like old people sometimes do, as if on the deck of a ship on a rolling sea. He wears a turquoise bolo, somewhere between groovy and huh? His face is still elastic, the zygomatic muscles reflexively drawing his mouth into that smile, but his voice sometimes turns phlegmy without notice—and he starts coughing. His mind is a churning thing of wonder. His recall is sharp, his barbs of humor unexpected.",0

A pox on him and his birthday. https://t.co/ZIlXnEYKuk,"The answer: Learn to get along with each other in a peaceful way, to accommodate our human differences. “Would you agree with that?” asks Mr. Jimmy. Peace and difference, together. Unless you can imagine it, he says, the human race is probably kaput. A few years back, it appeared as if Mr. Jimmy was kaput, too, when the doctors found cancer on his liver and four tumors on his brain. At the time, he thought he only had weeks left and was filled not with sorrow, really, but great equanimity. Somehow, with treatment, he lived. Does anyone dare ask why? While Mr. Jimmy is still flickering, there are those who want to bask in the last of what he represents—a lost democratic tradition, civil discourse, moral rectitude—that lights a way out of this present-day mess. Is it possible to escape? That's why we come to Mr. Jimmy now: to find out. If one were to judge by the sustained Sunday crowds, Maranatha Baptist Church has turned into an unlikely American pilgrimage site. Perhaps we're afflicted by a deeper national need, or lack, the kind that inspires searchers to travel hundreds, sometimes thousands, of miles and begin lining up in the dark, but it raises a bunch of personal and collective questions. After all, soul-searching is a by-product of having temporarily lost one's soul. On one of my Sunday visits, last November, I arrived around 4:30 A.M. and was handed a scrap of paper with the number 15 scrawled on it, meaning I was 15th in line. The man doing the handing out was named George, dressed in blue slacks and a checked shirt with a red ball cap on his head. He said that some Sundays, if you're not there four or five hours ahead of time, you don't get in. The Sunday after Mr. Jimmy announced he had cancer, in August 2015, 1,800 people came to Plains, beginning to queue on Saturday night. (The highway patrol shut down the road out front; Mr. Jimmy did two lessons, one in a nearby auditorium, and still they turned people away.) Today, George had arrived at his usual time, around 4 A.M., to find a young man—twitchy, half-awake, and chilled—in a suit, no tie, white shirt, standing out there on the front porch of the church in the dark, here to see Mr. Jimmy before it's too late. Everything at that hour seemed special in Plains to someone coming from the North, as I had. George's honeyed drawl, for one. And the silence was special, in the hour when the Muscogee ghosts give up night on the southern coastal plain, and everything is deep and still. George had his eye on the special sky now, scanning the canopy of stars. “Last week we saw it three times,” he said. “We won't see it again for about ten days.” He was talking about the International Space Station, which you could track with an app on your phone. On his phone, too, George showed some pictures of yesterday's fishing trip with Mr. Jimmy. No artifice, no braggadocio: just another fishing trip with Mr. Jimmy—who you can almost forget is ex-president of the United States down here—to add to the others.",0

A pox on him and his birthday. https://t.co/ZIlXnEYKuk,"But still, it was crystal-clear: The people of Plains were proud of the celebrity Mr. Jimmy had bestowed on their little town. And the occasional luminaries he brought, too: Menachem Begin had been here, and Anwar Sadat. When Yasser Arafat visited, the mayor gave him a key to the city, and Arafat kissed him on both cheeks. (“I don't think our mayor has ever gotten over the kiss,” says Mr. Jimmy.) When the president of Bolivia came, the delegation played soccer with a local high school team. According to Mr. Jimmy, Christina Aguilera was supposed to come, but there was a travel snafu. (“I'm disappointed her plane didn't get in,” he says.) Putin hasn't made it yet, either, but Mr. Jimmy has his personal e-mail. They like to fish the same stream in Russia. Somewhere around 6 A.M., more cars began to sluice into the parking lot for Mr. Jimmy's 10 A.M. class. George greeted each new arrival with a slightly crumpled numbered piece of paper. In came Wilmington, North Carolina. In came Seattle, Washington. In came Pennsylvania and Virginia and Jamaica. George told them that the line would form outside the church at 7:45 A.M., that the Secret Service would do its scannings and checks, and that Miss Jan, his wife, would give a briefing at 9 A.M. The lot filled, the sun rose, sky was a mottle of clouds and blue nitrogen. The young man in the suit paced on the porch. People got out of their cars and stretched, walked down the highway to a big smiling-peanut statue in front of a convenience store, where they could get some Styrofoam-cup coffee. Others loitered on the lawn. One guy, a farmer from Pennsylvania, said, “A lot of people said, ‘You're coming down here to go to church?’ I said, ‘Yeah. I'm coming down to hear a former U.S. president talk about something that's important to him in a group of about 300 people and then stick around for pictures afterwards.’ ” A woman from Oregon said, “This couple here”—referring to Mr. Jimmy and his wife, Rosalynn—“are probably the closest couple of people that you'll find that walks the walk of the disciples. That's incredible in this day and age, this modern age. What they've done, what they do, it's incredible.” “It smacks you in the face how polar opposite the current [president] is,” said another. “It just jumps out at you and says, ‘This is how it's supposed to be.’ ” “I have a fairly good friend in the White House,” Mr. Jimmy said, then deadpanned, “Just one. I have to admit, it’s not the president.” The twitchy kid in the suit said he was going to college in Washington, D.C. He took the last flight of the day to Atlanta, then Ubered two and a half hours to Plains and started waiting at 3 A.M. “I thought it'd be cool,” he said. And the ride only cost about $150, much less than he'd expected. Some visitors confessed that this had always been on their bucket list, and, well, who knew how much longer Mr. Jimmy would be around? 1 At first, I was a bit afraid to admit I wasn't necessarily here to get closer to Jesus but, feeling bereft at the country we've become, had come looking for uplift. George told us that the Carters recently had a hill across the road from their house landscaped, marked for their eventual grave sites. Everyone shook their heads solemnly, not wanting to imagine it. Later, inside the church, Miss Jan greeted the gathered pilgrims. She was a short, commanding, wisecracking woman with a sassafras shrub of gray hair. She'd once lived in Washington, acting as “governess” for the youngest of the Carters' four children, Amy, who now, at 50, has two sons of her own and is a classroom aide at a school in Atlanta. Miss Jan told us how happy she was to see us and that we were not to “get cute” when Mr. Jimmy came in. “Some of you are going to stop breathing, almost,” she said. “So amazed that this man is here.”",0
1443980868155056151,Jimmy Carter is a disgusting Jew hater. A pox on him and his birthday. https://t.co/ZIlXnEYKuk,"Our America, as summed up recently by The New York Times, is a place where “life expectancy has declined, suicide rates have risen, the opioid crisis has worsened, inequality has grown, and confidence in government has fallen.” But our democracy has survived ragged, if not broken, times before. In 1971 the Times asked in a headline, IS AMERICA FALLING APART? Then put a fine point on it: “America is a prewar country, psychologically unprepared for one thing to go wrong,” wrote Anthony Burgess. “Now everything [seems] to be going wrong. Hence the neurosis, despair, the Kafka feeling that the whole marvelous fabric of American life is coming apart at the seams.” If we were fully unraveling in 1971, what was 1974, then? What were 1776 and 1862? We were coming apart at the seams in 1929 and 1942, 1963 and 2001. It's possible we've been coming apart since our inception. Perhaps it's a shortcoming of our American imagination, or national narcolepsy—and part of our volcanic creation story, too—to believe that this moment, right now, may be the worst moment ever, over and over and over again. If we forget other dysfunctional presidents, from John Quincy Adams and John Tyler to LBJ and Nixon, we might believe that this president is the most irrational, unstable, and narcissistic of all. The potential split atom of our democracy forever threatens to be our annihilation. But it doesn't mitigate these times to say there have been times like them before. It only begs the question: To whom might we appeal, or where might we find not just a voice of reason but one to remind us that—despite division and gun violence, deep-seated issues of race and class—the experiment is still worthy and vital? “Do I have any kinfolk here today?” he asked. A man raised his hand. “You a kin to me? We’ll have to fish together.” Perhaps this is why people come to Plains. Because to gaze upon Jimmy Carter, to look upon a face marked by time—the charismatic handsomeness of his 50s has softened, hollowed, and transformed into the weatherworn visage of his 90s—is to see someone shorn of ambition, trying to tell a truth, or his truth. Somewhere inside the man we knew as president, there's always been Mr. Jimmy, the seeker, who over time grew in concentration, no longer caring for our approval but, in a weird way, for the state of our national soul. If he was once criticized as a politician for being egomaniacal or sanctimonious, it's easier, with his presidency in the deep past, to accept Jimmy Carter as a human being whose heart might have always been in the right place. In church, teaching from the Bible, Mr. Jimmy becomes to his followers the purest distillation, then, of some post-presidency ideal, some secular saint. On the hallway bulletin board are pinned pictures of community events, the Carters beaming with locals. The butterfly garden out back was built by Rosalynn. And at these Sunday-school meetings, her husband steadies our twitchiness in singsong tones, with a personal psalm of history, Bible study, current events, and autobiography. “There's no way to separate completely the responsibilities of public service and also some basic moral and ethical principles on which we base the finest aspects of our life,” Mr. Jimmy says, “and we cure the problems in our society.” He likes to quote a favorite theologian, Reinhold Niebuhr, who said, “The sad duty of politics is to establish justice in a sinful world.” Carter says, for better or worse, he tried. In the Oval Office every morning before beginning his day's work, he would stand before the huge globe situated by the Resolute desk and touch his finger on Moscow, trying to put himself in Brezhnev's shoes. He would think: How can I not provoke him today?",0

A pox on him and his birthday. https://t.co/ZIlXnEYKuk,"“We never shot a bullet, we never dropped a bomb, we never launched a missile,” says Mr. Jimmy of his time in office. It's a fact he's proud of, especially given that since World War II, America's been at war with about 20 countries. China, on the other hand, hasn't been in a major war since 1979. “What they have done is to use their enormous resources to benefit their own people,” he says. “China has 14,000 miles of fast-speed rail.” Look at the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, he tells us one Sunday morning: “Thirty little, tiny paragraphs that you can read over in five minutes.… A lot of them are not being honored by our country in particular.… That's why we have wars today. All of those 30 paragraphs guarantee that women and men should have equal pay and equal opportunity for advancement and equal rights.… We have a long way to go.” If we as a nation suffer from thin-skinned righteousness, or ideological arrogance, he says he himself has suffered the sins of pride, thinking himself superior at times—to women, to those of different background. He's not proud of this in the least, but he has the courage to admit it. “Who decided whether you'd be kind or filled with hatred?” he asks on another morning. “Who decided whether you would forgive other people or not? Who decided whether you'd be honest and tell the truth or not? Who decided whether you would be generous or not? Who decided whether you'd be filled with love or not?” Then he answers his own questions: “Every one of us,” says Mr. Jimmy, “has our own free decision to answer the question This is the kind of person I'm going to be. It's not a decision that your parents can make for you, or your wife can make for you, or your husband or your friends. Everybody in here has the right to decide This is the kind of person I'm going to be. And if you haven't been the kind of person that you are proud of so far, you're free from now on the rest of your life to correct your mistakes.” He loves to quote his schoolteacher Miss Julia, who oft repeated, “We must accommodate changing times but cling to unchanging principles.” It's true of us in our private lives and true in public lives. It's true, too, when we think about the life of our town or state or nation. This is how it begins, actually, today. With this goodness, change, and hope, of which Mr. Jimmy speaks. He loves to quote his schoolteacher Miss Julia, who oft repeated, “We must accommodate changing times but cling to unchanging principles.” Mr. Jimmy asks for people to characterize in a word this moment we live in, under this president. “Confused,” someone shouts. “Twitter,” yells another. Divided, angry, crazy… Once the floodgate opens, people can't stop—reactionary, frightening, embarrassing…—but Mr. Jimmy eventually brings it to a shush. “How many of you have faith that our country can survive this despicable situation and come out okay?” There's a caesura, and then all the hands in the congregation go up. It surprises and overwhelms even Mr. Jimmy a little. “If you don't mind,” he says, “I'm going to put that in my book.” An American apotheosis is often built on a humbling downfall, and Jimmy Carter has his, too, of course. He came to the presidency as one of the longest long shots in history: With only 2 percent name recognition when he began his primary run, he eventually won 50.1 percent of the national vote to defeat incumbent Gerald Ford. After four tumultuous years, he found himself as widely disliked as almost any president in history. His 34 percent approval rating upon exit was the same as George W. Bush's, according to Gallup; the only modern presidents more hated were Nixon and Truman.",0
1443980868155056151,Jimmy Carter is a disgusting Jew hater. A pox on him and his birthday. https://t.co/ZIlXnEYKuk,"In Carter's case, despite the triumph of a Middle East peace agreement and the normalization of relations with China, despite his claim of having the second-highest success rate of initiatives passed in Congress (LBJ was the first), he was blamed for crippling stagflation, a fuel crisis that led to epic gas-station lines, and a kind of Black Mirror episode in which a grumpy Iranian imam halfway around the world seemed to hold not just 52 Americans but an entire nation, including its president, hostage. Carter so worried over the hostages in Iran that he proclaimed they were the first thing he thought about in the morning when he woke and the last thing he thought about at night during the 444 days of their captivity. To make matters worse, a failed rescue attempt left eight American servicemen dead in the Iranian desert.2 The Carter presidency (1977 to 1981) is partially remembered—and lampooned—for this very afterimage of ineffectuality, of a leaf man lost in the forest with a command for minute details but whose overweening morality eventually left him without political bite or guile. His religiosity also confused people. As the first president from a southern, evangelical-Christian tradition to talk about being “born again,” he was, according to E. J. Dionne Jr., treated by the press as “some sort of Martian.”3 Surrounded by his “Georgia Mafia,” the group of advisers who'd helped make him governor of that state, Carter rode into Washington on a populist wave, as an outsider—and remained one. He took a dim view of Congress, at one point calling the members “juvenile delinquents.” A claim that came to define Carter's microscopy was that, given all the crises in the world, the president himself controlled the sign-up sheet for the White House tennis court. (Carter eventually had to deny the detail.4) The toothy smile, the oversharing,5 Billy the beer-swilling brother, and a crazed swamp rabbit that seemed to muster an attack on the president as he fished—they all made for good punch lines. Though the true Carter was much more complicated, a combination, as described by historian Garry Wills, of “ferocious tenderness, the detached intimacy, the cooing which nonetheless suggests a proximity of lions.” His mean streak included an intense dislike for Ted Kennedy, blaming the senator for denying him a comprehensive health-care bill. In retrospect, there's much about the Carter presidency that was shaped by externalities—in particular the Iranian revolution that was at the root of both the second oil crisis and the hostage-taking in 1979—and yet Carter's response to both, epitomized in his famous “Crisis of Confidence” speech on July 15 of that year, was a withering sort of critique. In that address, he famously condemned our American addiction to stuff, our materialism and consumerism. “Too many of us now tend to worship self-indulgence and consumption,” he told us. He called for car pools, thermostats set lower, and obeyance of the speed limit not just as acts of common sense but of patriotism. To watch that speech now is to witness a very unusual sort of political mixing of morality, religion, and country frugality. (It seems telling that people misremember the speech as having been delivered in a cardigan sweater, rather than the suit and tie Carter wore.) Afterward, the White House switchboard lit up, allegedly with callers applauding the president. And yet judging by the reaction to that speech over time—including the election of Ronald Reagan—apparently what we craved was a different kind of bedtime story to solve our problems, not Carter's strict-daddy austerity measures, ones that included solar panels on the White House. And yet the polls were still even on the Friday before Election Day, 1980; only in the waning moments of the campaign did Reagan's brand provide the more powerful elixir. You can watch the aftermath on YouTube: Carter leaving Washington on Inauguration Day and flying back to Plains with Rosalynn, emerging in cold January rain to huge crowds. Here he is, then: 56 years old, and in the footage he sees his mother, Lillian, to whom he confesses he hasn't slept in two nights, in a flurry of last-minute negotiations to free the hostages. He is home, among his friends and family, and yet there's an air of exhaustion and melancholy. (“Allowing Ronald Reagan to become president,” he said later, “was by far my biggest failure in office.”) Prior to the presidency, he'd owned a prosperous peanut business, but due to mismanagement, he's recently found out he's over $1 million in debt. Not the most auspicious start to a post-presidency. At the time, America was mostly done with Jimmy Carter. We apparently were unconvinced by his wagging finger, by his stubbornness, by his inability to effectively address the big challenges of the day. Our stature in the world seemed much diminished. He himself talks about his former “arrogance,” that he thought he possessed all the answers somehow. But we kept waiting for Godot to show up—and when he didn't, we turned the page with some disgust. Ronald Reagan brought his California movie-star wattage and conservative duende, and, like that, after a four-year interlude from the Nixonian nadir, the Republican party was seemingly resurrected and would run the table for the next 12 years. Carter's last significant cameo was a visit with the released hostages in Germany at Reagan's behest, one that left him moved and shaken. Then he retreated to write his memoirs from the 5,000 diary pages he'd kept during his White House years, and to pay back his debts. As summer gave way to fall in Plains, and fall to winter, as winter relented to spring and the plums, figs, and sugarberries came back around, the cars kept pulling into the lot at Maranatha Baptist, greeted by George, who kept one eye on the heavens, looking for the Space Station. Back in February, Rosalynn took ill—“very, very ill” was how Mr. Jimmy had it. It had to do with her “insides,” repercussions from an operation years ago, and required another operation, from which recovery was slow and arduous. Mr. Jimmy was going up to Atlanta twice a week to see her and abide with her and spend the night. Even he seemed a little more wobbly on his feet now, even more elfin with age. Sometimes Miss Jan set up a chair nearby that he never used, or a glass of water. He appeared from the wings at 10 A.M. each Sunday, flashing that disarming smile, and those hooded ice-blue eyes, the full effect of which, when he registers surprise or joy, was startling, almost boyish. He spread the notes he never referred to on the podium, saying, “Good morning, everyone!” Beaming back at him were Connecticut and Arizona, a family from England, scatterlings from Taiwan, Japan, Scotland, Congo. “Do I have any kinfolk here today?” he asked. A man raised his hand. “You a kin to me? We'll have to fish together.” Then he was off again, musing about those statues of Confederate war heroes, whether they should be torn down: “When I see a statue of a soldier from the Confederate side, I feel like I might admire it because it might represent my grandparents.” Or sounding a little like Bernie Sanders, repeating beliefs he's held long before we bothered listening to Bernie Sanders. “Today if you can't raise $200 million, you can't be the nominee,” he said, “and it costs $1 billion by the two candidates once they get done running. We've become an oligarchy ruled by wealth rather than a true democracy.” On a Sunday before Christmas, he claimed he'd just been on his last quail hunt. He was down in Leesburg with friends and noticed, while walking through the woods, that his balance was off. Rather than endanger anyone, he knew his shooting days were over. “I had to give up running when I was 80 years old, so age catches up with everybody,” he said. When did Jimmy Carter forgive us? The answer to that was simple: The first day Mr. Jimmy, a citizen again, invited us all back to Plains, Georgia, for Sunday school, the day his ex-presidency began in earnest. In March, he reminded us that he was cancer-free. Maybe he could go on forever. So much was happening so quickly now: North Korea, Syria, Iran, Russian meddling, trade wars and porn stars, stock-market roller coaster, etc. He'd been in Egypt and met with the grand imam. He'd huddled with a White House official to brief him on the North Korea situation. (“I have a fairly good friend in the White House,” he said, then deadpanned, “Just one. I have to admit, it's not the president.”) He'd recently sent a message to Putin, telling him that with the help of Google they'd constructed a “map of belligerence in Syria.” He wondered if Putin himself would be “interested in having it so he would bomb the right people.” Here we were, then, humans evolved to a high point, an apex, trying to kill each other, both figuratively and literally. To inoculate myself, I'd tried to boycott the news, but then couldn't. It seemed to boil down to a peculiar choice at this moment, between being apoplectic or apathetic. Was there a medical diagnosis for the national diminishment of hope? And on Sunday, Mr. Jimmy stood up in front of the world as it arrived to Plains—speaking before some sort of unspoken resistance movement—and calmly kept right on teaching his lessons. On the last Sunday I was in the crowd, Mr. Jimmy was talking about Tolstoy's War and Peace. He was wondering if any of us had read it, and an uncertain hand or two went up. “It's about ordinary people,” Mr. Jimmy said with a flash of excitement. “The message I got from it was that even in Russia, that was controlled by an emperor, it was the common, ordinary people that shaped the outcome of the major historical events. And if that's true in a country that's had an emperor, who was a dictator, it must be true in our country. You see, that's the transition that I want us to make this morning. We, individual citizens [in] a democracy, we are the ones that determine what kind of country we have.”",0

A pox on him and his birthday. https://t.co/ZIlXnEYKuk,"Afterward, at the nearby cafeteria, a fellow attendee—California—asked a group of us, “When did you forgive Jimmy Carter?” I understood the gist of the question—when did the failures of his presidency resolve into a higher regard for this citizen sainthood of his, if that's what it is? But it seemed reverse to me. I was thinking about that Friday before the 1980 election, when the polls showed Carter and Reagan in a dead heat. We voted for the bedtime story, then, eight years, plus four more under Bush, that led to deeper class and race divides, to the rich getting much richer while the poor got much poorer. To me, the more accurate question might have been: When did Jimmy Carter forgive us? And the answer to that was simple: The first day Mr. Jimmy, a citizen again, invited us all back to Plains, Georgia, for Sunday school, the day his ex-presidency began in earnest. Four decades later, Mr. Jimmy was still flickering: He mowed the lawn at the church, and weeded, and because he favors woodworking, Mr. Jimmy has made the cross that hangs in the sanctuary, and the collection plates, and a table. Here was a man of peace, who was betting on the long arc of history, for us to be saved from ourselves again. If a president embodies a certain aspect of our country in any given moment, then you could look back and see now that Mr. Jimmy was the goodness of what we could be, the betterment. If he'd come to the presidency as a public servant, he was going to die one, too. His most important speeches were now given at 10 A.M., at Maranatha Baptist Church, and those lined no one's pockets. Maybe the example Mr. Jimmy had set, in retrospect, is that the presidency itself isn't a brand, after all. And that he wasn't an accident of history, either, wasn't just a four-year pendulum swing away from Nixon. Perhaps he'd been sent to carry his own message, campaigning for an idea that the greatest strength lies in humbling ourselves before one another. Peace and difference, together. His personal life is in shambles, Robert Mueller looms large, and it's never been trickier to be the president's son. When it came time to hire Brandon, the 24-year-old pastor, Mr. Jimmy sat with everyone else from church at a long table in the cafeteria and, over fried chicken, collard greens, and sweet tea, asked questions and listened. They hired Brandon, and the young pastor still remembers a small moment that says everything, he thinks. It was a Sunday night back at the church recently, after the morning's Sunday-school teaching by Mr. Jimmy, and the service, and lunch, after another afternoon and evening event. It was 8 P.M., and only a few people were left at Maranatha, when all of a sudden the Secret Service swooped in. Out of a black car popped Mr. Jimmy, one arm in a sling from a minor mishap, clutching a hammer. “President Carter,” said Brandon, “what are you doing?” “The door needs fixing,” said Mr. Jimmy, smiling. He gamboled over, did some pounding and hammering, made a fair bit of noise. Then he turned and teetered across the yard. As quickly as he'd materialized, he was gone, in a black car carrying him back along the familiar streets of Plains, back to Rosalynn and the same old appliances and Formica countertops of home.

Jackson, now President, forced a law through Congress which essentially set aside the treaties the U. S. government and states had signed with the Cherokees (and four other native American tribes).

I, therefore, believe Jackson was the worst president this country has ever had.

In it, Brooks responds to PolitFact’s pants-on-fire debunking of the video hoax, which singled out Politics WatchDog. “I'm one of the admins for the page,” he wrote. “I did not post the video.

But the plattform refuses to remove the video, despite harsh words from critics, including Pelosi. “I think they have proven —by not taking down something they know is false—that they were willing enablers of the Russian interference in our election,” Pelosi said in a radio interview Wednesday.",0

1443947350989230091,Nancy Pelosi is an EVIL BITCH!!!!!,"A few weeks ago, on a Thursday around noon, Nancy Pelosi whirls through the second floor of the Capitol in a sea-foam pantsuit with lots of gold jangling on her arms. The Speaker of the House, the highest-ranking woman in government and third in line to the president, is about to walk the pink-painted halls of her private chambers to another series of closed-door meetings with the Democratic caucus about the health-care bill. Today, she’s set up a powwow of progressives in one of her conference rooms, and another for the Blue Dogs down the hall, but first she has some smiling to do. The Nancy Pelosi smile, as you may have noticed, is a thing to behold, mostly released in conjunction with serial spasms of eye-widening, an odd tic that is likely meant to connote sincerity and optimism (wide-eyedness and all that). Her smile, too, is very big and very quick, coming out of almost nowhere like the Cheshire Cat’s, then disappearing without a trace, often replaced by a wholly unnecessary grimace, a look of vast disappointment at some slight, threat, or sign of disrespect—either real or imagined.",0
1443947350989230091,Nancy Pelosi is an EVIL BITCH!!!!!,"Smiling, then, is what she does as she whips into the Capitol’s 180-foot Rotunda dome that abuts her office, where a hundred or so nervous high-school pages in ill-fitting blue blazers and gray slacks shuffle their feet under a painting of the surrender of General Burgoyne, waiting for her to catapult into the center of a ceremonial photo. Next, she beelines for her office balcony, the one with a killer view straight down the National Mall to the Washington Monument, where she joins her college interns for another portrait, chatting with each about his hometown: “Puerto Rico? My college roommate was from there! My husband and I went on our honeymoon there!” For the most part, they’re from California, where Pelosi, 69, began to make her home 40 years ago, after a stint in Manhattan and a childhood in Baltimore as the daughter of the mayor. “You’re the one who lives next to Phil,” she squeals, talking to a skinny blonde. “Oh my God, is his houseboat something! I’ve been there—both before and after it sank.”",0
1443947350989230091,Nancy Pelosi is an EVIL BITCH!!!!!,"Then she’s on the House floor, banging the gavel in a monthly moment of silence for the armed forces before making her way out, squeezing shoulders here and there, whispering in a few ears. “Speakers in the past tended to be untouchable people, but Nancy Pelosi is around,” says José Serrano, a congressman from the Bronx. “She’s not hiding. If you disagree with her, she’s there for you to disagree with.” He guffaws a little. “Of course, she doesn’t come around to talk to you about sports or the weather. She’s trying to get something she wants.”",0
1443947350989230091,Nancy Pelosi is an EVIL BITCH!!!!!,"She’s rounding a bend, low green heels tapping away, when, suddenly, a gaggle of nuns appears. Apparently, the U.N. decreed a couple years ago that today is the International Day of Non-Violence, and these tiny women from Mother Teresa’s order, peering out from under white habits with blue trim, want to wish the Speaker “happy peace.”",0
1443947350989230091,Nancy Pelosi is an EVIL BITCH!!!!!,"The House chaplain, Daniel P. Coughlin, steps forward to make introductions. “I told the sisters you are a good Catholic from the Catholic state of Maryland,” he booms, turning to Pelosi.",0
1443947350989230091,Nancy Pelosi is an EVIL BITCH!!!!!,"The smile gets very, very wide. “Oh, yes,” she says, clasping her hands together. “Let me say, I had the joy of hearing Mother Teresa speak in San Francisco at a cathedral. And she sounded like an angel from Heaven—so beautiful. It was very thrilling for all of us.”",0
1443947350989230091,Nancy Pelosi is an EVIL BITCH!!!!!,"“Thank you,” says Pelosi, releasing another smile—but then her lips turn down and there’s a flash of slight contempt, as she thinks, perhaps, of the people who stand in the way of peace, and fairness, and all that is good in the world. “Sisters, please pray for us,” she says, eyes widening to the size of over-easy eggs. “Pray for us to do the right thing!”",0
1443947350989230091,Nancy Pelosi is an EVIL BITCH!!!!!,"The way that Pelosi always thinks she knows the right thing to do can be very annoying to a lot of people. To conservatives, she’s the devil: “Mussolini in a skirt,” “Nancy Botox,” a “domestic enemy of the Constitution.” In August, when she and Majority Leader Steny Hoyer wrote a USA Today editorial calling town-hall shouters “un-American” for stifling national debate, a radio host said he’d like to punch her in the face; Joe the Plumber wanted to “beat the living tar” out of her; and Glenn Beck brought out a cardboard cutout of her likeness, then pretended to drink wine alongside it: “I wanted to thank you for having me over here in wine country,” he cackled. “By the way, I put poison in your—no, I look forward to all the policy discussions we’re supposed to have. You know, on health care, energy reform, and the economy. Hey, is that Sean Penn over there?” She’s a high-handed lady who needs to be “put … in her place,” as the National Republican Congressional Committee said when she questioned General McChrystal’s advice on Afghanistan. “It’s really sad. They really don’t understand how inappropriate that is,” Pelosi shot back, smirking a little and trailing a hand in the air. “That language is something I haven’t even heard in decades.”",0
1443947350989230091,Nancy Pelosi is an EVIL BITCH!!!!!,"There’s a knee-jerk aspect to much of the criticism of Pelosi, of course, because she is the most powerful woman in U.S. political history—and we know what the problem is with that. But even to liberals, Pelosi can come across as shrill, strident, too rich. Humorless, odd, tone-deaf. She’s a kind of Queen of Hearts from Alice in Wonderland, imperious with her power and relishing her ability to attack, dropping bombs like “If people are ripping your face off, you have to rip their faces off.” She’s a talking-points machine, who is by the way not above compromising on principle to protect the old boys, like Charlie Rangel, a castrating San Franciscan shrew who banned smoking in some communal areas of the House and makes everyone in congressional cafeterias eat with biodegradable utensils. It does seem like the more we see of her, the less we like her. Pelosi’s national numbers have begun a queasy drop of some ten to fifteen points, and two weeks ago, a poll of Californians put her approval rating at 34 percent, down from 48 percent in March.",0
1443947350989230091,Nancy Pelosi is an EVIL BITCH!!!!!,"All of which might inspire some worry in a person who was paying attention. But Pelosi, pretty much, isn’t. She doesn’t often watch cable news or follow blogs, and her cell phone of choice is a Motorola Razr. She definitely isn’t watching Fox, and can’t really tell Sean Hannity apart from the other anchors. For the most part, Pelosi is in a bubble, where much of what passes for politics doesn’t penetrate. Her face, the one with the frozen smile, is her mask. She often seems unaware of how it looks. For her, the world consists of her members, her donors, and her family, plus President Obama and Rahm Emanuel, whom she sometimes speaks to several times a day. As far as she’s concerned, anything else, and that includes the press, is a petty distraction from her “historic work,” as she likes to say, before ticking off the accomplishments of Congress on her watch over the last two and a half years: the passage of large increases in college aid and veterans’ health care, raising fuel-efficiency standards and the minimum wage, and ethics reform, not to mention the stimulus, bailout, and a climate-change bill that she masterfully shepherded through the House—where it passed by a margin of one vote.",0
1443947350989230091,Nancy Pelosi is an EVIL BITCH!!!!!,"And then of course there’s health care. Before she unveiled her $894 billion bill last week, she and her liberal allies were playing a game of chicken with the public option—“the robust public option,” in the jargon—for months. The base, the bloggers, the Obamaniacs who have lately been losing a little faith in their hero, wanted their due, having been rolled by the moderates over and over, at least that’s how they felt. The robust public option was not only a policy but a kind of battle flag, and Pelosi was the one carrying it, saying just what they wanted to hear. “A trigger is an excuse for not doing anything,” she said, dismissing out of hand the vaunted Olympia Snowe proposal, and breathed fire at the insurance companies: “It’s almost immoral, what they are doing,” she said. “They are the villains in this.”",0
1443947350989230091,Nancy Pelosi is an EVIL BITCH!!!!!,"But Pelosi has got a House to run, and her progressive friends were not the only ones who had to be taken care of. Out of sight, politics in the House was much squishier, and Pelosi was trying to tell everyone what they wanted to hear while counting votes, which she does with precision. The president was nowhere to be found; “It’s like waiting for Godot over here,” says Representative Anthony Weiner.",0
1443947350989230091,Nancy Pelosi is an EVIL BITCH!!!!!,"The face the public saw was that cartoon liberal—but in the bubble, the story is a little different. Privately, she was getting frustrated with the progressives and their whining and carping. “There they are, posing for holy pictures,” she likes to say. “Oh, they want to be sainted.” Noble aims are one thing, but this goop is quite another. To her, you can stand in the gallery and have a media moment. Or you can come into her office and pass this legislation.",0
1443947350989230091,Nancy Pelosi is an EVIL BITCH!!!!!,"Some of this internal struggle became visible when Harry Reid, after acting milquetoasty all summer, decided that the Senate’s public option should include an opt-out provision for states that, by the standards of the Senate, was robust indeed. Suddenly, Pelosi’s unruly flock became the story, and it became clear how tough it was to be in charge. She’d called an emergency vote count on the robust public option—never a good sign—but the results were inconclusive. She looked, truth be told, a little weak, which, being the first woman in her position, is not her preferred method of presentation. But she’ll do anything to win, and weakness, in this case, might have been good politics. The bill she came out with last week was less robust by a long shot than the one she’d been shilling for all year—but it keeps her moderates and freshmen happy for another day, and still may be the camel’s nose under the tent for a single-payer system (which is, of course, what Pelosi supports: “I’ve been for single payer for 30 years,” she tells me, “and back then we were with signs in the street and all that”). And she’d given the progressives as much as she could, which was commitment almost to the finish line.",0
1443947350989230091,Nancy Pelosi is an EVIL BITCH!!!!!,"In any case, this compromise may have been the plan all along. “There could be a larger Kabuki dance going on here between Reid and Nancy,” says a Democratic congressman. “Nancy staked out the strong public-option position, knowing in advance that Reid would come in her direction, and once she saw his light at the end of the tunnel, she moved closer to him.”",0
1443947350989230091,Nancy Pelosi is an EVIL BITCH!!!!!,"Pelosi’s bill will get diluted later in conference, and who knows how reform might actually play out. As a health-care CEO put it to me, “the only thing that keeps an oncologist out of a patient’s coffin is nails.” But national health care, even a watered-down version—what a legacy.",0
1443947350989230091,Nancy Pelosi is an EVIL BITCH!!!!!,"“Not so fast on that, on the legacy,” says Pelosi, taking a seat in a cream-colored chair in her beautiful office, sun pouring into the room from a high narrow window. She breaks into one of her grins. “I said to Al Gore one time, ‘Your work here will be part of your legacy,’ and he said, ‘Um, is there a message here?’ ” Then the smile is gone, and she begins to frown: Pelosi dislikes the perception of hogging credit, and has even decreed that her staff not use the word I when writing for her. “No,” she says. “This is about the health of our country, diet, the way we live, pursuing a more wholesome path. It’s personal. It’s economic. Imagine what would happen if you could have any job you wanted without worrying about needing health care.” She pauses. “And it won’t be my legacy. It will be everyone’s legacy.” She gives a tight smile. “I don’t even think in terms of legacy.” The eyes pop. “I mean, what?”",0
1443947350989230091,Nancy Pelosi is an EVIL BITCH!!!!!,"Suddenly, a door opens, and a beaming servant zooms to Pelosi’s side, stooping to show her the contents of his platter: a delicate bowl, piled high with two luscious scoops of dark-chocolate ice cream.",0
1443947350989230091,Nancy Pelosi is an EVIL BITCH!!!!!,"She lets out something you’ve never heard from her before, at least not on TV: a tremendously long and high-pitched giggle, like one that would come from a girl about a half-century younger. “Hee-hee-hee-hee,” she goes, pushing her chin to the sky. “Oh, no, Michael,” she says, “I don’t want that now. Later, later!”",0
1443947350989230091,Nancy Pelosi is an EVIL BITCH!!!!!,"Chocolate ice cream is the staple of Pelosi’s diet: She doesn’t cook herself, so except for a salad for lunch and whatever an aide hands her for dinner, that’s what she eats. “I think that’s the first time she’s ever turned it down,” whispers her personal assistant, later. “The other day, she came in at 8:45 a.m. carrying a pint of Häagen-Dazs with an inch left in it—she’d eaten the whole thing on the way in. She handed it off to Michael, and then two hours later, she said, ‘Where’s that ice cream? Can I eat the rest of that?’ ” (At one point, when she mentions to me that she likes artisanal ice cream, I joke, “Oh, elitist ice cream,” and she shoots back: “It’s not elite. It’s not elite. It’s just a small operation.”)",0
1443947350989230091,Nancy Pelosi is an EVIL BITCH!!!!!,"Apparently, this is a serious energy booster, because Pelosi maintains a breakneck schedule, turning in at midnight and rising six hours later. She’s been doing that since she became minority whip in 2001, and even earlier, in the seventies, when she had to get up before her kids to read the New York Times. She takes the stairs in the Capitol, never the elevator, with her security huffing and puffing behind. She doesn’t curse, drink, or smoke. She does the Times crossword puzzle for a couple of hours to get a buzz. When she’s starting to get tired, she calls her grandkids, spending twenty minutes on the phone with a 3-year-old, cooing away in a preverbal trance. “That’s her power nap,” says her assistant.",0
1443947350989230091,Nancy Pelosi is an EVIL BITCH!!!!!,"Unlike in the Senate, the majority rules absolutely in the House, and that suits Pelosi. She may not want to be a queen—when members of the Black Caucus called her that once, she said, with typical regal flourish, “I am not an emperor or a queen, but neither am I a fool”—but in reality, the House is hers to rule. If Pelosi wants to put a member on Ways and Means, she just makes the committee bigger. If a member is upset, she can give him a big office budget. If he’s still not happy and she knows he has an interest in NATO, she can prioritize his access to an airplane and off he goes. This has let her create a leadership style that’s less stick and more carrot. She maintains goodwill by feminine touches like presents of flowers, weekly meetings with freshmen, thank-you notes, calls to associates’ sick family members. “Nancy has a minister’s political skills,” says Majority Whip James Clyburn. “She looks for common ground, seeing and feeling things that most people don’t.”",0
1443947350989230091,Nancy Pelosi is an EVIL BITCH!!!!!,"That’s important, because Pelosi is leading the most diverse Democratic caucus in memory, a “great kaleidoscope,” as she likes to call it. This is her Congress: She engineered the strategy for taking back the House in 2006 with Rahm Emanuel, a two-year congressman she tapped to be her deputy, and who likes to call her “mommy.” That was a time of some intense giggling, with the two of them—the fancy lady and the potty-mouthed Rahmbo—so ambitious, so driven, that every possible seat that could be occupied by a Democrat is now occupied by a Democrat, which is an opportunity and a challenge. There’s nowhere to go but down. Forty-nine House Democrats are from districts that McCain carried. Twenty-six of the 35 freshmen Democrats are in seats occupied in the last cycle by Republicans. “I mean, every day she is subjected to constant criticism and griping,” President Obama joked about Pelosi at a DNC fund-raiser in mid-October. “And then there’s the other party.”",0
1443947350989230091,Nancy Pelosi is an EVIL BITCH!!!!!,"The other party is very much outside her bubble, barely noticed. “Nancy really doesn’t care about Republicans, because she doesn’t believe the whole bi-partisan thing exists,” says a close associate. “Her attitude is, ‘God bless their souls, but these people don’t believe in global warming. They just don’t agree with us.’ ” She loves Obama, knows that he’s her best hope. “She has a new source of energy, in wanting this young man to succeed,” says Congressman George Miller, a close friend, a bit gooily. But there have been a few rocks here and there. She was getting upset over the summer, says a source, at the way Obama was pandering to conservatives to secure a bi-partisan bill, though her office says she was more concerned with the lethargy of the finance committee at the time. Don’t waste your time, they are not voting with us, she told him. Did someone tell you they would? The president’s attitude was, well, the Republicans are elected, and we’re elected; let’s all make this work together. Emanuel would get the same earful from her: Does the president not understand the way this game works? He wants to get it done and be loved, and you can’t do both—which does he want?",0
1443947350989230091,Nancy Pelosi is an EVIL BITCH!!!!!,"So, in August, she went back to California to take a breather, at her Napa Valley winery. She hung out with her husband, a handsome guy who performs in musicals and likes breaking into song at cocktail parties, and her grandkids, who call her Mimi. “Do me a favor, elect me,” she likes to say. “Do me two, let me stay at home with my grandkids.” She has eight of them, plus four daughters, including politician-in-training Christine and documentarian Alexandra, and a son in environmental advocacy. David Axelrod came to one of her donor events in Napa with his wife, but Pelosi didn’t let on that she was upset with the president. This is a process, she thought, everything is a process. It’s just like dealing with your kids: Count to ten, calm down, don’t yell at anybody, and they’ll come around eventually.",0
1443947350989230091,Nancy Pelosi is an EVIL BITCH!!!!!,"But then the bubble was penetrated, as happens on rare occasions, and something actually did get to her. At the height of the tea-party movement, she was disturbed by the anger, the hate, the talk of Nazis, a census worker found hanging from a tree. On September 17, during her weekly news conference, she cracked. “We are a free country, and this balance between freedom and safety is one that we have to carefully balance,” she said, her voice starting to shake. “I have concerns about some of the language that is being used, because I saw this myself in the late seventies in San Francisco.” She was thinking of Harvey Milk and George Moscone, and the way their deaths rocked San Francisco politics at the start of her career. “This kind of rhetoric was very frightening,” she said, blinking back tears. “It created a climate in which violence took place.”",0
1443947350989230091,Nancy Pelosi is an EVIL BITCH!!!!!,"It was the first time she had shown emotion in public, let alone nearly cried, and she seems almost ashamed now when I bring it up. “Those things happened 31 years ago,” she says nervously. “I said what I said at the time.” Then she draws herself up in her chair. “But the fact is that in all of these debates, we have to talk about ideas, and where we go from there, and not characterize or personalize experiences,” she declares. A look of vulnerability crosses her face. “Perhaps I got too involved in my own experience when I spoke in that way,” she says, trailing off and peering at the floor. “I don’t know.”",0
1443947350989230091,Nancy Pelosi is an EVIL BITCH!!!!!,"To look weak in public, well, that’s Pelosi’s worst nightmare. Hillary might cry to boost her poll numbers, but a powerful woman nearing 70 always keeps a stiff upper lip, never showing more emotion than Maggie Thatcher. And, in a way, it works for Pelosi, having the world see only the hard shell, thinking she’s an archetypal female monster with a pasted-on smile. The smile is meant to balance out her aggressive rhetoric, to calm men down, to seem less threatening (it doesn’t work, of course); but it is also a way of shutting people out of her true emotions, who she really is. But that’s okay—she is willing to have people not understand her. If need be, she’s willing to be hated. Not caring makes Pelosi powerful. She’ll listen to her poll numbers from her staff, but she doesn’t really process them. “I’ll take the hit,” she likes to say, waving a hand. “I’ll take the hit.”",0
1443947350989230091,Nancy Pelosi is an EVIL BITCH!!!!!,"In the bubble, she’s who she is: a noodgy, content golden-ager who has remained young at heart. In person, she’s attractive, the monster’s odd doppelgänger: One of her biographers, Vincent Bzdek, says that every male legislator he interviewed for his book Woman of the House commented on her good looks, without prompting. She’s not often a diva, not a screamer. “Nancy is about forward momentum, never looking back, never thinking about the past,” says a friend. “If you try to talk to her about regrets, she just looks at you and says, ‘Don’t be ridiculous.’ ” It’s much more fun to giggle, especially with Obama. A photograph of the two of them sits on a mantel in her office, his birthday present for her 69th. In it, he has on his resolute Mount Rushmore face, but she is smiling, and not with her bug-eyed, automaton smile—he picked a picture with the chocolate-ice-cream smile.",0
1443947350989230091,Nancy Pelosi is an EVIL BITCH!!!!!,"After all, for Pelosi, vote counting is something you do with people you love. She’s the seventh child and only daughter of Thomas “Big Tommy” D’Alesandro Jr., a slick dresser who wore diamond rings on each of his pinkies and began representing Little Italy in Maryland’s House of Delegates at 22, followed by five terms in Congress and three as Baltimore’s mayor. (When asked about his rival in one election, D’Alesandro said, “I don’t know [who he is], but it’s some no-good son of a bitch, that’s all I can tell you.”) Nancy’s childhood home functioned as D’Alesandro’s auxiliary office, with a portrait of FDR in the living room, copies of The Congressional Record stored under her bed, and an open door for constituents searching for jobs, permits, stop signs. The kids manned the front desk, Mom stirred a pot of stew for the hungry, and the blessings that constituents received were written on index cards, then organized into a “favor file.”",0
1443947350989230091,Nancy Pelosi is an EVIL BITCH!!!!!,"After graduating from Trinity College, a girls’ school in D.C., Pelosi married a financier, with whom she then moved to Manhattan—“I love the way the adrenaline just comes up through the ground in New York,” she says—and then San Francisco, when her husband was offered a job at a bank that was lending to tech companies beginning to spring up in Silicon Valley. She began to host Democratic fund-raisers in her home to meet the new community. “Moving to San Francisco at that time, it wouldn’t have been unreasonable for her to trip, but she’s as straight as can be,” says Marc Sandalow, author of Madam Speaker, another biography of Pelosi. Jerry Brown, a high-school acquaintance of her husband’s, needed help running against Jimmy Carter in the 1976 primaries, and Pelosi offered to set him up in Maryland. He carried the state, and she was awarded a seat on the Democratic National Committee for her efforts, quickly rising through the ranks by formidable fund-raising skills and helping to organize the 1984 convention in San Francisco. She ran for national party chairman, but withdrew when she realized that she didn’t have the votes. It’s the only election she hasn’t won in her political career. “People tell me that I was the best-qualified candidate,” she grumbled at the time. “But some of them tell me it’s too bad that I’m not a man.”",0
1443947350989230091,Nancy Pelosi is an EVIL BITCH!!!!!,"But being a woman soon became an advantage. In 1983, Representative Phillip Burton, an architect of the city’s powerful coalition of blacks, environmentalists, gays, and working-class voters, died suddenly of heart failure. He was replaced by his widow, Sala, who soon fell ill with colon cancer, but tapped Pelosi before she died. In the election, Pelosi was a complicated symbol for some feminists—she was demeaned by opponents as a rich mom, a dilettante, a Pacific Heights party girl, and they weren’t sure she wasn’t—but squeaked by in the primary by 3 points. “But Nancy wasn’t a plum picked off a political tree just because someone died, and came to Washington to figure it out,” says Representative Anna Eshoo, a close friend. “Nancy knew who, she knew how.”",0
1443947350989230091,Nancy Pelosi is an EVIL BITCH!!!!!,"The new job was familiar, in fact, though in her telling it had less to do with her father and more to do with her life with her kids. “It felt like an extension of my role as mother,” she says. “From my view, the best thing for my children was for them to live in a world where other children had opportunities, too, where the environment was safe and clean. Back then, there was a tendency for women to minimize what you could bring to the table in intellect and strategic thinking. But men don’t have any secret sauce. So every step of the way, I said to myself, ‘I can do that.’ ” She grins. “And then I knew I could win elections. That’s when I had my breakthrough. I said to myself, ‘You know what? I really know how to do this.’ ”",0
1443947350989230091,Nancy Pelosi is an EVIL BITCH!!!!!,"She crosses her legs. “You know, even being picked as leader of the minority in Congress was a great honor,” she says. “Because they’d never had a woman. Never thought of it. And I’d never have said to someone, ‘Well, isn’t it time we had a woman?’ That would have killed you in terms of votes.”",0
1443947350989230091,Nancy Pelosi is an EVIL BITCH!!!!!,"Pelosi is not thinking about what’s out there, in the hustings. She’s thinking about what’s in the favor file. Votes are what matter. That’s how you keep a majority together. When she asks for members’ votes, she is never strident, telling them what they owe her. (On the other hand, with Paulson and Geithner, she has been known to use some harsh language.) It’s a soft sell in soothing tones—“How are you feeling? How is it looking? Well, you have to vote your conscience,” she’ll say, in almost a whisper. Then she begins to apply pressure behind the scenes. She knows how to get to someone in everyone’s orbit: a wife, a sister, an upper-class donor in the community. This spring, when she heard that new congressman Zack Space, a Greek from a shaky district in Ohio, was balking at voting for the climate-change bill, she quickly got on the phone with powerful donors from prominent Greek-American families, asking them to make a call to him to express their feelings on the subject. Within a day—for whatever reason—he changed his mind.",0
1443947350989230091,Nancy Pelosi is an EVIL BITCH!!!!!,"After all, who brought the new Democratic majority here, may we remind you? Pelosi. She’s the chief fund-raiser of her party: Not only did she personally raise the money for a lot of her members in this Congress, but now she sweats it out every other weekend for the next one, flying commercial to stultifying fund-raisers in Missouri, Wisconsin, Florida, anywhere there is a buck. She’s the best fund-raiser that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has ever had, raising $155 million since 2002, and double the RNCC in September. Each year, she kicks off the party in San Francisco—which, besides being liberal, is rich. “Nancy comes through with candidates for the next election cycle, and you have to give your max contribution to her first,” says a liaison to big donors in the area. That means these donors can only give another maximum payment to the Senate or the national party—not both. “Not everyone wants to do this,” he says. “She makes you.” Money, of course, gives Pelosi an extra dimension of power over her members. “When she helped you to get into office to vote one way and then you don’t,” says a friend, trailing off. “Well, that’s what gets her.”",0
1443947350989230091,Nancy Pelosi is an EVIL BITCH!!!!!,"After all her hard work, she demands loyalty. That’s not too much to ask, is it? And that’s what really upset her about the CIA skirmish last May, what almost became the most damaging moment of her political career. It was such a dirty trick: She’d called for a special truth commission to look at the enhanced interrogation techniques authorized by Bush officials—over the objections from Obama and senators like Harry Reid, who didn’t want to distract from policy priorities—and then word began to circulate, fanned by Republicans, that she too knew about waterboarding as early as September 2002. She immediately denied it, then upped the ante, saying that the CIA had explicitly said that they were not using waterboarding at that time, that they misled Congress. (She did, however, admit that she learned that waterboarding was being used from a staffer in 2003, but didn’t say anything because she felt that it was more important to “change the leadership in Congress and in the White House.”) Then everybody got upset when she basically said the CIA lies, which isn’t exactly a controversial statement, as far as she’s concerned. It was just insane.",0
1443947350989230091,Nancy Pelosi is an EVIL BITCH!!!!!,"Eventually, her colleagues came out to support her, like Senator Bob Graham, who kept meticulous notes of his CIA briefings. But where was Leon Panetta, her old friend from California? He didn’t warn her, says a source. And she should’ve known, she should’ve known everything that was about to happen.",0
1443947350989230091,Nancy Pelosi is an EVIL BITCH!!!!!,"That’s part of why, when it became clear that the scandal was deepening, Pelosi still didn’t really understand that she needed to deal with it—if her pals hadn’t told her she was in trouble, why should she worry? But events were overtaking her. Before one of her press conferences, her staff had to sit her down and explain that this is what the reporters were going to ask about, and she couldn’t believe it. She was in the middle of getting votes to pass her “historic” climate-change legislation, and now everybody wanted to talk about this? What’s wrong with people?",0
1443947350989230091,Nancy Pelosi is an EVIL BITCH!!!!!,"Her office now says she was simply tired of all the repetitive questions. These days, she still thinks she did nothing wrong. “We have to protect the American people, and our founders said we have to do it in a way that honors our Constitution,” she says, an edge coming into her voice. “And they”—the conservatives—“don’t always agree with me on that, so they come after me one way or another.” She shakes her head. “They know it’s a ridiculous charge.”",0
1443947350989230091,Nancy Pelosi is an EVIL BITCH!!!!!,"It is ridiculous, a lot of what Pelosi has to put up with, barely worth noticing, but that’s government for you. Her next fight will be about the war in Afghanistan, which she thinks we should have been talking about years ago: “It’s a tremendous challenge, exacerbated by the fact that there was no plan for eight years—and nobody denies that,” she sputters. “It’s just—just—ridiculous!” So every week, she’s out there, banging the drum for what she thinks is right, like closing the Medicare drug-benefit “doughnut hole” with ancient representative John Dingell—“This is about older Americans,” she says. “And I say that proudly; I don’t want anyone to think I’m talking about anyone else”—or helping to unveil the new Helen Keller statue in the Rotunda (she took the hand of a blind man and guided him to touch it). “It’s a fight,” she tells a group of education advocates, assembled in the basement of the Capitol to give her an award, about her negotiations on education legislation. “You fight to get it to a certain place, and then it’s zeroed out, and you have to fight to split the difference. And you hope for a high split.” Her voice rises. “It shouldn’t even be. I mean, these are priorities”—the eyes are coming out—“that should compete favorably with anything else going on here.” A big smile: “We are, after all, talking about the education of our children!”",0
1443947350989230091,Nancy Pelosi is an EVIL BITCH!!!!!,"So that’s what she’s going for with health care, too, a high split. She’s knows that this is the moment to accomplish a lot of her agenda—and if she loses some of her members in the next election, well, that’s why she built a majority. The progressives are mad that they’re not going to get a robust public option, sure. But she threw in her good name, and she still couldn’t get it. That’s not a reason to revolt. “There’s a good deal of resentment,” says a congressman. “The liberals are going to go through the seven stages of grief.” But Pelosi loves them, and she’s going to make them take their medicine.",0
1443947350989230091,Nancy Pelosi is an EVIL BITCH!!!!!,"In 2012, or 2016, if she loses the House, well, she might go home. Pelosi doesn’t harbor any national ambitions after the Speakership. She’s not going to be walking the halls like Denny Hastert, or protesting with Lynn Woolsey—she’ll be going to the ballet and the opera in San Francisco with her husband. She worries about getting older, about whether she’ll see her grandkids go to high school.",0
1443947350989230091,Nancy Pelosi is an EVIL BITCH!!!!!,"But that doesn’t mean that it isn’t fun to do a bit more theater. Last week, at the unveiling ceremony for her new health-care bill on the Capitol steps, she smiled away, reminding everybody that they should celebrate this historic day. On the lawn, a knot of protesters kept shouting at her, distracting from her important purpose. “You will burn in hell for this,” one man yelled into his megaphone, over and over.",0

It’s happening today as unemployment is about to run out.. Look at the stimulus bills that were issued to help assist the people that couldn’t work with no income coming in. She held out and would not allow a crisis go to waste. She needed to stuff her pockets with money to help fund planned parenthood and the Kennedy center. Pelosi only cares about power and what will benefit her. It’s all about making Trump look bad. She wants people to suffer. You see, it’s political. She feels the more you suffer during Trump’s administration then people are going to vote democratic. In San Francisco not far from her mansion, she has people sleeping in tents due to unaffordable housing. People without proper facilities defalcating in the streets. Remember the lack of sensitivity shown when she displayed her 20,000 dollar freezer filled with dove ice cream bars while others didn’t have money for groceries.

1443947350989230091,Nancy Pelosi is an EVIL BITCH!!!!!,The most obvious example of this disdain is the often expressed notion that working people won't go back to work if they can make more from unemployment.

Pelosi is not the mayor of San Francisco, a member of the Board of Supervisors, or the governor of California; the fact that her Congressional district includes San Francisco doesn’t give her any authority in San Francisco.",0

1443947350989230091,Nancy Pelosi is an EVIL BITCH!!!!!,"Well…I’ll be frank. Not Frank, just frank, okey dokey? Okay. Nancy Pelosi is one of the biggest reasons I went from being a Democrat, several years ago, to a conservative. But then people like Mitch McConnell scared me into being an independent, but that is beside the point. My slightly censored, uncensored opinion of Ms Pelosi is that she is a prime example of a completely out-of-touch politician, who has no connections with reality, and rarely stands up for her constituents or voters, and abuses her power like the best of them. I think she is a selfish, idiotic, angry, greedy shell of a human, with no soul. If I were religious, I'd consider her a prime candidate for the anti-christ. A spawn of the devil. A sub human. A walking penis with really bad hair. Does she ever brush that creature on her head? I think she actually died 30 years ago, but her heart is so black, it runs on childrens' tears, and the souls of virgins, puppies, kittens, and cute little baby hedgehogs, so her body and mouth keep going, years after her brain has turned to dust. Multi-fuel engines were modeled on her blackened, crusty heart. If she had been a freshly minted 2nd lieut. in Vietnam, she would have gotten her ass fragged by her own men.",0

Now, in the world of sanity these characteristics don’t actually determine truth or reality. But this is the Democratic Party we’re talking about.

People who say there’s a crisis at the border but then refuse to sign a bill that would send aid to that border. On the other side are the Democrats who actually want to retain a majority. Nancy Pelosi dared to criticize the woke left. Some don’t realize this but the woke left are wildly over-represented on social media. This is why a lot of smart liberals have had one piece of advice for democrats. Get off Twitter. Go out and actually talk to real people.

1443947350989230091,Nancy Pelosi is an EVIL BITCH!!!!!,"Nancy Pelosi, I think, is to the Democratic base right now what John McCain was to the Republican base.

I personally don’t care if someone is rich, but please don’t lecture us about how awful Republicans are because they don’t care for the little guy! Then she got her panties in a wad over Trump stopping most travel from China and took to the streets of San Francisco calling him xenophobic and encouraged everyone to go to China Town and enjoy the celebrations and parades. Then she later blamed Trump for not taking the virus seriously. Oh, and who can forget the whole lot of them donning some sort of African scarf without really knowing what it stood for, and self righteously kneeling in Congress in honor of George Floyd, yet not one of them ever did diddly squat to pass prison reform or try to go into the poor communities to encourage economic growth ( unlike the Opportunity Zones that have begun to bring some life into these areas.) and her most recent antics were to keep a COVID relief bill from being passed until biden was supposedly elected. This came straight from her own mouth. She would include bail outs for largely Democrat States that had blown their budgets for years and need help from the Federal government ( COVID relief help for states was different). She preens in front of the cameras with her matching mask and insist that the other side hates science and kills people because of it while she goes to a hair salon and doesn’t wear her mask then has the gall to blame the salon owner. She waves her boney finger at us and reminds us that we should be grateful for her $600 stipend while attaching a multi billion dollar 5,000 page monster bill full of lobbyists wishes granted for stupid studies and foreign aid for unnecessary causes! The lists is long why she is so disliked. I find her to be a despicable and disgusting, hypocritical human being.",0

UsMagazine.com has an exclusive peek at Playboy’s March issue, where the singer, 32, dishes on everything from his past relationships with Jessica Simpson and Jennifer Aniston to his dream mate. He dubs 29-year-old Simpson (whom he dated from 2006 to 2007) “a drug.” “And drugs aren’t good for you if you do lots of them,” he says, adding, “Yeah, that girl is like crack cocaine to me.” “Sexually it was crazy. That’s all I’ll say,” he continues. “It was like napalm, sexual napalm. Did you ever say, ‘I want to quit my life and just f*****’ snort you? If you charged me $10,000 to f*** you, I would start selling all my s*** just to keep f****** you.’” He didn’t share bedroom details about Aniston, who turns 41 Thursday. But he denied reports that he penned the tune “Heartbreak Warrior” about her. “That woman would never use heartbreak warfare,” he tells Playboy. “That woman was the most communicative, sweetest, kindest person.” He also denied that Twitter obsession led to their split last year. “There was a rumor that I’d been dumped because I was tweeting too much,” he says. “That wasn’t it, but that was a big difference. The brunt of her success came before TMZ and Twitter. I think she’s still hoping it goes back to 1998. She saw my involvement in technology as courting distraction. And I always said, ‘These are the new rules.’” Oh, and how many women has he bedded since their break-up? “I’m going to say four or five. No more,” he tells Playboy. “But even if I said 12, that’s a reasonable number. So is 15. Here’s the thing: I get less a** now than I did when I was in a local band. Because now I don’t like jumping through hoops.” These says, he says he is hesitant to settle down. “I hate being the heartbreaker. Hate it,” he says. “If I date somebody and it doesn’t work out, it’s another nightmare for me.” Of course, any interview with Mayer would not be complete without an Us Weekly reference. Asked about his future, he says, “From now on I’m just going to pretend that people really dig the s*** out of me. I’ve been trying to prove to people I’m not a douche bag by not dating, by keeping my name out of Us Weekly. That’s f***** up, man. I’m not dating. I’m not even f******.

Firstly, he speaks with a restless, accelerated enthusiasm that’s hugely engaging. Secondly, his brain is like a well-thumbed encyclopedia volume on the great guitarists of our time.

Starting out at The Verve’s Nick McCabe, the first player to catch his ear as a child, Walker veers from Keith Richards, George Harrison and Jimmy Page to Robbie Basho, Bert Jansch and John Martyn, Steve Hackett, John Abercrombie and Derek Bailey, Sonny Sharrock, Jeff Parker and Bill Frisell, and on to Tom Morello and Thurston Moore.",0

It’s the furthest Walker has travelled from the Anglophile folk of 2015’s celebrated Primrose Green and, he says, “the most confident and put-together playing I’ve ever done on record”. He’s calling it, with tongue only slightly in cheek, his prog album.",0

Steve Hackett was doing stuff nobody else did. Droney, feedbacky stuff, tapping, 12-string playing, fingerstyle, solos… Genesis is not prog with a capital P, they had a sense of humour. I love prog that’s rooted in reality, not so much the dwarves and magical fairies.”",0

By 2016’s Golden Songs That Have Been Sung, he was pointing towards more ambitious abstractions, less indebted to Martyn, Jansch and Tim Buckley. The evolution was advanced on 2018’s Deafman Glance, and Course In Fable completes the journey. Not one for standing still, Walker has also made two albums with jazz drummer Charles Rumback and a live record with Japanese psych-rockers Kikagaku Moyo.",0

We’re big fans of John Renbourn and Bert Jansch. That record they did [Bert And John], is how we first came together – let’s make a great acoustic duo record, but we always end up talking about Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix or Minutemen, that’s what Chicago music is to me, punk-rock influenced prog.

Freak folk was really big and they all come from punk-rock backgrounds, but were into Fairport Convention, a weird marriage of noise music and British prog, singing about finding a magical mushroom on a mountain surrounded by dragons. From there, I was a fingerpicking maniac.”",0

For his fifth album, Tortoise mastermind John McEntire was the natural choice as producer, Walker and his band – MacKay, Andrew Scott Young and Ryan Jewell – decamping to Hallowed Hall Studios in Portland, Oregon. Fuelled by the Pacific Northwest’s reputable coffee and regular smoking breaks, they recorded the album in three days.",0

We did all the songs live, but the magic was handing him the keys to mix however he wanted. He added keys and synths and brought everything to the front of the mix in a Steely Dan way. I’ve always hidden my voice behind reverb, even the guitar parts. I’ve never had my right hand shine. Here, it’s all bare, naked and up-front and I really like that. He brought a new confidence in the music.”",0

I have a G&L Broadcaster from 1985 that I bought last year. I play fingerstyle with acrylic nails and I’m always looking for an electric that suits that.

1443941131096629253,@daz_pd44 Since they cancelled their Florida shows with no explanation you should bring one that says John Mayer is pond scum,"There are quite a few traits in the West Coast that you will rarely find in the East Coast. The main “westerner holier than thou” principle you have to understand is that West-Coasters think they are all around so, so, so much better than you and the rest of the world in each and every area of life that you need to get re-trained and learn to abide by their good manners/way of thinking/political opinion or you will suffer dire repercussions. They will judge you, and tell you how to speak, how to dress ,what your opinion should be and what to eat or like. First consequence: you can forget refreshing things such as having a mind of your own, being honest, speaking your mind, or voicing any opinion -political or not- that is different than that of the local mainstream or you will never work/date/have friends again. Look how fast comments get deleted or people get banned from social media for having voiced an opinion! ? In the West coast, a faux-pas is something that you truly cannot define as it could be just about ANYTHING as people here use fabricated slight and false faux-pas to ban you, fire you or outright outcast you. I got lectured one day for, after a motor vehicle collision, saying at work that “I was hospitalized”. Mind you, it was shocking! People here use that also to avoid any kind of accountability. Let me map this out for you:",0
1443941131096629253,@daz_pd44 Since they cancelled their Florida shows with no explanation you should bring one that says John Mayer is pond scum,"* Lack of professional accountability and perfect inability to take constructive criticism gracefully. One example: I was asked as a consulting gig to bring a research department up to speed. The manager even told me that this department had a very bad reputation due to their inability at delivering projects within the industry standards. Since I was asked to review some pages of a Data Capture System, I actually reviewed them. The Senior Data Manager had made a shockingly, terrible job in creating these pages. I commented on what needed to be changed in a non-judgmental manner “Per Privacy regulations, you cannot request this info…” or “These are not anatomical locations, please remove from the drop down menu”) and I turned my review in... Ô Sacrilege! Ô Lese-majesty crime! Why would I dare to do what I was asked for and review this, rather than saying “perfect” and signing off without reading anything? This turned into an unpleasant discussion with the above-mentioned manager. I was left wondering why on earth would they immaturely ask for a review when all they wanted were congratulations? I guess the answer lays in the word “immaturely”.
 * Doers, fixers, and productive people are perceived as threats and holding people accountable is a sin therefore, nothing ever gets fixed here before it gets to hell in a hand-basket, because, instead of fixing issues and moving forward, they expect you to move forward without fixing anything, and if you do, shooting the messenger is the name of the game. The idea is that root cause analysis and corrective action are judgmental swear words so let’s skip this and get to “move on” without fixing anything. I have observed this same pattern a gazillion time here, with cohorts of consultants being hired by companies to assess compliance or for auditing purposes, then being fired for daring to do their job by flagging a compliance issue (Isn't that the purpose of any assessment?)! Just because people are SO immature and SO vainglorious that they just cannot respond like a grown-up person: ""Good catch Chris! Thanks for finding this!"". The realization of any mistake is absolutely unbearable and most companies instead of running a serious root cause analysis will do e-v-e-r-y-t-h-i-n-g they can to protect the wrongdoer and get rid of the messenger. Until they end up -weeks away from an inspection- having to summon another consultant that they will pay 10 times more for an expedited job, to tell them the very same thing than the first one they fired because they do not want to hear anything than “wonderful job”.
 * Lecturing/Blaming victims (specifically women, because being upset or outraged is somewhat okay for a male) is common practice. One would think that with the flawless progressive image that the West Coast has: Sanctuary cities, human rights, etc (which is exclusively a facade), out of all places, SFBA would be the place where victims could feel safe, supported and understood... Well, NO. I have seen people publicly throwing objects in contractors' face (for no reason and out of the blue) and getting away with it without even an apology, and the company getting rid of… The contractor! I used to be Domestic Violence advocate, I have seen female attorneys, LECTURING harshly their female clients about the way they were talking about their ex-husband, whose ex-husband violated a restraining order, broke into their home, raped them, beat them to a pulp, and slashed their face and their entire body, in front of their kids! I was SO shocked by this. Here is this woman who has been laying in a pool of her own blood in an ER bed, raped and stabbed all over by a felon, her kids are forever traumatized, and the only interesting thing this degenerate attorney have to tell her is that calling this guy a scumbag, it is not okay? What other title does he deserve anyway? The victim has to show deference to her aggressor otherwise the passive-aggressive holier-than-thou priggish West Coast society could side against her!? Earlier there was the case of another woman being left all by herself during childbirth by the oh-so-famous teaching hospital’s staff to punish her for “being difficult” (knowing that being difficult is just voicing a different opinion than theirs) to the point that they did not do a C-Section on time and her daughter ended up with cerebral palsy (It was all over the news here). And these people were SO convinced that they were right, that “she was being difficult” is the reasoning they served in court to justify the fact that this poor kid is now disabled for the rest of her life! Needless to say that the hospital ended up paying millions. This is not a rare occurrence and since this institution is self-insured, California taxpayers (who are subjected to this type of “care” and already pay the higher taxes in the nation) pays millions of dollars in settlements for this “outstanding” facility, over and over and over while little to no measures are being taken against wrongdoers. But don’t go call your representative to task on that because, mind you, this would be “not nice”! What is this blathering idiocracy? Think of it for a minute...This really is the most perfect definition of ""adding insult to injury"".
 * Very loose relationship with truth, results, and reality. Which working in science, I find very alarming. When someone here tells you “I believe 2+3 =12” you’d better say “okay” and walk away, or beat around the bush for 2 hours and apologize 10 times before you suggest that in fact, they MAY reconsider their answer because you are afraid that there MAY be another answer (Don’t say it is incorrect or wrong, these are swear-words), otherwise you are offensive. If by the way you want to pursue in this direction, they will finally tell you: “let’s agree to disagree”, which is okay when we talk about whether you like kale or not but when it goes to science and basic math, there is almost no room for ""opinions"": it is either right OR wrong, hence your entire mind is screaming “WAIT! WHAAAT?” but you’d better shut up and refrain from disagreeing otherwise you are ""self-righteous, and inappropriate"". In the workplace in the SFBA, you just SHOULD NEVER MAKE ANYONE FEEL THAT THEY ARE WRONG EVER, no matter what they do and how serious this is. Do they break the regulations? Fine! Just pretend you did not see it! Problems come when you are in a position to sign off on anything and at that point, you either sign off on something you know is wrong and you hope for the best OR you voice your concern and you get fired. 2 years ago, a friend of mine got fired from a SFBA company (literally a hell hole that ranks in the top 10 of the best places to work) because she was asked to review a budget and she found out that a manager had forgotten one full line of budget in the initial request form for funds. Because of that, the whole budget was slashed by a quarter-million dollars. YET, although she was not even remotely responsible for the mistake, finding this mistake cost her her job! Which gets me to the next point:
 * Unreliable and able to flat-out lie if need be; Since they cannot fathom that being a grown-up means being able to acknowledge mistakes and take ownership, and since they know they can hide behind their ""Ohhh you are so offensive"" thing, westerners will lie to your face like nobody's business. Don't take anything at its face value, verify everything, take note of all your meetings and all your 1:1, because they will lie and throw you under the bus in a blink to cover up for their mistakes. If someone tells you that they will help you move, don't count on them, 90% of the time, they won't show up. If someone tells you ""let's have lunch sometime next week"" or ""let's keep in touch"" don't even count on it NorCal people don’t ever speak their mind.
 * Widespread and institutionalized backstabbing: Do not turn your back ever, you have a dart-board between our shoulder-blades! There is no business etiquette and no loyalty, your Boss will have no problem talking about you in your back (without even telling you nor giving you the opportunity to explain that Jane hates your guts because you caught her being late) and will encourage the back-stabbing behavior. They will implement these little ""informal meetings"" behind your back where they will encourage people to badmouth you (combine this to the previous and next points and see how well this could pan out). But it gets better: No matter how outstanding your achievements are, no matter if the vast majority of your colleagues are thinking that you are the greatest, they will focus on the ONE opinion of the ONE poorly-performing-misbehaving individual of the group who will have a negative opinion of you because, in their futile mindset, everybody should get the others to love them, otherwise it does not mean that everybody is entitled to their own opinion, it means that you are bad. Specifically, if you are not from “the Bay”, you will be under extreme scrutiny and everything you say or do will be judged through a negative filter. What a non-judgemental place to be, indeed, right?
 * Flaking and superficiality...To the point that folks are shocked when you show up on time, or when you do what you promised you would do! Lucky you if they schedule something and even bother to cancel an appointment with you. Do not count on anybody, there is no true friendship here, it stops when you leave the company, or when you run into the slightest problem, then you are on your own.
 * Obnoxious, mean, self-centered and brainless drivers, brainless leadership: There are hundreds of miles of traffic jam on the highways around the SFBA, due to the fact that renting on the peninsula is out of reach for the vast majority of the families, hence people are obligated to commute. Out of 10 of the most polluted cities in the US, 8 are in California. YET mass transportation remains at a ridiculous embryo stage. So much for the lessons of eco-citizenship, global warming (they should maybe look into their own backyard first) California gives all around. These people are beating around the bush with the BART since…1957! It took them FIVE YEARS to just draw the plans (compare that to New York public transportation whose first elevated line was constructed in 1867-1870 by Charles Harvey!). To date, the system does not even go to Silicon Valley. In 2010, they suddenly figured that BART overhead structures could collapse in case of an earthquake (Come on! After 2 major quakes in the last century? That’s what the no criticism policy brings to the table)…More delays! In the meantime there are more cars on the highways AND Drivers keep on hogging left lanes while driving under the speed limit, creating gigantic jams despite the dozens of ""slower traffic keep right"" signs, and of course, the highway patrol does not do anything. These drivers also dangerously accelerate when you want to pass them on the right so that you cannot pass at all (and the jam keeps on building). They immaturely pretend they do not notice the miles-long procession of cars behind them nor that dozens of cars are trying to pass them on the right either. 80% of them drive with their phone to their ear or text and drive (I can confirm that headsets are sold over the counter in California and that most cars have blue tooth), they change lane right in front of you without even signaling, then all of the sudden between the traffic, the change of lane and the undivided attention they were paying to their texts, they get totally disoriented and they break their a** off right in front of you... I have seen people brushing their teeth in the traffic. Or people stopped on the highway to finish their text. Roads have potholes the size of a kitchen [double] sink and of course, nobody holds elected officials accountable because ""that's not nice""...
What are the positive sides of the place? I am searching for 7 years... In vain. The weather? Perhaps. But 8 hours at work, 3 hours in traffic per day, a terrible pollution, 5-6 hours one way to drive to Lake Tahoe or Yosemite due to traffic, Rents that are beyond crazy: When and how could you enjoy the outdoors anyway?",0

1443941131096629253,@daz_pd44 Since they cancelled their Florida shows with no explanation you should bring one that says John Mayer is pond scum,"- ATTITUDE: It seems like the east is just rush rush rush.  People walk at a faster pace, if you don't keep up with that pace they look at you funny.  I think people tend to be a little sharper and to the point in the east because they are more focused.  The west is a little slow with a lot of flaky people that complain over everything.  As one person said already, if you and a friend are going out to lunch or just plan to hang out, there is probably only a 40% chance it will actually happen.  I've heard this story so many times that it's almost a joke by now.  The fact is, west coast people will typically cancel about an hour or even half hour before the appointment but most of the time it's 20 minutes after the agreed time.  That is, if they bother to reply.  HINT:  You should always check a few hours before the meeting to see if that person is still on for today.  Who the hell would show up blindly based on an agreement made 4 days ago? If you just txt that person an hour before and ask, ""You still comin?"" You'll have your answer.  Don't show up if you don't get a reply.  It's as simple as that.  This happens so frequently to me that I just thought this was the norm until some east coast people pointed out to me that east coast people don't flake like this.",0

1443941131096629253,@daz_pd44 Since they cancelled their Florida shows with no explanation you should bring one that says John Mayer is pond scum,"I entirely agree with your post. I was raised in the Boston area but have been out in California for the past 10 years for school and work. Moving to the Bay Area was definitely an adjustment for me in terms of learning to be careful about how I frame what I say and making sure I use lots of words to say it. Californians are notoriously politically correct and tend to be more emotionally sensitive than people on the east coast (who are blunt and sarcastic). They also enjoy using many unnecessary words (my theory is that they simply enjoy basking in friendly interactions and prolonging that ""spirit of friendliness"" by using many words to say something that could be spit out). For instance, I might just say that a bucket is to the right of the piano, but a Californian will actually describe the color of the bucket, the handle of the bucket, and maybe the piano bench. Being ""happy,"" or sustaining the appearance of happiness, is equated with success out here and displaying negative emotion (sadness, anxiety, anger) too readily is seen as weakness. This is not the case on the East Coast, where people actually bond over being neurotic and toughing out real things together (like frigid winters and snow!). Being happy is not actually equated with success (only money and status is). And overfriendliness/striking up conversations with random strangers is probably viewed as mental illness (check out this hilarious interview with Anna Kendrick on East Coast/West Coast differences: 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHeP4HKZ0Mw
). East Coasters tend to be more matter of fact, pragmatic, competitive (I attribute this to the high density areas) and conventional in their outlook, whereas West Coasters thrive on idealism, positivity, openness, creativity, and collaboration. I think there are pros and cons to both ways of being- I'd like to think that my East Coast toughness and intensity is being channeled in positive directions through West Coast creativity and openness. I'd advise everyone to try both coasts at some point to ""get the best of both worlds"" and figure out which parts you'd like to embody in your own lifestyle.",0

One other thing is people from the west coast love to talk, and talk about themselves; people from the Northeast don`t do this, but not because they`re less arrogant- we just generally don`t think our lives are other people`s business. Since the west coast is less steeped in history than the East Coast, people make connections more through friends or acquaintances or via networking, it seems, than through school or growing up.

The president was apparently spending his Sunday night taking in an MSNBC Justice for All town hall about criminal justice reform when he sensed insufficient gratitude for his role in signing the bipartisan First Step Act into law last winter. Such insolence! There was only one solution: send out a string of tweets calling out four prominent people of color—Van Jones, Lester Holt, John Legend, and Chrissy Teigen—for not professing total fealty to dear leader. While the tweets were all insulting, they were especially malicious toward Teigen, who doesn’t get a name, but rather the designation of Legend’s “filthy-mouthed wife.” Yes, the president responsible for my mom saying the words “pussy” and “shithole” to me for the first time ever has a problem with colorful language in his dainty ears.

1443932008623837186,@TMZ Chrissy Teigen is a calculating bitch. Fuck her everyday &amp; twice on Sunday just for fun.,"Sometimes, the president is selective about who he starts a fight with, and at other times he appears to be functioning completely on autopilot. With reporters, it’s anyone who rubs him the wrong way in the slightest or proves disloyal. (Lately, he has even begun to include certain Fox News pundits in the latter category.) With politicians, it’s roughly the same. However, it sure seems as though he’s more likely to go after a reporter or politician more viciously when it’s a person of color. Weird how that happens! With celebrities, there appears to be more than instinct involved. While Trump is excited for the chance to have any well-known celebrities on his side—the whole Kanye thing is thrilling for him—he’s more deliberative about which celebrities to counterpunch. The key factor seems to be how his base feels about these people. Trump fans may not have a problem with suddenly having to despise the likes of Meryl Streep and Debra Messing. They may not love having to consider Robert De Niro an enemy, but they’re certainly willing to go down that road. Curiously, though, Eminem went crazy viral with a “freestyle” about the president, telling his Trump-supporting fans “fuck you” if they stuck with Trump, and somehow the president didn’t respond at all. There’s no way the information escaped him. These things never do. But something in his cultural Spidey sense told him to let that one go, that engaging critically with Eminem was a nonstarter. This same thought either did not occur to him when he started a flame war with Chrissy Teigen—or he underestimated her as a cultural opponent.",0
1443932008623837186,@TMZ Chrissy Teigen is a calculating bitch. Fuck her everyday &amp; twice on Sunday just for fun.,"Donald Trump is probably not aware of the particular celebrity perch Teigen occupies. She is a multiplatform force: model turned cookbook author turned TV host. It also seems like she has a separate career that consists entirely of being a beloved Twitter figure. Teigen long ago graduated from “Can you believe this supermodel is actually kind of funny?” to simply being known as a clever, charming, inexplicably relatable personality, whose tweets often end up inspiring Mashable articles. She is easily the most Twitter-savvy opponent Trump has ever taken on, narrowly edging out Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who is formidable in her own right but also bound by certain standards we expect from politicians, from which Teigen is free. It is likely that Trump was unaware of Teigen’s status as a Twitter godhead, because he may be unaware of anyone else’s reach on the platform beyond his own, which he considers supreme. So, was it an unwise oversight for the president to go after someone so witty and beloved in his casually misogynist yet also dorky fashion, or was it a cold calculation? The downside for him is that Chrissy Teigen obviously has comebacks for days, and she’s popular enough that her 11.5 million followers will be hashtagging and retweeting them for even longer. Within hours of his attack on her, #PresidentPussyAssBitch became a Twitter sensation, if not a trending topic, because Twitter also dislikes a filthy mouth. (#FilthyMouthedWife is currently trending, though.)",0

Fuck her everyday &amp; twice on Sunday just for fun.,"Those with a membership card in the Cult of Donald are preprogrammed to side with their guy in a culture war. They may have passively watched Teigen on Bring the Funny before, but there’s no way their attachment to her is strong enough to overcome their attachment to Trump, which they have likely sacrificed so much social currency to maintain. It doesn’t matter that to an objective observer—if there could be such a thing these days—it may seem like a ridiculous use of presidential oxygen for Trump to attack Chrissy Teigen. That doesn’t matter to the people on his side. Whatever amazing future comebacks she may have, to the Cult of Donald it is just the hate-filled rantings of the filthy-mouthed wife who dared disrespect Mr. Trump. (Which she apparently did not?) There is no other side to the triumph of watching a person with as much power as Trump get dunked on by large swaths of Twitter. Every single time Mitch McConnell tweets, he gets ratio’d to hell, and yet he’s still out there, ruining lives every day, utterly undeterred. It would probably be more meaningful if Trump’s provocation just went ignored, but I mean, come on. It’s not in Chrissy Teigen’s DNA to ignore being called out by the president. She can’t win here, though. Because Trump empirically cannot lose in a flame war with a liberal celebrity. Trump may not have a Bret Stephens-style “I’m-not-owned!” meltdown over the blowback to his little hissy fit, but he doesn’t need to in order to win. All he needs to do is refuse to acknowledge the blowback in any way except the way that helps him: by letting it confirm that the Trump Haters are at it again. He also gets something else out of this: a Monday morning where the internet is abuzz with talk about Chrissy Teigen instead of the Taliban or Sharpies or the Bahaman hurricane survivors kicked off a ferry to Ft. Lauderdale over visa concerns or the mind-boggling blatant corruption that has been right in front of us since day one and continues to be reported on but never challenged in any significant way.",0

The silly groom had made this arrogant remark, What Megham=n wants, Meghan gets. Naturally, this sheer insolence was ignored and she got what was offered. And although she was indulged far beyond the norm, she went on demanding vast expenditure on the wedding, all kinds of impossible changes , people swept off the streets, carriage procession etc, and a white wedding depite her two previous outings, and absolutely servile attention from a high class staff. It was rolerated for far too long, which made her think she was going to have the Queen move over, take precedence of other members of the royal family, and do just what she wanted, not the work being a member involves. Her plan as revealed was to make commercial capital out of her marriage, but not do any of the suties.

I’ve committed adultery in my heart many times.” In my heart were the operative words, though they were largely lost in the kerfuffle that followed. Carter later claimed the comment sent his campaign into a temporary tailspin, dropping fifteen points in the polls. One of the most religiously devout candidates in modern times, a true choir boy, Carter had confessed to something remarkable in the political environment of his day: being human. Later, he went one step further. In an interview with writer Norman Mailer, Carter said, “’I don’t care if people say ‘fuck.’” Flash forward. Republican nominee Donald Trump, who enjoys the support of many evangelicals, conservatives, and self-proclaimed family value advocates—is caught on tape not just lusting in his heart, but using the crudest of terms to describe his failed efforts to bed a married woman: “I moved on her like a bitch, but I couldn’t get there.” He then is heard boasting of his wider sexploits and irresistible star-charisma. “Grab them by the pussy,” he says, apparently too self-absorbed to even bother with seduction. “You can do anything.” All the while, his newlywed wife Melania (make that his third wife) was at home with child. The revulsion expressed by many at Trump’s remarks had nothing to do with puritanism or sexual repression, and everything to do with their predatory nature, the disregard for his wife, and the boastfulness, mixed with libido, that produced such toxic vanity. The two episodes, Carter’s contretemps and Trump’s trumpeting of his sexual prowess, came from entirely different places, and define not only the gulf between these two candidates but the chasm that divides America in its bicentennial year and the America of today.",0

1443929394544881670,Jimmy Carter is fucking ancient and still doing construction work and liberals are still drooling over GWB fucking painting,"Sunday mornings in Plains, Georgia, Mr. Jimmy wakes in his unchanged ranch home with the '70s appliances and same old Formica countertops at the usual hour of 5 A.M., and inevitably scribbles some Bible-lesson notes that he mostly never refers to, and then, after his ablutions and 7 A.M. breakfast with Rosalynn—oatmeal is a favorite—the Secret Service ferries him through town in a black car, past the gas station that was once his brother's, past his old campaign headquarters in a little warehouse, past the home Rosalynn was born in, to Maranatha Baptist Church. The church is the bull's-eye of his stomping grounds—the verdant flatland upon which Plains sits, where he hunts and fishes. He receives vegetables from the farm where he grew up, a few miles outside town, which is now on the National Register of Historic Places. He visits every so often, and there's the old bedroom that belonged to Mr. Jimmy, with a model wooden ship and weathered copy of War and Peace, and there's the dining-room table at which the Carter family—two girls and two boys—sat to eat, or sat to read and eat, as Mr. Jimmy's mother, Lillian, insisted that her children always be reading. And there's the scrubby red-dirt tennis court built by Mr. Jimmy's daddy, Earl, a Sunday-school teacher himself, who employed a wicked slice to always beat his son. About 40 Sundays a year, Mr. Jimmy materializes from thin air, flickering before us at Maranatha to lead Bible study, to say, No, the world's not going to end. Not just yet. Though he's elfin with age, you'd still instantly recognize him as our 39th president: with those same hooded ice-blue eyes, the same rectangular head, the same famous 1,000-watt smile. But when he teaches like this, he transforms from whatever your vision of Jimmy Carter is into someone different, some kind of 93-year-old Yoda-like knower, who in his tenth decade on earth still possesses that rarest of airy commodities: hope. Hope is something that Mr. Jimmy thinks about a lot—and faith, too, from which hope rises in the first place. It's something that you're born with, faith, but also something you must re-apply every day, like a gel or cream. He says first you have faith in your mama, when you're suckling at her breast. And then you have faith in your people: the tight-knit circle of kin and neighbors in your town. Then—your country. He says what might be most important, though, is faith in a creator of some sort. Mr. Jimmy says you can fill in the blank: Muhammad, Buddha, Jesus…Gaia, Martians, T'Challa, king of Wakanda… In front of the congregation—in spring and summer, autumn and winter—he perambulates the green carpet like old people sometimes do, as if on the deck of a ship on a rolling sea. He wears a turquoise bolo, somewhere between groovy and huh? His face is still elastic, the zygomatic muscles reflexively drawing his mouth into that smile, but his voice sometimes turns phlegmy without notice—and he starts coughing. His mind is a churning thing of wonder. His recall is sharp, his barbs of humor unexpected.",0
1443929394544881670,Jimmy Carter is fucking ancient and still doing construction work and liberals are still drooling over GWB fucking painting,"The answer: Learn to get along with each other in a peaceful way, to accommodate our human differences. “Would you agree with that?” asks Mr. Jimmy. Peace and difference, together. Unless you can imagine it, he says, the human race is probably kaput. A few years back, it appeared as if Mr. Jimmy was kaput, too, when the doctors found cancer on his liver and four tumors on his brain. At the time, he thought he only had weeks left and was filled not with sorrow, really, but great equanimity. Somehow, with treatment, he lived. Does anyone dare ask why? While Mr. Jimmy is still flickering, there are those who want to bask in the last of what he represents—a lost democratic tradition, civil discourse, moral rectitude—that lights a way out of this present-day mess. Is it possible to escape? That's why we come to Mr. Jimmy now: to find out. If one were to judge by the sustained Sunday crowds, Maranatha Baptist Church has turned into an unlikely American pilgrimage site. Perhaps we're afflicted by a deeper national need, or lack, the kind that inspires searchers to travel hundreds, sometimes thousands, of miles and begin lining up in the dark, but it raises a bunch of personal and collective questions. After all, soul-searching is a by-product of having temporarily lost one's soul. On one of my Sunday visits, last November, I arrived around 4:30 A.M. and was handed a scrap of paper with the number 15 scrawled on it, meaning I was 15th in line. The man doing the handing out was named George, dressed in blue slacks and a checked shirt with a red ball cap on his head. He said that some Sundays, if you're not there four or five hours ahead of time, you don't get in. The Sunday after Mr. Jimmy announced he had cancer, in August 2015, 1,800 people came to Plains, beginning to queue on Saturday night. (The highway patrol shut down the road out front; Mr. Jimmy did two lessons, one in a nearby auditorium, and still they turned people away.) Today, George had arrived at his usual time, around 4 A.M., to find a young man—twitchy, half-awake, and chilled—in a suit, no tie, white shirt, standing out there on the front porch of the church in the dark, here to see Mr. Jimmy before it's too late. Everything at that hour seemed special in Plains to someone coming from the North, as I had. George's honeyed drawl, for one. And the silence was special, in the hour when the Muscogee ghosts give up night on the southern coastal plain, and everything is deep and still. George had his eye on the special sky now, scanning the canopy of stars. “Last week we saw it three times,” he said. “We won't see it again for about ten days.” He was talking about the International Space Station, which you could track with an app on your phone. On his phone, too, George showed some pictures of yesterday's fishing trip with Mr. Jimmy. No artifice, no braggadocio: just another fishing trip with Mr. Jimmy—who you can almost forget is ex-president of the United States down here—to add to the others.",0

And the occasional luminaries he brought, too: Menachem Begin had been here, and Anwar Sadat. When Yasser Arafat visited, the mayor gave him a key to the city, and Arafat kissed him on both cheeks. (“I don't think our mayor has ever gotten over the kiss,” says Mr. Jimmy.) When the president of Bolivia came, the delegation played soccer with a local high school team. According to Mr. Jimmy, Christina Aguilera was supposed to come, but there was a travel snafu. (“I'm disappointed her plane didn't get in,” he says.) Putin hasn't made it yet, either, but Mr. Jimmy has his personal e-mail. They like to fish the same stream in Russia. Somewhere around 6 A.M., more cars began to sluice into the parking lot for Mr. Jimmy's 10 A.M. class. George greeted each new arrival with a slightly crumpled numbered piece of paper. In came Wilmington, North Carolina. In came Seattle, Washington. In came Pennsylvania and Virginia and Jamaica. George told them that the line would form outside the church at 7:45 A.M., that the Secret Service would do its scannings and checks, and that Miss Jan, his wife, would give a briefing at 9 A.M. The lot filled, the sun rose, sky was a mottle of clouds and blue nitrogen. The young man in the suit paced on the porch. People got out of their cars and stretched, walked down the highway to a big smiling-peanut statue in front of a convenience store, where they could get some Styrofoam-cup coffee. Others loitered on the lawn. One guy, a farmer from Pennsylvania, said, “A lot of people said, ‘You're coming down here to go to church?’ I said, ‘Yeah. I'm coming down to hear a former U.S. president talk about something that's important to him in a group of about 300 people and then stick around for pictures afterwards.’ ” A woman from Oregon said, “This couple here”—referring to Mr. Jimmy and his wife, Rosalynn—“are probably the closest couple of people that you'll find that walks the walk of the disciples. That's incredible in this day and age, this modern age. What they've done, what they do, it's incredible.” “It smacks you in the face how polar opposite the current [president] is,” said another. “It just jumps out at you and says, ‘This is how it's supposed to be.’ ” “I have a fairly good friend in the White House,” Mr. Jimmy said, then deadpanned, “Just one. I have to admit, it’s not the president.” The twitchy kid in the suit said he was going to college in Washington, D.C. He took the last flight of the day to Atlanta, then Ubered two and a half hours to Plains and started waiting at 3 A.M. “I thought it'd be cool,” he said. And the ride only cost about $150, much less than he'd expected. Some visitors confessed that this had always been on their bucket list, and, well, who knew how much longer Mr. Jimmy would be around? 1 At first, I was a bit afraid to admit I wasn't necessarily here to get closer to Jesus but, feeling bereft at the country we've become, had come looking for uplift. George told us that the Carters recently had a hill across the road from their house landscaped, marked for their eventual grave sites. Everyone shook their heads solemnly, not wanting to imagine it. Later, inside the church, Miss Jan greeted the gathered pilgrims. She was a short, commanding, wisecracking woman with a sassafras shrub of gray hair. She'd once lived in Washington, acting as “governess” for the youngest of the Carters' four children, Amy, who now, at 50, has two sons of her own and is a classroom aide at a school in Atlanta. Miss Jan told us how happy she was to see us and that we were not to “get cute” when Mr. Jimmy came in. “Some of you are going to stop breathing, almost,” she said. “So amazed that this man is here.”",0
1443929394544881670,Jimmy Carter is fucking ancient and still doing construction work and liberals are still drooling over GWB fucking painting,"Our America, as summed up recently by The New York Times, is a place where “life expectancy has declined, suicide rates have risen, the opioid crisis has worsened, inequality has grown, and confidence in government has fallen.” But our democracy has survived ragged, if not broken, times before. In 1971 the Times asked in a headline, IS AMERICA FALLING APART? Then put a fine point on it: “America is a prewar country, psychologically unprepared for one thing to go wrong,” wrote Anthony Burgess. “Now everything [seems] to be going wrong. Hence the neurosis, despair, the Kafka feeling that the whole marvelous fabric of American life is coming apart at the seams.” If we were fully unraveling in 1971, what was 1974, then? What were 1776 and 1862? We were coming apart at the seams in 1929 and 1942, 1963 and 2001. It's possible we've been coming apart since our inception. Perhaps it's a shortcoming of our American imagination, or national narcolepsy—and part of our volcanic creation story, too—to believe that this moment, right now, may be the worst moment ever, over and over and over again. If we forget other dysfunctional presidents, from John Quincy Adams and John Tyler to LBJ and Nixon, we might believe that this president is the most irrational, unstable, and narcissistic of all. The potential split atom of our democracy forever threatens to be our annihilation. But it doesn't mitigate these times to say there have been times like them before. It only begs the question: To whom might we appeal, or where might we find not just a voice of reason but one to remind us that—despite division and gun violence, deep-seated issues of race and class—the experiment is still worthy and vital? “Do I have any kinfolk here today?” he asked. A man raised his hand. “You a kin to me? We’ll have to fish together.” Perhaps this is why people come to Plains. Because to gaze upon Jimmy Carter, to look upon a face marked by time—the charismatic handsomeness of his 50s has softened, hollowed, and transformed into the weatherworn visage of his 90s—is to see someone shorn of ambition, trying to tell a truth, or his truth. Somewhere inside the man we knew as president, there's always been Mr. Jimmy, the seeker, who over time grew in concentration, no longer caring for our approval but, in a weird way, for the state of our national soul. If he was once criticized as a politician for being egomaniacal or sanctimonious, it's easier, with his presidency in the deep past, to accept Jimmy Carter as a human being whose heart might have always been in the right place. In church, teaching from the Bible, Mr. Jimmy becomes to his followers the purest distillation, then, of some post-presidency ideal, some secular saint. On the hallway bulletin board are pinned pictures of community events, the Carters beaming with locals. The butterfly garden out back was built by Rosalynn. And at these Sunday-school meetings, her husband steadies our twitchiness in singsong tones, with a personal psalm of history, Bible study, current events, and autobiography. “There's no way to separate completely the responsibilities of public service and also some basic moral and ethical principles on which we base the finest aspects of our life,” Mr. Jimmy says, “and we cure the problems in our society.” He likes to quote a favorite theologian, Reinhold Niebuhr, who said, “The sad duty of politics is to establish justice in a sinful world.” Carter says, for better or worse, he tried. In the Oval Office every morning before beginning his day's work, he would stand before the huge globe situated by the Resolute desk and touch his finger on Moscow, trying to put himself in Brezhnev's shoes. He would think: How can I not provoke him today?",0
1443929394544881670,Jimmy Carter is fucking ancient and still doing construction work and liberals are still drooling over GWB fucking painting,"“We never shot a bullet, we never dropped a bomb, we never launched a missile,” says Mr. Jimmy of his time in office. It's a fact he's proud of, especially given that since World War II, America's been at war with about 20 countries. China, on the other hand, hasn't been in a major war since 1979. “What they have done is to use their enormous resources to benefit their own people,” he says. “China has 14,000 miles of fast-speed rail.” Look at the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, he tells us one Sunday morning: “Thirty little, tiny paragraphs that you can read over in five minutes.… A lot of them are not being honored by our country in particular.… That's why we have wars today. All of those 30 paragraphs guarantee that women and men should have equal pay and equal opportunity for advancement and equal rights.… We have a long way to go.” If we as a nation suffer from thin-skinned righteousness, or ideological arrogance, he says he himself has suffered the sins of pride, thinking himself superior at times—to women, to those of different background. He's not proud of this in the least, but he has the courage to admit it. “Who decided whether you'd be kind or filled with hatred?” he asks on another morning. “Who decided whether you would forgive other people or not? Who decided whether you'd be honest and tell the truth or not? Who decided whether you would be generous or not? Who decided whether you'd be filled with love or not?” Then he answers his own questions: “Every one of us,” says Mr. Jimmy, “has our own free decision to answer the question This is the kind of person I'm going to be. It's not a decision that your parents can make for you, or your wife can make for you, or your husband or your friends. Everybody in here has the right to decide This is the kind of person I'm going to be. And if you haven't been the kind of person that you are proud of so far, you're free from now on the rest of your life to correct your mistakes.” He loves to quote his schoolteacher Miss Julia, who oft repeated, “We must accommodate changing times but cling to unchanging principles.” It's true of us in our private lives and true in public lives. It's true, too, when we think about the life of our town or state or nation. This is how it begins, actually, today. With this goodness, change, and hope, of which Mr. Jimmy speaks. He loves to quote his schoolteacher Miss Julia, who oft repeated, “We must accommodate changing times but cling to unchanging principles.” Mr. Jimmy asks for people to characterize in a word this moment we live in, under this president. “Confused,” someone shouts. “Twitter,” yells another. Divided, angry, crazy… Once the floodgate opens, people can't stop—reactionary, frightening, embarrassing…—but Mr. Jimmy eventually brings it to a shush. “How many of you have faith that our country can survive this despicable situation and come out okay?” There's a caesura, and then all the hands in the congregation go up. It surprises and overwhelms even Mr. Jimmy a little. “If you don't mind,” he says, “I'm going to put that in my book.” An American apotheosis is often built on a humbling downfall, and Jimmy Carter has his, too, of course. He came to the presidency as one of the longest long shots in history: With only 2 percent name recognition when he began his primary run, he eventually won 50.1 percent of the national vote to defeat incumbent Gerald Ford. After four tumultuous years, he found himself as widely disliked as almost any president in history. His 34 percent approval rating upon exit was the same as George W. Bush's, according to Gallup; the only modern presidents more hated were Nixon and Truman.",0
1443929394544881670,Jimmy Carter is fucking ancient and still doing construction work and liberals are still drooling over GWB fucking painting,"In Carter's case, despite the triumph of a Middle East peace agreement and the normalization of relations with China, despite his claim of having the second-highest success rate of initiatives passed in Congress (LBJ was the first), he was blamed for crippling stagflation, a fuel crisis that led to epic gas-station lines, and a kind of Black Mirror episode in which a grumpy Iranian imam halfway around the world seemed to hold not just 52 Americans but an entire nation, including its president, hostage. Carter so worried over the hostages in Iran that he proclaimed they were the first thing he thought about in the morning when he woke and the last thing he thought about at night during the 444 days of their captivity. To make matters worse, a failed rescue attempt left eight American servicemen dead in the Iranian desert.2 The Carter presidency (1977 to 1981) is partially remembered—and lampooned—for this very afterimage of ineffectuality, of a leaf man lost in the forest with a command for minute details but whose overweening morality eventually left him without political bite or guile. His religiosity also confused people. As the first president from a southern, evangelical-Christian tradition to talk about being “born again,” he was, according to E. J. Dionne Jr., treated by the press as “some sort of Martian.”3 Surrounded by his “Georgia Mafia,” the group of advisers who'd helped make him governor of that state, Carter rode into Washington on a populist wave, as an outsider—and remained one. He took a dim view of Congress, at one point calling the members “juvenile delinquents.” A claim that came to define Carter's microscopy was that, given all the crises in the world, the president himself controlled the sign-up sheet for the White House tennis court. (Carter eventually had to deny the detail.4) The toothy smile, the oversharing,5 Billy the beer-swilling brother, and a crazed swamp rabbit that seemed to muster an attack on the president as he fished—they all made for good punch lines. Though the true Carter was much more complicated, a combination, as described by historian Garry Wills, of “ferocious tenderness, the detached intimacy, the cooing which nonetheless suggests a proximity of lions.” His mean streak included an intense dislike for Ted Kennedy, blaming the senator for denying him a comprehensive health-care bill. In retrospect, there's much about the Carter presidency that was shaped by externalities—in particular the Iranian revolution that was at the root of both the second oil crisis and the hostage-taking in 1979—and yet Carter's response to both, epitomized in his famous “Crisis of Confidence” speech on July 15 of that year, was a withering sort of critique. In that address, he famously condemned our American addiction to stuff, our materialism and consumerism. “Too many of us now tend to worship self-indulgence and consumption,” he told us. He called for car pools, thermostats set lower, and obeyance of the speed limit not just as acts of common sense but of patriotism. To watch that speech now is to witness a very unusual sort of political mixing of morality, religion, and country frugality. (It seems telling that people misremember the speech as having been delivered in a cardigan sweater, rather than the suit and tie Carter wore.) Afterward, the White House switchboard lit up, allegedly with callers applauding the president. And yet judging by the reaction to that speech over time—including the election of Ronald Reagan—apparently what we craved was a different kind of bedtime story to solve our problems, not Carter's strict-daddy austerity measures, ones that included solar panels on the White House. And yet the polls were still even on the Friday before Election Day, 1980; only in the waning moments of the campaign did Reagan's brand provide the more powerful elixir. You can watch the aftermath on YouTube: Carter leaving Washington on Inauguration Day and flying back to Plains with Rosalynn, emerging in cold January rain to huge crowds. Here he is, then: 56 years old, and in the footage he sees his mother, Lillian, to whom he confesses he hasn't slept in two nights, in a flurry of last-minute negotiations to free the hostages. He is home, among his friends and family, and yet there's an air of exhaustion and melancholy. (“Allowing Ronald Reagan to become president,” he said later, “was by far my biggest failure in office.”) Prior to the presidency, he'd owned a prosperous peanut business, but due to mismanagement, he's recently found out he's over $1 million in debt. Not the most auspicious start to a post-presidency. At the time, America was mostly done with Jimmy Carter. We apparently were unconvinced by his wagging finger, by his stubbornness, by his inability to effectively address the big challenges of the day. Our stature in the world seemed much diminished. He himself talks about his former “arrogance,” that he thought he possessed all the answers somehow. But we kept waiting for Godot to show up—and when he didn't, we turned the page with some disgust. Ronald Reagan brought his California movie-star wattage and conservative duende, and, like that, after a four-year interlude from the Nixonian nadir, the Republican party was seemingly resurrected and would run the table for the next 12 years. Carter's last significant cameo was a visit with the released hostages in Germany at Reagan's behest, one that left him moved and shaken. Then he retreated to write his memoirs from the 5,000 diary pages he'd kept during his White House years, and to pay back his debts. As summer gave way to fall in Plains, and fall to winter, as winter relented to spring and the plums, figs, and sugarberries came back around, the cars kept pulling into the lot at Maranatha Baptist, greeted by George, who kept one eye on the heavens, looking for the Space Station. Back in February, Rosalynn took ill—“very, very ill” was how Mr. Jimmy had it. It had to do with her “insides,” repercussions from an operation years ago, and required another operation, from which recovery was slow and arduous. Mr. Jimmy was going up to Atlanta twice a week to see her and abide with her and spend the night. Even he seemed a little more wobbly on his feet now, even more elfin with age. Sometimes Miss Jan set up a chair nearby that he never used, or a glass of water. He appeared from the wings at 10 A.M. each Sunday, flashing that disarming smile, and those hooded ice-blue eyes, the full effect of which, when he registers surprise or joy, was startling, almost boyish. He spread the notes he never referred to on the podium, saying, “Good morning, everyone!” Beaming back at him were Connecticut and Arizona, a family from England, scatterlings from Taiwan, Japan, Scotland, Congo. “Do I have any kinfolk here today?” he asked. A man raised his hand. “You a kin to me? We'll have to fish together.” Then he was off again, musing about those statues of Confederate war heroes, whether they should be torn down: “When I see a statue of a soldier from the Confederate side, I feel like I might admire it because it might represent my grandparents.” Or sounding a little like Bernie Sanders, repeating beliefs he's held long before we bothered listening to Bernie Sanders. “Today if you can't raise $200 million, you can't be the nominee,” he said, “and it costs $1 billion by the two candidates once they get done running. We've become an oligarchy ruled by wealth rather than a true democracy.” On a Sunday before Christmas, he claimed he'd just been on his last quail hunt. He was down in Leesburg with friends and noticed, while walking through the woods, that his balance was off. Rather than endanger anyone, he knew his shooting days were over. “I had to give up running when I was 80 years old, so age catches up with everybody,” he said. When did Jimmy Carter forgive us? The answer to that was simple: The first day Mr. Jimmy, a citizen again, invited us all back to Plains, Georgia, for Sunday school, the day his ex-presidency began in earnest. In March, he reminded us that he was cancer-free. Maybe he could go on forever. So much was happening so quickly now: North Korea, Syria, Iran, Russian meddling, trade wars and porn stars, stock-market roller coaster, etc. He'd been in Egypt and met with the grand imam. He'd huddled with a White House official to brief him on the North Korea situation. (“I have a fairly good friend in the White House,” he said, then deadpanned, “Just one. I have to admit, it's not the president.”) He'd recently sent a message to Putin, telling him that with the help of Google they'd constructed a “map of belligerence in Syria.” He wondered if Putin himself would be “interested in having it so he would bomb the right people.” Here we were, then, humans evolved to a high point, an apex, trying to kill each other, both figuratively and literally. To inoculate myself, I'd tried to boycott the news, but then couldn't. It seemed to boil down to a peculiar choice at this moment, between being apoplectic or apathetic. Was there a medical diagnosis for the national diminishment of hope? And on Sunday, Mr. Jimmy stood up in front of the world as it arrived to Plains—speaking before some sort of unspoken resistance movement—and calmly kept right on teaching his lessons. On the last Sunday I was in the crowd, Mr. Jimmy was talking about Tolstoy's War and Peace. He was wondering if any of us had read it, and an uncertain hand or two went up. “It's about ordinary people,” Mr. Jimmy said with a flash of excitement. “The message I got from it was that even in Russia, that was controlled by an emperor, it was the common, ordinary people that shaped the outcome of the major historical events. And if that's true in a country that's had an emperor, who was a dictator, it must be true in our country. You see, that's the transition that I want us to make this morning. We, individual citizens [in] a democracy, we are the ones that determine what kind of country we have.”",0
1443929394544881670,Jimmy Carter is fucking ancient and still doing construction work and liberals are still drooling over GWB fucking painting,"Afterward, at the nearby cafeteria, a fellow attendee—California—asked a group of us, “When did you forgive Jimmy Carter?” I understood the gist of the question—when did the failures of his presidency resolve into a higher regard for this citizen sainthood of his, if that's what it is? But it seemed reverse to me. I was thinking about that Friday before the 1980 election, when the polls showed Carter and Reagan in a dead heat. We voted for the bedtime story, then, eight years, plus four more under Bush, that led to deeper class and race divides, to the rich getting much richer while the poor got much poorer. To me, the more accurate question might have been: When did Jimmy Carter forgive us? And the answer to that was simple: The first day Mr. Jimmy, a citizen again, invited us all back to Plains, Georgia, for Sunday school, the day his ex-presidency began in earnest. Four decades later, Mr. Jimmy was still flickering: He mowed the lawn at the church, and weeded, and because he favors woodworking, Mr. Jimmy has made the cross that hangs in the sanctuary, and the collection plates, and a table. Here was a man of peace, who was betting on the long arc of history, for us to be saved from ourselves again. If a president embodies a certain aspect of our country in any given moment, then you could look back and see now that Mr. Jimmy was the goodness of what we could be, the betterment. If he'd come to the presidency as a public servant, he was going to die one, too. His most important speeches were now given at 10 A.M., at Maranatha Baptist Church, and those lined no one's pockets. Maybe the example Mr. Jimmy had set, in retrospect, is that the presidency itself isn't a brand, after all. And that he wasn't an accident of history, either, wasn't just a four-year pendulum swing away from Nixon. Perhaps he'd been sent to carry his own message, campaigning for an idea that the greatest strength lies in humbling ourselves before one another. Peace and difference, together. His personal life is in shambles, Robert Mueller looms large, and it's never been trickier to be the president's son. When it came time to hire Brandon, the 24-year-old pastor, Mr. Jimmy sat with everyone else from church at a long table in the cafeteria and, over fried chicken, collard greens, and sweet tea, asked questions and listened. They hired Brandon, and the young pastor still remembers a small moment that says everything, he thinks. It was a Sunday night back at the church recently, after the morning's Sunday-school teaching by Mr. Jimmy, and the service, and lunch, after another afternoon and evening event. It was 8 P.M., and only a few people were left at Maranatha, when all of a sudden the Secret Service swooped in. Out of a black car popped Mr. Jimmy, one arm in a sling from a minor mishap, clutching a hammer. “President Carter,” said Brandon, “what are you doing?” “The door needs fixing,” said Mr. Jimmy, smiling. He gamboled over, did some pounding and hammering, made a fair bit of noise. Then he turned and teetered across the yard. As quickly as he'd materialized, he was gone, in a black car carrying him back along the familiar streets of Plains, back to Rosalynn and the same old appliances and Formica countertops of home.

Looking for discretionary budget items he could cut to save money, he was influenced by a paper written by Stuart Eizenstat [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_E._Eizenstat ], the head of his domestic policy staff, and Kathy Fletcher [ http://www.historylink.org/File/9369 ], one of his staff scientists. “There is no coherent federal water resources management policy … extensive overlap of agency activities … several million acres of productive agricultural land, forest land and commercial and sports fisheries ruined while other large expenditures have been made to protect these same resources … large scale destruction of natural ecosystems … pork barrel … self serving … special interests” and the like.

1443929394544881670,Jimmy Carter is fucking ancient and still doing construction work and liberals are still drooling over GWB fucking painting,"Congress went fucking ballistic.

Words like “dastardly”, incredible”, “incomprehensible” and “infamous” filled the pages of the Congressional Record. Even Morris Udall of Arizona, who a few days before had written to Carter supporting his policy to “halt construction of unnecessary and environmentally destructive dams”, turned against him when his own pet project, the CAP, was on the block. Even the press, which had long been filled with criticism of wasteful public works projects - so long as they were in someone else’s district - turned on Carter. He invited the Congressional leadership to the White House to discuss it. According to contemporary reports, “It was like a lynch mob. He was the sheriff throwing calm facts at them, but they kept yelling at him to release the projects. … They were rude. They interrupted him. And most of them belonged to his own party.”",0

Instead he started applying economic arguments to other water projects. Simply by reassessing their budgets with an interest rate of 6.75% he could show that not 19, but eighty projects deserved to be cancelled because they would cost far more than the economic benefit they returned. VP Mondale talked some sense into him and reluctantly Carter whittled the list back down to 18 projects, omitting some of the more politically contentious items. The House Appropriations Committee then issued its 1978 Public Works Appropriations bill in which all but one of the projects on Carter’s hit list were generously funded, a dozen new pork barrel projects were added, and the Florida Barge Canal, a project previously cancelled by Richard Nixon, was reinstated. Carter decided to veto it, and sent his staff off to lobby Congress furiously to collect enough votes to prevent a Congressional override. Working against him were the federal Bureau of Reclamation and the Army Corps of Engineers, both of which depended on water projects to meet payroll. By the fall, Carter’s staff had twisted enough arms and cajoled enough reluctant votes and worked out enough of a compromise to avoid an override.

It was actually 90% complete in 1969 when the National Environmental Policy Act was passed, which required projects like this so carry out an environmental impact study. The TVA claimed it was exempt from the NEPA, but a court disagreed and work was held up for several years, until it ran foul of the Endangered Species Act of 1973. To cut a long story short, the Supreme Court found against the TVA and ordered work stopped. Meanwhile, an economic study had found that the dam, once completed, wouldn’t even generate enough revenue to repay the cost of completing it. It looked doomed. But then on a quiet night in 1979 James Duncan, a Congressman whose district covered the dam, walked into Congress and presented an amendment to the appropriations bill. Tom Bevill and John Myers, both members of the appropriations committee, rose to second the amendment and it was adopted by voice vote in a nearly deserted chamber where nobody except the three sponsors even knew what the amendment did. It exempted the Tellico Dam from all laws. The Supreme Court finding was of null effect.

Some enterprising science teacher figured out that putting a wet paper towel over the thermostat system would force the heat to go up, but it would also burn out the thermostat “sensor.” And so it went with Carter’s 4 years in office.

The Shah in Iran and the Samoza regime in Nicaragua fell in a year when the USA appeared unable to check the military influence of the USSR. Simultaneously, Cuba was sending troops abroad to Africa to support revolutionary movements. Carter made the USA look unwilling and/or unable to fight in the Cold War for political friends and neutral neighbors. This might have been the high road and in sync with the values that most Americans held dear—that we really should not support dictators or colonialism—but it limited the administration's power to deter the Soviets from exercising their muscles.

The president focused, such as in the case of inflation, on the microeconomic problems as opposed to macroeconomics. The author suggests that Carter preferred problems of a micro-nature where less of a chance existed for political or other outside entanglements. Biven quotes government officials that suggest that the president, due to his background in engineering, remained too wedded to minute details.

In many ways, Mr. Carter is a humble man, but not when it comes to his intelligence. Over time, that tends to be overbearing and off-putting. Instead of having a group around him where everyone gives input and the President makes a decision based on their input and his own ideas, Mr. Carter, as I've been told, tended to not be very good at acting as if the input of others was valuable.

1443888026070003716,Nancy Pelosi is a trifling bitch,"Casting about for a short, easily understood description of Donald Trump's conduct vis-à-vis Ukraine, House Democrats seem to have settled on bribery. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), speaking to reporters yesterday, said ""the devastating testimony"" heard by the House Intelligence Committee during impeachment hearings this week ""corroborated evidence of bribery uncovered in the inquiry.""",0
1443888026070003716,Nancy Pelosi is a trifling bitch,"The word bribery has a few obvious advantages. It is specifically mentioned in the Constitution as an example of the ""high crimes and misdemeanors"" that justify impeachment; it is the offense that most readily springs to mind when people think about public corruption; and it (initially, at least) avoids potential confusion about the meaning and significance of the ""quid pro quo"" that Republicans deny and Democrats think is obvious. ""After weeks of describing the president's actions as a 'quid pro quo,'"" The New York Times reports, ""lawmakers are looking for a more straightforward and digestible way to describe what happened to their constituents.""",0
1443888026070003716,Nancy Pelosi is a trifling bitch,"But describing Trump's actions as bribery also poses problems as a communications strategy. Trump is accused of withholding benefits—military aid and a White House meeting—from Ukraine to pressure its government into launching (or at least announcing) investigations that would be politically useful to him. That sounds a lot like extortion, especially since the military aid had already been approved by Congress and would have been delivered on schedule if Trump had not blocked it.",0
1443888026070003716,Nancy Pelosi is a trifling bitch,"Pelosi herself, in explaining why Trump is guilty of bribery, ended up describing extortion. ""The president abused his power and violated his oath by threatening to withhold military aid and a White House meeting"" if Ukraine failed to launch ""an investigation into his political rival,"" Pelosi said, calling that ""a clear attempt by the president to give himself an advantage in the 2020 election.""",0
1443888026070003716,Nancy Pelosi is a trifling bitch,"As George Mason law professor Ilya Somin notes, there is a federal extortion statute that seems to fit these facts pretty well. 18 USC 1601 applies to someone who ""knowingly causes or attempts to cause any person to make a contribution of a thing of value (including services) for the benefit of any candidate or any political party, by means of the denial or deprivation, or the threat of the denial or deprivation, of…any payment or benefit of a program of the United States"" if that payment or benefit ""is provided for or made possible in whole or in part by an Act of Congress.""",0
1443888026070003716,Nancy Pelosi is a trifling bitch,"Pushing the bribery angle, Pelosi said ""the bribe is to grant or withhold military assistance in return for a public statement of a fake investigation into the elections."" That makes it sound like Trump is accused of bribing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. But federal bribery laws apply to American officials, not foreign officials, so the relevant question is not whether Trump tried to bribe Zelenskiy but whether he solicited a bribe from Zelenskiy.",0
1443888026070003716,Nancy Pelosi is a trifling bitch,"If Democrats are determined to frame Trump's actions as bribery, the most obviously germane statute is 18 USC 201, which applies to any federal official who ""corruptly…seeks…anything of value…in return for…being influenced in the performance of any official act."" In this case, the ""thing of value"" would be an investigation of Joe Biden and his son, and the official acts would be unblocking the military aid and scheduling a White House meeting. That's not entirely implausible, but the extortion statute seems like a more natural fit.",0
1443888026070003716,Nancy Pelosi is a trifling bitch,"Either way, the Democrats cannot avoid talking about a quid pro quo, since that is an essential element of both crimes. A bribery conviction under 18 USC 201, the Supreme Court has said, requires ""a quid pro quo—a specific intent to give or receive something of value in exchange for an official act."" Under 18 USC 1601, the deprivation of benefits likewise has to be aimed at ""caus[ing]"" the victim to contribute a ""thing of value.""",0
1443888026070003716,Nancy Pelosi is a trifling bitch,"Whether you think of Trump's actions as extortion, solicitation of a bribe, or simply a troubling abuse of power that does not necessarily violate any criminal statutes, the connection between military aid (or a White House meeting) and the politically beneficial investigations is crucial. To my mind, that link has been established pretty clearly by the rough transcript of Trump's July 25 telephone conversation with Zelenskiy and by the testimony of administration officials. Others may disagree. But the question of whether there was a quid pro quo remains at the heart of the debate.",0
1443888026070003716,Nancy Pelosi is a trifling bitch,"Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has officially called for articles of impeachment to be drawn up against President Donald Trump, making him just the third chief executive to be thus called on the carpet. (Richard Nixon would have been the fourth, but he resigned before the House voted on articles of impeachment.)",0
1443888026070003716,Nancy Pelosi is a trifling bitch,"In her brief remarks, Pelosi, who many Trump opponents had criticized for dragging her heels on impeachment, invoked the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution while saying that House hearings have established that the president abused the power of his office for personal gain and obstructed congressional investigations.",0
1443888026070003716,Nancy Pelosi is a trifling bitch,"The facts are uncontested. The president abused his power for his own personal political benefit at the expense of our national security, by withholding military aid and crucial Oval Office meeting in exchange for an announcement of an investigation into his political rival…. His wrongdoing strikes at the very heart of our constitution. A separation of powers, three co-equal branches, each a check and balance on the other.",0
1443888026070003716,Nancy Pelosi is a trifling bitch,You can watch Pelosi's full statement below (she appears around the 30-minute mark):,0
1443888026070003716,Nancy Pelosi is a trifling bitch,"For his part, Donald Trump prebutted the announcement with a pair of tweets calling for a ""fast"" and ""fair"" trial in the Senate:",0
1443888026070003716,Nancy Pelosi is a trifling bitch,"This momentous occasion demands that we think outside of our partisan affiliations and the current hyperpolarized scene. Impeachment is always and everywhere a political act. As Gerald Ford, then a Republican congressman from Michigan, said in the years before Watergate brought down Richard Nixon, an impeachable offense is ""whatever a majority of the House of Representatives considers to be at a given moment in history.""",0
1443888026070003716,Nancy Pelosi is a trifling bitch,"So it's good to see Pelosi invoking the Constitution's call for a balance of powers among the branches of the federal government. There is no question that the executive branch has been too powerful for decades and it's long past due that Congress assert its role as what Sen. Mike Lee (R–Utah) has called the ""first among the federal government's three co-equal branches."" Not surprisingly, Lee and other Republicans seem less interested in reining the president when the White House is occupied by a fellow representative of the GOP.",0
1443888026070003716,Nancy Pelosi is a trifling bitch,"But precisely because it is so fully a political act, impeachment is one of the worst ways to rebalance the branches of government. For all of the 21st century and much of the 20th, Congress has abdicated its role in all sorts of ways. It has not passed timely and balanced budgets; it has not insisted on a declaration of war before U.S. troops go into battle; it has given the executive branch carte blanche to create an unaccountable administrative state in which bureaucrats write and enforce their own rules.",0
1443888026070003716,Nancy Pelosi is a trifling bitch,"Whether or not Donald Trump is removed from office—and whether or not he deserves to be—the impeachment process is likely to exacerbate partisanship and the worst sort of short-term thinking. In the current climate, results will be less about enduring structural reforms than how to get payback in the next election cycle. When George W. Bush was president and flouting any restraints on his power, the Democrats were up in arms—until Barack Obama was elected, and then the sides switched. For a brief, shining moment after Trump beat Hillary Clinton, liberals fretted that the executive power they lauded when Obama wielded it was a terrible, terrible thing. As they sniff victory in 2020, those concerns have once again faded.",0
1443888026070003716,Nancy Pelosi is a trifling bitch,"There is a strong, principled, libertarian case that we don't impeach presidents as often as we should. In fact, Gene Healy of the Cato Institute made that argument in 2017 and will be making an expanded version of it in an upcoming issue of Reason. But that is not the case that is being made now by House Democrats.",0
1443888026070003716,Nancy Pelosi is a trifling bitch,"Even as she invokes George Mason to defend impeachment—the founder asked ""Shall any man be above justice?"" while making the case to include a means of removing presidents who acted like kings—it's hard to believe that Nancy Pelosi and her fellow Democrats aren't simply engaging in mere politics to remove an opponent who they fear will win reelection. For god's sake, some Democrats were talking about impeaching Trump before he even took office and Hillary Clinton still can't admit he won. Similarly, it's impossible not to accuse Republicans of bad faith when they rush to defend actions by Trump that they denounced under Obama. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R–Ky.) was the guy who famously said that his party's only legislative goal was to make Barack Obama a one-term president (as with budget restraint, the GOP failed miserably).",0
1443888026070003716,Nancy Pelosi is a trifling bitch,"Until congressional leaders can credibly show that they will enforce the same standards of behavior on their fellow party members, I think impeachment and similar actions will only pour gasoline on the dumpster fire that has been American politics for all of the 21st century. Rather than extinguishing the flames, it will turn up the heat. And those of us who stand outside of the lowest form of political tribalism will get burned.",0

I mean real fight films, the kind we used to make in Tinseltown when men were men instead of metrosexuals, films like: The Harder They Fall (1956), Bogey’s last picture, based on the Budd Schulberg novel about a Primo Carnera-like, glass-jawed palooka named Toro Moreno, who lets evil gangsters manipulate him and screw him out of his money and finally hangs him out to dry in the ring to get the tar whaled out of him, leaving him with nothing in the end. Standing in for the American media, Bogey plays a sleazy, down-at-the-heels press agent whose job it is to promote this tomato can, until even he can’t stomach the loss of — well, everything.",0

Maurice Sendak","In a corner office in the U.S. Capitol, a short stroll down the marble corridor from the room where Speaker of the House Jim Wright is writhing in a stew of ethics charges, the man who's put Wright in that fix seems quite out of sorts himself. ""I'm a controversial guy,"" Newt Gingrich says, with the air of a man who has discovered something surprising about himself. He isn't sure he should make himself available for a magazine story, explaining, ""I'm not up to speed on the national press."" It is an amazing assertion, coming from the congressman who once declared he was ""reshaping the entire nation through the news media,"" who just a week earlier had been quoted in Newsweek as saying, ""If you're not in The Washington Post every day, you might as well not exist."" Gingrich, Congress's own automated-teller machine of quotes, is not up to dealing with the press? Something is definitely wrong. In fact, it has been a terrible week for the chunky, forty-five-year-old Republican congressman from Georgia, and this is only Thursday afternoon. On Tuesday, The New York Times gave prominent display on its op-ed page to an article written by one of Gingrich's most bitter Democratic foes, Representative Bill Alexander of Arkansas, who branded Gingrich a neo-McCarthyite and urged his colleagues to take up the fight against him. Then Gingrich and his wife, Marianne, met with reporters to answer charges (filed by Alexander) of possible improprieties in an unusual book-promotion deal --improprieties loosely similar to those with which Gingrich has charged Speaker Wright. It was a difficult, testy news conference; the press couldn't resist probing the obvious parallels, and after just a few moments Marianne Gingrich stalked out of the press gallery, sobbing. The event landed Newt and Marianne Gingrich on the front page of Wednesday's Washington Post . Thursday is going downhill fast. It began with a morning meeting with House Republican officials in the office of Bob Michel, the minority leader. Gingrich discovered that four Democratic congressmen were asking the House ethics committee to appoint an outside counsel to investigate the charges against him. The next item on his schedule was a National Press Club luncheon, at which he was to be the featured guest. Marianne Gingrich was supposed to attend as well, but she had been so upset that she refused to accompany her husband. Now, when he returns to his office following the lunch, she is on the phone, in tears; a friend from Ohio has called, asking about an account of the press conference in the Cleveland Plain Dealer . ""He is a little testy today,"" says Sheila Ward, Gingrich's faithful young press aide, who has just earned a wicked blast of Gingrich ire for turning up the sound on an office television (tuned, appropriately enough, to C-SPAN, the public-service cable network that covers government). It was probably inevitable that Gingrich, himself an accomplished slinger would get splattered in Washington's current mud bath. Not only is he the man who put Jim Wright, the top Democrat in the country, on the spit, but his decade-long career in the House of Representatives has been one sustained assault on the opposition party --known in the Gingrich lexicon as ""the corrupt left-wing machine"" that exists to perpetuate ""the corrupt liberal welfare state."" Almost from the moment he arrived in town, Gingrich, who looks like Pete Rose (and, for that matter, plays Congress in the headfirst style in which Rose played baseball), has been practicing what he calls ""confrontational activism,"" a standard theme of which is the defeatist psychology of the Soviet-appeasing Chamberlains on the other side of the aisle. But even this is not why Newt Gingrich stands at center stage in the political theater just now. To many in Washington, both those who admire and those who loathe the Georgia representative, Newt Gingrich is the future of American politics, arrived; a hope, or a nightmare, come true. This spring, in an extraordinary jolt to the usually somnolent politics of House Republicans, Gingrich leapt from his niche as a back-bench bomb thrower to the post of minority whip, a key position in a party leadership. His ascension changes the chemistry of politics on Capitol Hill and signals a dramatic new Republican strategy. After thirty-four years as the minority party in Congress, years of deep frustration, the Republicans seem ready to launch an all-out war on Democratic dominance, attacking the Democratic Party as a whole with the same spectacularly successful (if ungentle) tactics that George Bush's campaign managers used against Michael Dukakis in 1988. The Bush campaign sank Dukakis by playing to the national gut --driving the public perception of the Democratic candidate to the far left with such devices as the Willie Horton ads, which portrayed Dukakis as being soft on crime by focusing on Massachusetts's prison-furlough program. (Horton, a scary-looking black man, raped a white woman while on a weekend leave from a Massachusetts prison.) The architect of that campaign, political consultant Lee Atwater, is now chairman of the Republican National Committee, and his former boss, political consultant Ed Rollins, is head of the National Republican Congressional Committee. Atwater was among the first to applaud Newt Gingrich's selection as whip: ""He talks the kinda talk I like."" It is clear that the Atwater-Rollins wing of the party, at least, intends Gingrich to be the Republicans' front man in the drive to do for all of the G.O.P. what Atwater did for George Bush--to ""Willie Horton"" the Democratic House of Representatives by hammering away at the theme of ""institutional corruption."" ""I think Newt Gingrich has an opportunity to have a somewhat unprecedented role for a Republican House member,"" Atwater says. ""He can truly be a national political guru for our party. He can be a spokesman, he can be a philosopher, and he can be a strategist for our party. As Teddy Roosevelt once said about the bully pulpit, Newt Gingrich has an opportunity to be as big a man as he can be."" Gingrich is eager for the role. By Saturday he has shaken off the setbacks of the news conference and the Democrats' attacks--""a smear campaign by Jim Wright's cronies""--and is pounding away once more at the ""corrupt left-wing machine."" He spends most of the day at Atwater's home, plotting strategy. His goal: a Republican majority by 1992. (""And the great thing about Gingrich,"" says Atwater, ""is that he really believes it."") That evening, after attending the White House correspondents dinner, Gingrich makes an appearance on a public-television talk show, where he says that God has given him a mission: ""To find honest self-government and to survive as a free people."" It will be hard for the Democrats to campaign against that. Not surprisingly, Gingrich has often been diminished by his colleagues in the House as a fast-talking demagogue, or worse. Beryl Anthony Jr. of Arkansas,the head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee says simply, ""He's crazy."" In 1985, The Washington Post wrote that ""Newt Gingrich may be just about the most disliked member of Congress."" Why, then, would Republicans choose him as a leader? Because he is a rare and compelling politician. In public meetings and speeches, Gingrich is an extremely engaging fellow. His defense of his book deal before the National Press Club (no pit bulls, but not exactly the Young Republicans, either) prompted thunderous applause. He takes complete possession of the room, even when he's speaking what one critic calls ""GobbledyNewt""--his philosophical mix of futurism, high technology, free enterprise, and space. A former college professor, he has the instructor's command, rather than the lawyer's equivocation, a compelling directness in a world of frayed smiles and glazed expressions. But most of all Gingrich has something that is of great practical value to the Republican just now --the zealot's single-minded drive. It is grounded in a childhood that was divided and rootless. He was born Newton Leroy McPherson near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, in 1943, his parents' only child. His father was in the navy, but his parents broke up after the war, and his mother married a career army officer, who adopted Newt when the youngster was five. Both of Gingrich's parents had children in their second marriages, and although Newt was an army brat, following his mother and stepfather from base to base, he stayed in touch with his natural father. Then, as a fifteen-year-old high school student in France, where his stepfather was stationed, Gingrich was ""called"" to politics. ""I got active in this business of politics and self-government in 1958, when my father, who was serving in the U.S. Army, took us to the battlefield of Verdun."" The boy stared at the bone pile left by the great battle, and ""over the course of the weekend, it convinced me that civilizations live and die by, and that the ultimate margin in a free society of our fate is provided more by, elected political leadership than by any other group. That in the end it's the elected politicians that decide where we fight and when we fight and what the terms of engagement are, and what weapons systems are available."" That awakening, he says, led to a 180-page term paper on the balance of world power. When he turned in the paper, he informed his teacher that his family was being transferred to Fort Benning, Georgia, where he would become a Republican congressman. It is a story that Gingrich tells at least three or four times a week. It is his self-explanation, his Genesis. It is possibly even true. Who would make up a story like that? In any case, Newt Gingrich was a driven lad by the time he arrived at Baxter High School, and politics was his passion --as a junior, he passed out campaign literature for Nixon's 1960 campaign. His singular determination was perhaps best seen in his first successful romance, a schoolboy crush he developed on his high-school math teacher. Lots of boys get romantic notions about pretty young teachers, but Newt Gingrich didn't let go of his. After graduation, when she moved to Atlanta, he went to Atlanta too, enrolling at Emory University. Gingrich pursued his former math teacher, seven years his senior, until Jackie agreed to become his wife. They were married at the end of his freshman year, and soon they had their first child, Kathy. Gingrich then entered that hazy passage through ambiguity experienced by the majority of young American men during the 1960s. Like most of his generation, Gingrich was moderately anti-Establishment (he tried pot, and participated in a campus protest at Tulane University) and chose not to go to Vietnam, opting for deferments available to him as a father and a student. But unlike most young men his age, Gingrich would be haunted by his decision. Later, when, as a hawkish congressman, he would lash out against the ""weak-on-defense left"" and espouse universal military training, his opponents would investigate Gingrich's own military background. Sure enough, he found himself listed among a sizable group of noted conservative hawks (including George Will and Richard Perle) who had managed to avoid the war-the ""war wimps,"" as they came to be called. In 1985, he told Jane Mayer of The Wall Street Journal that he still believed that ""Vietnam was the right battlefield at the right time."" Why didn't he go? ""Given everything I believe in, a large part of me thinks I should have gone over,"" he allowed. But, recovering, he added, ""Part of the question I had to ask myself was what difference I would have made."" After graduating from Emory, he and Jackie and Kathy moved to New Orleans, where the Gingriches had a second daughter, and Newt worked on his graduate degrees in history. He ultimately earned his Ph.D. from Tulane, but maintained his vivid interest in politics throughout. He took a year off in 1964 to manage a congressional campaign in Georgia and worked on Nelson Rockefeller's presidential quest in 1968. In 1970, Gingrich moved his family to Carrollton, a quiet town south of Atlanta, where he took a job teaching environmental studies. One of the things Gingrich liked about the job was its location-in Georgia's Sixth Congressional District, which Gingrich soon identified as the seat of his boyhood visions. The seat, which had been solidly Democratic since Reconstruction, was held by a longtime incumbent, Jack Flynt. Gingrich's first two campaigns, both against Flynt, were unsuccessful, but it was a measure of his political acumen that the races were even close. In 1974 he was hurt by Watergate and Gerald Ford's pardon of Richard Nixon-a political act that he later termed ""just unbelievably dumb. Gerald Ford personally cost me a Congressional seat...Just utterly stupid."" And in 1976 he was hurt by the presence at the top of the Democratic ticket of a native Georgian, Jimmy Carter. But Jack Flynt retired after his 1976 term, and 1978 was Gingrich's year. His Democratic opponent was Virginia Shapard, a state senator. The campaign was so rough that Shapard is still more than a little bitter about it. ""It was, early on, that same sort of technique that you saw in this last campaign at the presidential level,"" she says, ""the Willie Horton type of thing."" Gingrich, seeking to drive Shapard to the left and carve out the middle and right for himself, campaigned as a hard, no-tax, anti-welfare conservative. One Gingrich ad, which Shapard says was particularly effective, showed hands reaching out and grabbing at a pile of dollar bills-taxpayer dollars-""and this voice-over said, 'Virginia Shapard says she's against welfare fraud, but she voted against...' and then they cited the bill number, and it was absolutely devastating."" Another Gingrich theme in that campaign was moral leadership and family values. He drove the point home with an ad claiming that if Shapard were elected to Congress she would leave her husband, a local businessman, behind, while Gingrich would keep his family together. This issue was a subject of particular irony among the Shapard campaign staffers, where gossip about Gingrich's roving eye was widely believed and it was assumed that the Gingrich marriage was on the verge of breaking up. ""As the days dwindled down in the end of the campaign,"" Shapard says, ""the campaign workers had an unofficial pool going on to see how long it would take him when he got to Washington to dump [Jackie.]"" Not long, as it turned out. Jackie Gingrich went to Washington with her newly elected husband, but she did not return for his second term. She says that Gingrich walked out on her in the spring of 1980. That fall, while she was in the hospital recovering from surgery for uterine cancer, he appeared at her bedside with a yellow legal pad outlining the details for their divorce. The next year, he married his current wife, Marianne Ginther, a small-town Ohio woman fifteen years younger than Jackie, who was then a personnel clerk with the Secret Service. ""I was very fond of Jackie, and I felt sorry for the whole way that it turned out for her,"" Shapard says. ""But...you could have written that down before it happened, and many people did."" It's hard now for Jackie Gingrich to talk about her life with Newt. Her daughters are grown, and though she talks with them regularly by phone, Jackie lives alone in Carrollton, still teaching, and tutoring at night. She no longer has any contact with Gingrich whom she refers to as ""the congressman."" ""I do not talk to him, he does not talk to me, and I do not even get junk mail from the office."" In Washington, the second Mrs. Gingrich bristles at the suggestion that she was just the new model that Gingrich traded in for when it became convenient . ""He's a public figure and people will attack him,"" Marianne says. ""He's just got to take it and keep moving."" In fact, she adds, she and Gingrich spent long hours discussing his troubled previous marriage, which was years in the undoing. ""I've seen bills where they both went to marriage counseling before they split up, before she got ill. The documentation is there."" ""When you're the second wife and you're trying to uphold what you did or who you are, you'll say those things"" is Jackie's only comment. Asked about his divorce by The Atlanta Constitution , Newt Gingrich said, ""Even if I had been sensitive, it would've been a mess."" It is not easy to become the most disliked man in Congress in the space of three terms, but Newt Gingrich was no ordinary congressman. Even before he got to Capitol Hill, when he was making his first run in 1974, he said, ""I intend to go up there and kick the system over, not try to change it."" It was not your usual sort of campaign promise, but then, Gingrich did not keep his word on it. When he arrived in Washington, he ignored the traditional course for freshmen congressmen of quietly taking backseat and doing party and committee grunt work while learning the ropes. Instead, he openly cultivated the press and, of course, he developed his romance with C-SPAN. Nothing was so sweet a piece of happenstance as the arrival of Gingrich and C-SPAN in the House of Representatives at the same moment. They were made for each other. A Washington newsman, Brian Lamb, had had the idea of bringing the proceedings of both houses of Congress to American television viewers as a nonprofit public service. Congressional leaders, accustomed to the clubby seclusion of Congress and frankly skeptical about the television appeal of their work, were doubtful --particularly since Lamb wanted gavel-to-gavel coverage --but House Speaker Tip O'Neill eventually gave the go-ahead. Gingrich, the new face, quickly recognized an opportunity. The House, which limits the length of debate over legislation, has a rule allowing so-called special orders --permission to give lengthy speeches at the end of each legislative day. These have long been a means by which congressman could read into the Congressional Record various matters of importance to their constituents, usually matters of trivia. But Gingrich, concerned less with the Record than with the potential television audience, began to use special orders regularly as his platform for advancing ideas and, especially, for attacking the Democratic majority. At first, his approach gave the impression that he was a brave young crusader, taking on the opposition in heated floor encounters, but, in truth, most of his diatribes were delivered before a virtually empty House. When, in 1984, he escalated his attack on Democrats to the point of questioning their patriotism-- accusing them of being ""blind to Communism"" --Speaker O'Neill lost his cool. In a legendary head-to-head encounter on the floor of the House, the Speaker blasted Gingrich : ""You deliberately stood in that well before an empty House, and challenged these people, and challenged their patriotism, and it is the lowest thing that I've ever seen in my thirty-two years in Congress."" The end of the story, however, was a Gingrich coup: Trent Lott, who was then minority whip, protested O'Neill's attack on Gingrich as being out of order, and O'Neill's remarks were stricken from the record. It was the first such rebuke of a Speaker of the House since 1798. Gingrich was famous. Gingrich gradually developed a political manifesto, a sort of New Age Reaganism, and called his blueprint for a new America the ""Conservative Opportunity Society"" (as opposed, of course, to the Liberal Welfare State.) By 19(86?), although he held no committee chair or leadership position, Newt Gingrich was named by The Almanac of American Politics as one of the twenty-six most influential members of the House. His recognition and his gathering power were not the result of the legislation he drafted or helped to pass, which, in fact, was negligible. And he was scorned by detractors for some of his wackier notions --which ranged from the off-the-wall (plans for statehood in outer space) to potential political dynamite (he once proposed abolishing Social Security and replacing it with mandatory I.R.A.'s). Still, Gingrich's accessibility, and his willingness (and ability) to glibly hold forth on his various notions at a moment's notice, gave him a reputation as a brainiac, a kind of walking lecture, and won him some fans within the more activist branch of the Republican Party. Guy Vander Jagt of Michigan, for one, is as impressed with Gingrich as ever. ""In terms of the sweep of intellect and the energy to drive those intellectual conceptualizations, he has no equal."" For Gingrich, politics is his profession, his sport, and his hobby, and his private life is pretty dull. He and Marianne have never been regulars on the party circuit, they have no children, and they have no pets --because Newt is partial to reptiles. (They bought a boa constrictor at one point, which Newt then donated to the zoo; he wanted to keep it, but Marianne knew they wouldn't be able to find neighbors willing to boa-sit when the Gingriches were out of town.) Marianne says she has only one friend in Washington, and much prefers her life back in Georgia: ""I find Washington an extremely cynical, transitional, unstable place --it's not an easy place."" But Newt thrived in the bright light of the recognition he was receiving, to the point, some would suggest, where his ego became a trifle overfed. Even for a town not populated by self-effacing people, Gingrich has said some pretty memorable things, such as his observation to The Atlantic that his attendance at a National Press Club dinner ""made no sense except that the news media could see me walking through the crowds."" Still high from his success at the '84 convention, when he managed to persuade Reagan's speech writers to include the term ""opportunity society"" in the president's address, he told The Washington Post , ""I have an enormous personal ambition. I want to shift the entire planet. And I'm doing it. Ronald Reagan just used the term ""opportunity society"" and that didn't exist four years ago. I just had breakfast with Darman and Stockman because I'm unavoidable. I represent real power."" He was already a favorite target of the Democrats, and such pronouncements made him even easier prey. ""Newt Gingrich can unify the Democratic Party better than anyone in America,"" says Democratic whip Tony Coelho of his longtime opponent. In 1985, some Democratic staff members assembled a collection of Gingrich's quota, and distributed it under the title Talking Heads-A Newt Gingrich Chrestomathy . In May, a sequel (Son of Talking Heads) was produced, and included this Gingrich gem: ""Vision must lead to words. Our vision cannot exist if we cannot say it. Strategy must lead to policies, to strategies, and they must lead to structures for implementation. Operations must be definable tasks for which we can hold people accountable. The tactics on a daily basis must be a doctrine that fits our vision of strategy."" Gingrich had taken on Democrats almost from the moment he hit town, but in May 1988 he went after the big fish: the Speaker of the House. After spending months preparing his case against Wright, he filed charges of ethics violations with the House Committee on Standards of Official conduct. It was a lonely course; while some Republicans privately cheered Gingrich's move, none would join him in those first months as he fought to bring his complaint. The Speaker of the House --any Speaker-- is a force not to be trifled with, and Wright was held to be particularly vindictive. Also, many Republicans were (and are) unsure about the propriety of making ethics a partisan issue; beyond that, there is the ""glass house"" syndrome in Congress, a work unto itself where ethically questionable behavior is sometimes explicitly within the rules. But Gingrich was determined. It was, politically, the perfect moment to attack Wright; the protracted Ed Meese scandal promised to give Democrats the sleaze issue for their convention, and Gingrich's assault blunted that. So he whaled away at Wright, calling him ""the most corrupt Speaker of the twentieth century,"" and was vindicated, to a degree, when the committee issued its report this April. Essentially, it charged Wright with sixty-nine potential violations. The Speaker, asked at the time about his feelings for Gingrich, said they were like those ""of a fire hydrant for a dog."" The Wright triumph proved to be a clear asset to Gingrich in his campaign for party whip, but, ironically, the position had become vacant only because of a Republican ethics mess --the John Tower affair. When Tower was rejected by the Senate in March, President Bush nominated Dick Cheney of Wyoming, who had just been elected minority whip, for secretary of defense. Gingrich was in his field office in Griffin, Georgia, when he heard the news about Cheney's nomination from a USA Today reporter. He made up his mind instantly. ""It was 3:45 in the afternoon,"" he says. ""I decided by the time I hung up. It was so obvious that, having lost Lott [Trent Lott of Mississippi, who'd been elected to the Senate] and Kemp [who'd moved into Bush's Cabinet] and Cheney, we needed somebody with a good deal of drive and energy to fill the vacuum that those three guys left behind them. And so I decided to try it."" It may have seemed obvious to Gingrich, but not to others. The whip's job (the title does in fact derive from a literal use of the word: the ""whipper-in"" at a fox hunt is a man who keeps the hounds together in a pack) is the ultimate inside party position, involving the counting of noses, the corralling and delivering of votes, the building of coalitions. Gingrich was the quintessential party outsider, a freelancer with no known expertise in vote gathering, several well-known antagonisms within his own party and, of course, with Democrats, and he was no ally of minority leader Bob Michel's. Michel, in fact, was supporting his fellow Illinoisan Edward R. Madigan, who had the traditional qualifications for the role to a T. But Gingrich once again was prepared to seize his moment. He had heard about the Cheney appointment on a Saturday, and immediately got on the telephone, rounding up support for his candidacy. He called Marianne into his office to get food and run errands, while he and his allies worked the phones late into the night. By Monday, he'd built a sizable base of support. Madigan didn't get around to announcing until Monday. Gingrich won the election by two votes, 87 to 85, put over top by some of his longtime moderate adversaries in the party. After Gingrich's victory, Wright sent him a copy of his book Reflections of a Public Man , with the inscription, ""For Newt --who likes books, too...To be chosen by your peers is a great honor."" Gingrich called the Speaker and thanked him --but had second thoughts when it occurred to him that Wright's gesture ""was meant as a publicity stunt."" The vote made clear, Michel said, that the G.O.P. members wanted a more activist leadership. As Gingrich sees it, ""The party went through a twelve-day introspection trying to decide which was the greater risk, and decided on balance it was less risky to have more risks."" Some, including Gingrich himself, believe that his new party ""insider"" status will moderate the former bomb thrower, ""I have to be more cautious now,"" he says, ""because I no longer just speak for myself."" Coelho says that in the early going he has been cooperative, helping to pass the budget through the House without obstruction. But there are also those in the G.O.P. who say that Gingrich is biding his time, that it is one thing to be conciliatory on the budget, and that when it comes to real ""wedge"" issues, those gut issues that can be used against Democrats committed to policies outside the moderate-conservative spectrum, the Gingrich strategy will be to raise hell and publicize the divisions. ""You'll see them more energized, more involved in drawing the line to show the difference between Republican and Democratic behavior,"" Vander Jagt says, ""and therefore you'll see more sharply defined confrontational votes that we can play to. One of my frustrations has been you do not change public perception by issuing press releases from the Republican National Committee. You change it by headlines that result from action under that Capitol dome and votes that are taken there."" But far more important than Gingrich's congressional role is his place in the wider campaign to win the House for the Republican Party. There is in this Republican quest a weird factor at play. Polls cited by both parties show that about half of all Americans don't perceive the House as an institution run by Democrats. When Reagan was in the White House, in fact, more people thought that it was a Republican body. Republican strategists believe, perhaps inevitably, that if voters saw the House as a Democratic monolith, they'd make the same values connection they make in presidential races and take it out on their local Democrats. That's what G.O.P. strategists believe occurred in 1980, when, with Jimmy Carter in the White House, people took for granted that the House was democratic and proceeded to go out and vote for Republican congressional candidates. So Gingrich's role is to drive home the message that the House is a Democratically controlled institution. Or, rather, that it is a ""corrupt, left-wing, Democratically controlled institution."" ""Exactly,"" Vander Jagt says, ""exactly. We don't have Jimmy Carter to help us anymore. Now we've got Newt Gingrich."" Democrats, naturally, consider that underlying premise --that Americans will vote Republican if they realize the House is Democratic-to be, in the words of Representative Anthony, ""poppycock."" Still, they do worry about losing seats when congressional districts are reapportioned before the 1992 election. (As many as twenty seats will shift to the West and South, growing Republican strongholds.) And a Gingrich-led campaign to Willie Horton the Democratic Party figures to hurt individual candidates in the South, where many Democratic congressmen already have to out-conservative the Republicans to win elections. All of this, of course, makes Newt Gingrich a more tempting target for Democrats than ever before, which is why Alexander's ethics complaint against the Georgian should have surprised no one. Democrats considered it the height of hypocrisy for Gingrich to go after Wright for his peculiar book deal when Gingrich himself had made not one but two unusual book arrangements. The first was in 1977, before he actually won his seat, when he accepted $13,000 from his supporters to write a book that he never completed. The second case, involving Gingrich's 1984 manifesto for the Conservative Opportunity Society, concerned a unique arrangement by which twenty-one ""investors"" paid $5,000 each to a limited partnership, run by Mrs. Gingrich, to raise money to promote the book. Gingrich stoutly maintains that his deal is ""fundamentally different"" from Wright's because the money given for his book by each partner was ""an investment, not a gift"" --so defined by Gingrich because each partner had a chance to reap a profit if the book became a best-seller. (It didn't.) However, Gingrich's wife didn't recruit just businessmen in forming the partnership, she recruited supporters of Gingrich's, many of them constituents, and at least fifteen of the people who have contributed to his political campaigns. Some of them have said that they had no intention of making money, they just wanted to do something for Gingrich. Gingrich has taken the assault hard, and was reportedly shaken to the point of tears when he heard that four Democratic colleagues were asking that a special outside counsel pursue the charges. He says he was ""surprised and hurt,"" and spent long, anguished hours wondering if he had in fact done something worthy of investigation. But Newt Gingrich didn't get this far by indulging in self-doubt. The next day the bomb thrower was back on the attack, accusing the Democrats of ""an amateur smear,"" and bullying the press for refusing to blithely accept his definition of an ""investment"" (House rules prohibit gifts from individuals in excess of $1,000). He played the annoyed college instructor, hectoring and ridiculing reporters. When he told Andrea Mitchell of NBC News that she was ""overreaching"" with a question, she expressed the sentiment of many in the room by snapping back, ""It's an environment you helped to create."" It's an environment that figures to get muddier. Newt Gingrich has touched off a scandal of truly historic proportion. The various investigations of Wright's personal and business conduct range far beyond Gingrich's original charges, and the ethics committee is now probing allegations of wrongdoing related to Wright's unusual good fortune in an oil well deal (his blind trust turned a nifty $292,000 profit in a month). As the revelations continue, congressional and media scrutiny of the Speaker has intensified. The Washington Post published a devastating retelling of a brutal stabbing by the man who was Wright's top aide on Capitol Hill. Though the story had been common knowledge in congressional circles, the article was the talk of Washington for several days and resulted in the aide's resignation. It gave vivid, spine-chilling details of John Paul Mack's 1973 assault on a twenty-year old customer of the Virginia store in which he was then working as a clerk. He went berserk, slashing the woman and crushing her skull with a hammer, then left her for dead. After two years in jail, Mack was released on a work program; he had been promised a job in the office of Congressman Jim Wright --whose daughter was then married to Mack's brother. The sordid allegations and news stories multiply, and it has become clear to members on both sides of the aisle that Wright is unlikely to survive as Speaker of the House. At best, he'll be allowed to resign his post and retain some shred of dignity. Furthermore, one of the likely choices to succeed him, Tony Coelho, may himself be facing an ethics-committee inquiry for failing to make required disclosures about his highly profitable purchase of a Drexel junk bond. The bottom line is that Gingrich has delivered a crushing blow to the Democratic Party, and he's prepared to escalate the battle if necessary. ""There are at least nine cases of documented Democratic scandals that by their standard would require independent counsel,"" he notes, then goes on to make what sounds very much like a threat. For the Democrats to press the case against him, Newt Gingrich warns, would be ""an act of self-immolation that is irrational."" Both Republicans and Democrats agree that this highly partisan ethics war has already inflicted heavy damage. But in the brave new political world personified by Newt Gingrich, a world in which confrontation is an end as well as a means, the bloodletting almost certainly won't stop here. more about newt . interviews . his work and writings . his reading list . a chronology",0

In 1995, Time magazine named him ""Man of the Year"" for his role in ending 40 years of majority rule by the Democratic Party. During his four years as House speaker, Gingrich sometimes opposed President Bill Clinton, but he also worked closely with Clinton in 1996 to limit public welfare; in 1997 to pass a capital gains tax cut; and in 1998 to pass the first balanced budget since 1969.

I’m sure it must sound the same to American audiences when some British actors do American accents but I personally haven’t seen many American actors pull of a convincing one. Most British people don’t speak in a super posh manner as it is portrayed in American media. Some British people speak that way, but that’s in smaller pockets. So a lot of the portrayal is over the top but Alan Tudyk is one I’ve seen where it’s pretty good. His voice in Rogue one of K2 SO where he played an English sounding droid.

Gaga is a healthy young woman in her late 20s, and that usually means attractive.  Her weight fluctuates, usually gaining while she's on tour, and dropping weight when preparing for a new tour as she exercises and prepares new dance routines.  When her body is toned, I personally find her quite attractive.  As she puts on more weight, less so.

1443603714464387075,Britney Spears is a gay icon and she’s not gay. Easy.,"Now, what else goes to attractiveness?  Beauty gets the door open, and gets a second look, but after all, it is only skin deep.  And this is where her personality comes into play.  Her talent speaks for itself; she writes her own material, sings extraordinarily well (with or without auto-tune), dances well, and can hold her own as a professional keyboardist.  Her sense of fashion has generated endless criticism, but seen in proper perspective, what you are seeing is backlash to a love of the avant garde.  That's her style, extremely forward-looking, haute couture taken to the nth degree.  You either love it or you hate it, if you hate it, you probably wouldn't enjoy being around her as she works on her fashion projects.",0
1443603714464387075,Britney Spears is a gay icon and she’s not gay. Easy.,"But the measure of personality with regards to attractiveness is how that personality is expressed in private moments.

1443589127971115011,Chris Christie is a fat butthurt baby. Total image genius.,"Nowhere is this more evident that with the entirety of the slow chase between the First Order and the Resistance, which requires an enormous amount of incompetence from both factions, convenience or lack thereof to keep the chase going, and a bewildering lack of creativity in solving the issue. The First Order has the resources to launch hundreds, if not thousands of TIE fighters to destroy a fleet of three ships (in-universe, a standard Star Destroyer can carry up to twelve squadrons of fighters, around 144 total), yet chooses not to because those fighters would be out of range from their own destroyers and thus couldn’t be covered (despite a measly three fighters being enough to lay waste to a Resistance hangar and destroy a command bridge easily); apparently it’s too much to risk a few dozen TIE fighters out of hundreds to wipe out the Resistance, even though the Resistance at that point couldn’t launch any starfighters against them (remember, the hangar was attacked and its fighters were wiped out). The First Order also makes the questionable choice of using only one tracker at a time despite having that same technology on multiple ships, instead of using them all and coordinating information.",0

There are countless ideas of getting out of the situation which including contacting Rey or using the transport that Finn and Rose use to evacuate people little-by-little, yet Holdo’s idea boils down to “run and hope they don’t scan for us when we pass by the only planet in the area.”

Within its own lore, starships of that size are capable of operating in systems for months at a time without resupply, even while factoring in jumps to lightspeed.

Obi-Wan observed and protected Luke from afar and knew that putting himself back in the fight would only draw attention to both the Rebels and Luke; while Yoda knew that just his power alone would be noticeable to the Emperor, forcing him to choose a planet teeming with life and the Force to conceal him while waiting to train a student. In both cases they were living in an era where they would have been killed on sight, but for Luke’s case, the First Order hadn’t risen to power yet and he was in no true danger as long as they were operating from the shadows; the only writing decision left, apparently, was to paint Luke as a coward and traitor who abandoned his friends and family. Many people have agreed that this is not what Luke Skywalker would do, and that the explanation given does not merit his actions in the film.
4. Rose Tico is a completely useless character and her presence leads to the most boring, awkward, or completely idiotic moments in the film. The parts she becomes involved in revolve around ham-fisted messages about war as a trade and corrupt element of the universe, and her lamenting about the abuse of animals. Neither of these arguments are executed with an ounce of subtlety and the release of the abused animals is embarrassingly childlike and naïve (there’s literally nothing stopping their captors from recapturing the animals and then punishing the child labor that Rose completely ignored); even the scumbag DJ character shows more nuanced philosophy and realism that she does. She reinforces the fact that the movie’s characters continue to make ridiculous decisions by preventing Finn’s sacrifice, and her excuse revolves around the idea that she’s fallen in love with him despite the fact that the majority of the movie has been spent with her criticizing him for his supposed cowardice, with absolutely no moment spent establishing any sort of romantic connection.
5. The villains are turned into complete jokes, morphing from menacing and conniving foes to mouth-frothing, high-volume, always-shouting incompetent officers. Their imbecilic military decisions aside, the actions and fates of the villains are diminished to the point that they come off as barely threatening; which only serves to make the heroes look worse when they are almost completely destroyed by the end of the film. While they had the potential to be interesting and menacing figures when first introduced, The Last Jedi took the potential away and wasted it for the sake of “subversion.” Imperial officers and commanders in the OT performed their duties with cold efficiency; but First Order officers and commanders spend most of their time screaming or snarling orders, with a barely-concealed violent attitude loaded with angry emotions.",0

The dynamic between him and Kylo Ren started off as a rivalry with different approaches and actions, with Hux as the cool and calculated evil while Ren is emotional and short-tempered - TLJ turned him into a punching bag for slapstick, and starts him off with being the butt of a crank call by Poe. This, mixed with the continued incompetence of the First Order as a whole, has the net effect of sapping away the fear factor of the organization.",0

Most villains get at least some exposition as to their origins, or at least a buildup to their ultimate introduction. Snoke gets neither, and he’s killed off in short order without any discussion of his methods, goals, motivations, or history- he is rendered completely pointless except as a springboard for Kylo Ren to take his place, which could have been completely circumvented narratively if they’d simply put him in charge from the start. Even Palpatine got more definition in A New Hope when Grand Moff Tarkin and Vader are discussing his dissolution of the Imperial Senate and methods of controlling through fear. But someone like Snoke, who is shown to be extremely powerful and a master to Kylo Ren (who has shown impressive power on his own), should have gotten at least some explanation.",0
1443589127971115011,Chris Christie is a fat butthurt baby. Total image genius.,"Perhaps the biggest victim of this, however, is Captain Phasma, and it is disheartening to see Gwendoline Christie being given such a short and meaningless role despite her strong acting ability and overemphasized advertising; even in interviews, she discusses the character as having a larger role than she actually had. Between both TFA and TLJ, she has had a grand total of three minutes and thirty seconds of screen time. The idea that her character couldn’t be developed any further due to the movie’s substantial length (they even filmed good scenes between her and Finn that didn’t make it into the final cut) is nonsense, there was plenty of useless fat to be cut from the main film to give some sort of defining character moment to her and Finn.
6. Rey propels herself deeper into Mary-Suedom. Defenders of the film continue to argue that this isn’t the case and that she undergoes character arcs and growth because she is in a different place by the end of the films; this is nonsense. Rey is essentially the same character at the end of The Last Jedi that she started out as in The Force Awakens. The common counter-argument will point out her abundance of new Force abilities by this point, as if the compiling of such powerful skills in such short order (measured by days, and not weeks) without any actual training somehow diminishes the idea that she is a poorly-written power fantasy character; but when I refer to character, I’m talking about her character qualities and her growth, and in that sense she is essentially the same character. She retains her idealism, her morality, undergoes no transformation (as her abilities are scaled high even from the get-go and she succeeds in nearly everything on the first try), and her positioning in the story only occurs because it’s what the story wants her to do, rather than an organic growth and flow of the character and the story.",0
1443589127971115011,Chris Christie is a fat butthurt baby. Total image genius.,"As an example: Nothing is known about Rey by Leia at the point she meets her. The two share a hug (which most people agree should have been between Leia and Chewbacca), but by that point, Leia doesn’t know the girl other than she’s a prisoner that Finn wanted to rescue. Despite that, and with no scene to actually articulate the reasoning, Leia decides to send Rey more or less alone to track down Luke and bring him back (I say alone, because Luke and Chewbacca don’t even interact longer than ten seconds in The Last Jedi). Think about that - Leia sent a person she knows nothing about (her allegiances/loyalties, her skills and abilities, her personal motivations, or her stake in the conflict) to find her brother, the single most important person in the universe as far as she’s concerned. There is no reason for this except that it was what the filmmakers wanted to happen.",0
1443589127971115011,Chris Christie is a fat butthurt baby. Total image genius.,"The most crucial element she’s missing, ironically, is actual failure. The movie makes it a point to add a message about the importance of failure being necessary for growth and learning, which I would normally get behind - the problem is that failure is meaningless if you don’t learn anything from it. Rey learns nothing from her failures, and does not suffer any permanent or long-lasting repercussions for her failures. That is a huge mistake in her narrative, especially given the amount of power she wields. In most responsible narratives, the accumulation of a great source of power is often written side-by-side with the failure to respect that power and the consequences of underestimating a foe or an element of the power they wield; that, in turn, leads to the character learning respect for that power and realizing the tremendous responsibility they’re carrying, and the amount of wisdom they’ll need in order to apply it appropriately - and the consequences of abusing that power. These were all things Luke learned in The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi; the realization that he wasn’t ready to face his father or to be burdened with the truth and significance of his own lineage, the potential consequences of falling too deeply, and the people he loves being at stake for his failures. Hints of it are even seen when Luke confronts his own inner darkness, his failure at the dark side tree telling him he stands to become Vader if he can’t conquer his impulses.",0

What has she learned? Because the answer to all of that is nothing. We don’t get to see her inner darkness, and we’re never afraid of what she’ll become if she fails, because the movie does not want her to fail (or at least, it does not want her to fail in a way that is lasting). The burden of being a Jedi, which is often described as a hard life, isn’t treated as a position of reverence or responsibility, less so since she hasn’t even undergone sufficient training or even been taught the basics of Jedi philosophy (Luke certainly didn’t teach her). Even the ending makes it seem like she has succeeded as a hero, despite the fact that the Resistance has been reduced from 400 people on three ships to only a dozen tops on a single Corellian freighter; all of whom seem to be celebrating, chatting, and smiling when they should be mourning or acting shell-shocked. Except for Rose, who is unconscious.
7. Nothing mattered in the end. The conclusion of Return of the Jedi is rendered meaningless. The entire sequel trilogy, not just The Last Jedi, retroactively diminishes everything Luke and the Rebel Alliance fought for, everything they ever did, by making it meaningless.",0

Defeating the Empire doesn't matter, because the First Order rose from it and became the reigning faction in the universe by the end of the first movie; defeating the Emperor doesn't matter, because he comes back as the antagonist behind the scenes, to serve as a Mary Sue antagonist; Luke being told to pass on everything he's learned doesn't matter, because his Jedi Order gets wiped out off-screen; the destruction of two Death Stars doesn't matter, because the First Order builds a third one out of an entire planet (and weapons based on miniaturized Death Star tech); the formation of the New Republic doesn't matter, because it gets destroyed in the first film of the sequels; and Luke redeeming his fallen father using compassion and Jedi training doesn't matter, because he doesn't give his nephew the same treatment, even considering killing him when he hadn't even done anything.",0

They took everything that made him such an admired and compelling character, and handed it to Rey without her having to struggle for it or earn it - his abilities, his sense of justice, his wisdom, his character arc in redeeming a fallen Jedi; and now with The Rise of Skywalker, his main antagonist, the Emperor. By the end of the third movie, Rey has taken everything from him, including his X-wing, his pilot’s helmet, his aunt and uncle’s moisture farm, and even his last name. The Last Jedi essentially reduces the efforts and sacrifices of the heroes from the original movies by resurrecting the old conflict with the same story beats, arcs, and character roles and giving everything Star Wars was to the new movies without them having to earn it, and without having to expend effort creating anything original.",0

You probably don’t realize she had a grade 4 brain bleed when she was born at 26 weeks gestation. Most strangers don’t notice the mild cerebral palsy she has as a result. However, she has extremely tight muscles and even though she walks and runs and seems typical to most people who don’t know her well, she tires very easily making walking long distances extremely difficult. She falls frequently and becomes quite frustrated, so out comes the stroller. It makes life a little easier for her. The real answer to your question is complex because there are a multitude of reasons an older child might be in a stroller: sensory processing disorders, physical disabilities that are not obvious, severe asthma, some medications, behavior disorders, safety issues in large crowds.

It is asinine to think that a stranger, or even an extended family member, would know better what a specific child needs than his or her parents. A short list of possibly reasons might include a child that is getting over an illness, has diabetes, low muscle tone or strength, anxiety about crowds or getting lost, autism, developmental delays, gets tired, needs naps, a wanderer, a long vacation, poor night's sleep, physical disability, and any number of other things for which a parent would decide to use a stroller.",0

And no amount of churching can wipe away the creepy nature of Justin most likely having had sex with at least two of the Kris Jenner’s kids (Kourtney Kardashian and Kendall Jenner). He also, at the very least, definitely had a steamy photo shoot with Kim Kardashian (when Justin was 16 and Kim was a lot older than 18). Why are these Kardashian Konnections important?

He was probably 16-17 at least,"Justin has an even longer history with the Kardashians, going all the way back to before his 2010 photo shoot with Kimberly. The Bieber-KarJenner connection does start with Kim, though, because they met at that year’s White House Correspondents Dinner. There, Justin joked that Kim was his “girlfriend,” and Kim replied that she had “Bieber Fever.” Yes, she was a grown woman, and he was a child, but age ain’t nothing but a number in Woodland Hills. I assume Kim found Justin a more suitable friend for her actual teenage sisters at the time, and that’s how Justin got looped into the family’s life, and by extension, Selena. By 2014, Justin and Selena had been dating for about four years, which is how she met the Jenner sisters. But again, that friendship fell off quickly, due to the flirting drama between Justin and Kylie. This drama is also why the tannest photo of 2018, Selena and Kylie at this year’s Met Gala, was so major, as the two ladies hadn’t been seen together in years.",0

All roads lead back to Calabasas, which is why we should be just about as concerned about our nation’s future majority coming from the seeds of Kris Jenner, or those adjacent to her, as we should be about fracking.

1443585627673354258,Justin bieber is a racist pig idc how long ago this video was! He was probably 16-17 at least,"But let me get back to the history we’re living now. Much like Christian Kris (who owns her own Calabasas church that has both tax issues and a glaring Kardashian absence — none of her famous family are members), Justin and Hailey enjoy themselves some good old-fashioned Jesus Christ. Think of them as those super-hot kids in high school who probably had sex under the football bleachers, but prayed afterward. This is how Christian they are: Combined, they share about 81 tattoos (Hailey has 19 and Justin well over 60), many, many of which allude to God in some way. Justin has the requisite crosses, “SON OF GOD,” and prayer hands inked on his person, and under the guidance of Kendall Jenner Hailey has the words “PRAY” on her hands. And not in a boring way either, a cool way: “PR” is on her left hand and “AY” is on her right, so when she gets down on her knees for prayer each night and clasps her newly engaged hands to pray, the word “PRAY” is formed. An even bigger blessing for the couple is that many of their tattoos were tattooed by the same man, JonBoy. I think we just found their officiant!",0

He was probably 16-17 at least,"Unlike myself, who gets her church fix via podcasts while on the subway, Justin and Hailey hit the church IRL on the regular. And not just any church, the church in Hollywood — Hillsong. Members include Chris Pratt, the Kardashians, Selena Gomez, Bono, and just about anyone else too scared of Leah Remini to join Scientology – it’s that celebrity driven. It’s also driven by a man, and Justin’s BFF, Carl Lentz, who has no qualms about perpetuating Hillsong’s deeply homophobic platform. According to Carl, he doesn’t hate gay people, he just “does not affirm all lifestyles,” and “because of this [Hillsong does not] knowingly have actively gay people in positions of leadership, either paid or unpaid.” Justin’s mentor also disagrees with a woman’s right to choose whether or not she should get an abortion. Still, Hailey and Justin frequent HellHillsong regularly. Their first time together was with Kendall Jenner. Hillsong’s very conservative views aren’t that surprising, given the fact that Hailey’s father, Stephen Baldwin, is a pretty active Trump supporter.",0

He was probably 16-17 at least,"One thing I can tell you for sure that Hillsong isn’t teaching the young couple is manners, or the importance of words. Both Hailey and Justin have suffered through bouts of mental instability that resulted in them both using the N-word on separate occasions. For Justin, his mental lapse happened while he was 14 and singing a parody of his song “One Less Lonely Girl” and replacing “girl” with the N-word. He also joked about killing black people and joining the KKK, all of which got giggles from whomever was behind the camera. In 2016, Justin again hurtled the word at a man during a Cleveland fight. For Hailey, it happened just a couple of years ago when she was 19 and a part of a group chat on Instagram. If you’re wondering, yes, the chat included black people and Kardashian Konnections: Kylie’s best friend, the somehow still getting famous Jordyn Woods, and Calabasas fan favorite Shaun Maurice.

Last year, she released the song 'Senorita', and I was extremely surprised when it became such a huge hit. Yes, the tune is catchy, but the lyrics and singing are entirely rubbish. Honestly, I think that Cabello is literally 'puking' in the song, and is putting a lot of pressure in singing it. It seems like she doesn't even know how to sing. Furthermore, it seems that she and Shawn Mendes (the person who co-sang the song with her) didn't know what to write and didn't have anything to write, and just so that the song is complete, added the rubbish 'ooh-la-la-la' and 'true-la-la-la'.

I gave a few listens to her works, and it was literally some of the worst singing ever recorded, making William Hung sound like Stevie Wonder in the process (at least William Hung attempts to hit the notes in pitch but failed). Poor tone is one thing (and tone is mostly subjective to me), but she also has nearly no sense of pitch and musicality in her singing. 
 
Take a look at this live performance of Don't Worry Kyoko, for example, where all she does is nothing but sounding like a screaming banshee throughout:

 * He once took his mom to the MTV awards as his date. Accepted the award with his mother and thanked her as she was the sole reason to his fame. They both have probably gone together to many awards.
 * She was the one who uploaded his videos on YouTube when he was 6 years old.
 * Justin was quite popular in the YouTube community then also, before his manager Scooter Braun signed him(when he was 13 years old).
 * Also when Scooter singed him and fly him to Atlanta and Usher was there and Justin asked Usher if he could hear him sing and he sang his heart out even though Scooter said to not say a word when they were with Usher :P
 * Usher was so impressed with his singing that he wanted to officially mentor him. In the end Justin was given a choice to choose between Usher and Justin Timberlake to choose as his mentor. He chose Usher :)
 * He was poor and lived with his maternal grandparents home with his mother when his dad left when he was little(don’t know the exact time)
 * He was bullied for wearing clothes that were too large for him. (probably of his parents and grandparents)
 * He used to perform outside an arena and he was so good that he collected 200$ in one day that he used to buy a drum set(and you guessed it he is really good in drumming too)
 * He still has his YouTube Channel (after from his official JustinBieberVevo) which her mother uploaded and regularly uploads his songs there too called “Kidrauhl”. Only his OG fans know about this :)
 * And if you swipe down his channel, you can see him singing in front of Usher for the first time and the time when he played his drums and everything. The making of an artist :)
Ending it now, I would just like to address that yes he have done many stupid and straight-up wrong things but remember how much pressure is on him. He never really lived his life as a normal human being and that doesn’t justify what he did but its really important to put things in perspective rather than judging people.",0

So a lot of the black women do not feel compelled to get married. And then the other issue is the availability of black men and whether they’re eligible to be married. You have so many black men incarcerated, so many black men unemployed, underemployed. In colleges now, black women outnumber black men two to one.

It can stop them from living in better conditions. It can stop improvements from being made. For instance, if you have a slum landlord, if you’re lower, lower economic, to get that fixed, to bring the law in on this person, it, it just doesn’t happen.

Sure, the newspapers wrote about it, but it happened. Juries were set and freed the, people who did the, the lynching. Therefore, we knew how to fight, we knew how to protect our children, protect our women. Today, in lower, lower economic areas, some people—not all—some people are not contributing to that protection.

You’re going to do it this way.” It’s going—and the, and the, the person who’s made the transformation says, “And he or she stayed on me.” I mean, it’s just, just, if you, if, if I may. There’s a white girl in Birmingham, and she pointed to this white woman, and she said, “When I came to her, schools had rendered me in terms of, of, of just not being able to do anything.

POUSSAINT: That you—well, no, it’s—the community’s not monolithic. At the same time, there are things that affect all of us as black people. If you have a Jena-type incident, even if you weren’t the person—the kids who were, who were given those harsh sentences, you still feel that as a, as, as a black person. If there’s a lynching of some type, you feel that as a black person, whether you are upper middle class or whether you are lower income. Of course, lower income people catch more of it. They’re going to be much more likely to be victims of racial profiling, discrimination in the criminal justice system. But also, Bill and I could feel some stress and tension around racial profiling because it may happen to us, or it does happen to us, too. So I think we’re all hooked in, in one way. I think what separates us is, is kind of a socioeconomic divide, that you have many poor black people now suffering a lot of the things we talk about in this book. If—you know, if you’re a high school dropout, you’re likely to be poor and you’re likely to go to, go to jail. That’s not as true for black middle class people. And in many, many urban areas, you have huge clusters of the very, very poor without kind of balanced communities over class lines, so that there is a separation and sometimes a feeling that the two groups are not communicating with each other.",0

POUSSAINT: Well, I—well, I think there’s always personal responsibility, no matter what’s going on in society. There was personal responsibility, you know, during Jim Crow segregation. And a lot of black people, their history is succeeding against the odds. People always make—have choices to make. If they’re poor, if they’re not poor, things that you can do or not do. Are you going to take drugs, or you’re not going to take drugs? Are you going to go to school, are you going to try to learn, or you’re not going to try to learn? A lot of these are, are choices that people make, that children make, that young people make, but also that families make. Do you want to support education in your home, or you want to ignore it, in fact, do the opposite? Right? You, you tell parents support education, and read to their, read to their children, is a big way of supporting their education, even when they’re not yet one year, year of age, you know, when they’re four months old. And a lot of parents are reluctant to do the simple kinds of things. We have a HIV-AIDS epidemic in the black community where we’re responsible for 50 percent of the new cases. Well, there’s behavior, see, connected to all of these things. Do we have choices around what kind of food we eat? We have an obesity, diabetes epidemic in the black community. To suggest that all of those problems are due totally and solely to systemic racism, I, I think, is just not correct. But I think systemic racism should be worked on always.

You show this by offering to listen and give your time in response to his/her gesture of giving you the letter. Another message you send is that you are willing to put them in a relaxing atmosphere of a restaurant at no cost to the former employee. This is not an exit interview, this is a listening session. By not opening the letter, you basically are telling the person you respect what they really might have said in person. In emotionally charged situations like a termination, the former employee likely wrote some things he/she regrets or would have worded differently. Another important point is that your former employee is most likely an introverted personality. An extrovert would have told you what needed to be said in the moment. The introvert ponders things in his/her mind before communicating. That is why a private meeting in a public place is ideal. You also give the former employee the possibility of retaining those words in the letter, this may be the motivation which makes them decide to meet with you.",0

Thank him/her for coming, and for allowing you the opportunity to listen. Then hand them the letter and tell them, “sometimes we say things differently when under difficult circumstances. That goes for both of us. I want to hear what you want to say.” You then embark on a decent conversation as two human beings should. You don’t interrupt. You ask thoughtful, and short questions for clarification. But you let them decide what they want to talk about. It may turn out that you wrongfully terminated your employee. If it turns out that you did in fact terminate properly, this is your opportunity to minimize any fallout. You simply acknowledge that there are compatibility issues with the individual and the company. However, you praise their qualities as a person.

For hundreds of years in America’s history, if a black man was accused of rape he could expect death and an unfair trial, if any trial at all, whereas white men were permitted to rape enslaved women. But it’s always been hard to prosecute a powerful person of anything, especially rape and sexual assault. Cosby’s victims were initially regarded as attention hungry liars until Hannibal Burress brought the accusations into public light. Some people looked to Cosby as a respected figure from his career in the 80s where he played a doctor in a seemingly perfect family.

The only unique element of the show was the Tim Allen Noises, of which there are two: an “uhh” sound, given an unnatural amount of what we now call uptalk, and a slowed-down version of the “OH WAH AH AH AH” noise from Disturbed’s “Down With the Sickness.” These noises, along with Marcy Playground, dial-up modems, and the hum of CRT monitors, helped to make that entire decade an aural hell.",0

1443299485535330309,Bill Cosby is a lowlife POS rapist who should be rotting in prison.  F*ck him and his attorneys.,"The premise of Last Man Standing is that Allen, as Michael “Mike” Baxter, is consistently baffled by the female presences of wife, Nancy, a professional fracker, and three daughters, Kristin, Mandy, and Eve. The gender politics of the show are somewhat confusing. Instead of the Baxter home being the realm of the feminine, insulated from the brutal world of male competition, Allen’s character creates a hostile environment by demanding an inversion of established gender norms. By his rule, men and women are forced to adopt unconditional masculinity as an ethos. Mike Baxter is also a racist, and instead of hosting a show about carpentry like Tim “the Toolman” Taylor, he works as a marketing executive for a sporting goods chain (TV writers love to do this: By placing your sitcom dad in a superficially blue-collar job with a white-collar salary, you can give him everyman appeal without having to acknowledge the financial struggles of blue-collar work). This new variation of Allen’s act is motivated primarily by cultural conservatism and jealousy of his daughters’ boyfriends. Much like those creepy “rules for dating my daughter” T-shirts that celebrate treating women like property, Allen’s need to impress his daughters by one-upping teen boys (in the pilot, he suggests that his daughter leave her boyfriend because, unlike her father, he can’t change a tire) is less “ha-ha” funny than “indicative of deep-seated sexual pathology” funny.",0

The cultural imprint of Home Improvement was far too slight to merit present-day nostalgia, even in a culture that exists primarily to recycle itself (see: vaporwave, an internet-spawned “microgenre” that collects pieces of cornball innocence from the ’80s and ’90s and mashes them into digital pop art). Cultural detritus like this, despite its insistence on multiple levels of self-aware irony, is one of the purest and most sincere expressions of generational dread, of the feeling that Baby Boomers promised us a bright future and then worked behind the scenes to ruin it. Income inequality, student loans, climate change, never being able to own property, yadda yadda yadda; the anxious millennial mind looks backward at the optimism of childhood. Windows ’95 ads that got people excited about the future of home computers — a future that turned out to be Windows 8 begging you to install Windows 10 for free. Seinfeld, in which Generation Xers somehow managed to live in Manhattan and go out to eat every day despite working sporadically at best. Home Improvement wasn’t an optimistic portrayal of a nuclear family; it was a bleak one. It was a white upper-middle-class dad in ill-fitting jeans, a man who was somehow both anti-intellectual and a know-it-all, an incompetent handyman who routinely started fires and fell off the roof but was nonetheless crowned an expert and given a TV show. None of this was novel then, and it isn’t novel now.",0

Shortly after we lost Home Improvement, we elected George W. Bush who, like Allen, adopted an “everyman” character and reinforced it with his constant pratfalls. Like Allen, he was arrested for a DUI and treated with the utmost leniency. (The incident report from Allen’s 1997 arrest: “Mr. Dick was asked to recite the alphabet. Mr. Dick attempted the alphabet, but when he reached the letter ‘O’ he then stated ‘Q, R, Z.’” He received one year probation.) American audiences, despite our devotion to strict meritocracy, love the trope in which a bumbling idiot is nonetheless handed fame and fortune through inheritance or dumb luck. It comes as no surprise that Last Man Standing went on air shortly after Bush left office, and it will come as no surprise if its series finale airs shortly after Trump, a gaffe-prone TV star who lusts after his daughter, stumbles into the White House.

As the relative influence of network sitcoms grows ever smaller, so does the media footprint of the two-bit comic they were so often built to showcase. The sitcom patriarchs of the 1990s are now relegated to the status of professional grumps — Bill Cosby, up until dozens of sexual assault allegations ended his career, delighted right-wing commentators by lambasting black teenagers for wearing saggy pants. Jerry Seinfeld caused a stir last year when he criticized PC outrage on college campuses (“They just want to use these words: ‘That’s racist’; ‘That’s sexist’; ‘That’s prejudiced.’ They don’t know what they’re talking about,” he said) and advised comedians not to do college gigs.",0

His daughter is actually a hamfisted caricature of the overzealous campus activists hyped by Jonathan Chait and Reason magazine.

Reinforcing the norms of the “stereotypical American male” by repeating them ad nauseum was a good start, but, as with any effort to take pride in one’s status as a member of a dominant group, this was merely a surrogate for supremacist anger. An undercurrent of rage at the Other, at the feminine or the tolerant or the intellectual, is what drives Allen’s comedy. In an interview earlier this year he was asked how he differs from the right-winger he plays in Last Man Standing. His response: “He's milder than I am. You wouldn't want to hear what I have to say.” Given that his character’s rants are a mainstay at Breitbart, the self-professed “home of the alt-right,” what must he be saying in private to make them look comparatively mild? When Seinfeld’s Michael Richards squandered his canceled-sitcom goodwill in 2006 by screaming the n-word at a black heckler, he was acting prematurely. He should have started small and worked his way up to that grand finale. Tim Allen was smart enough to play the long game.",0

The Black community had only the likes of The Jeffersons, and Red Fox’s Sanford and Son.

1443299485535330309,Bill Cosby is a lowlife POS rapist who should be rotting in prison.  F*ck him and his attorneys.,"1. Standard of evidence — I have a problem with the standard of evidence; but I have no say. The standard of evidence is something negotiated among the US courts and the parties.
2. Me Too — in both the Cosby and Weinstein cases, at least a few of the women who claim they are charging ahead with Me Too are doing so to support women and the rights of those who have been sexually victimized, as well as justice for sexual assault victims. As commendable as those goals may be, at some point in the past, at least a few of the accusers used their sexual encounters and the connections resulting therefrom to further their entertainment careers, rather than report the alleged sex crimes or to publicize them to warn female colleagues 10-50 years ago. Sure, going public about such a violent crime was a risk to their careers. And the older their stories, the more their stories feel like convenient timing because they would have, at the very least, alerted every other vulnerable female at the time of the occurrence to prevent at least a few of the subsequent alleged assaults. Understanding that this requires an assumption that one or some of the accusers chose their careers over warning other potential victims, there is no need to press this statement. This statement speaks for itself, loud and clear. This is not my own first- or highest-priority concern, but it is a concern about the consciences of late-coming accusers to bear in mind when they reconcile their career paths and their success in the entertainment industry, with the sheer number of other alleged victims, some of whom are decades younger than themselves.
3. Internal conflict. My third concern relates to the concern above, and the above deconstruction, which I provided to highlight what seem to fall just shy of mutually negating conflicts, based on a generalization: (a) believing accusers who meet the evidentiary standard and (b) giving every accuser the benefit of the doubt but for their time- and quaalude-fogged claims, made on nationally televised morning talk shows, on podcasts, and in social media. I'm not sure how to view this conflict, having witnessed two rapes about which I could do nothing without endangering my own life and the lives of the victims.
 * 
 * Rape is not taken as seriously as a mugging in this country — at least it wasn't in the 1980s, when the two rapes I had witnessed occurred, but had they occurred today, there was some likelihood the rapes would have been investigated and usually prosecuted.
 * 
 * In one case, the victim was so high that she doesn't remember it, so her view is out of mind, out of sight.
 * In the other, the victim refused to let me take her to the police. She said it was her fault for being where she was, though it was not her fault; she and I both would have endangered our lives had either of us done anything differently.
 * Neither of these women would think of stepping forward 35–40 years later in good conscience to suddenly accuse their rapists of rape, exactly because they did not do it when it occurred. They accepted the rules of the culture.
 * One of the victims carries a lot of guilt for remaining silent, but in her words, “damage done. God knows who else they've raped, but he would have killed me anyway.”",0

Really? Why do we have to believe that someone who was not willing to sacrifice the career to alert potential victims? Is it because they accepted the rules of the culture? My statements about needing to see the evidence before taking any position garners me anything from the stink-eye to implied betrayal of ‘my kind’ to outright hostility. Nope, sorry, “belief” is one hell of a dangerous broad-jump past listening to every victim, and seriously and critically considering all allegations, evidence and testimony, before drawing a conclusion (a conclusion that is meaningless in a court of law, and should not have any meaning in society).",0

I am frankly suspicious that these kinds of movements are less about seeking long overdue justice or psychological support for those who need it and more about team sportsmanship and vigilantism.

A whiner (his show was cancelled because he was too conservative, according to him. Waaaahhh!), a drunk, and not even a funny comedian. Seems like a full service jerk.
2. Angelina Jolie - All over the map and not in a “good way”. Puts her personal life on display and then complains when she’s questioned about the inconsistencies. Went on a “child buying tour” around the world , yet seemingly treats them like accessories. Made a number of unfounded accusations about her ex-husband Brad Pitt and has not retracted even though the majority were proven to be false or overstatements.
3. Mariah Carey - Tremendously insecure. Acts like a diva which would be good if this was 1995, but it’s actually 25 years later. Apparently goes out of her way to make people who work for her and around her feel uncomfortable at all times.
4. Gwyneth Paltrow - Completely detached from reality beyond her own wants and needs. Is making a great deal of money selling junk and nick-knacks to the foolish and unwary. Is possibly the phoniest person in Hollywood which itself is quite an accomplishment.
5. Jenny McCarthy - Presses an anti-vaxxer agenda, all the while knowing that she’s influencing people and causing harm. Unwilling to modify or end her cause célèbre even after medical professionals have come out against it. Basically a person without a moral center.",0

But he certainly has shown himself to be a complete clod as a seducer. Maybe that is because as a powerful man he feels entitled to touch or kiss anyone he fancies without any consideration of whether or not these attentions are welcome. Trump famously said on film that “when you’re a star, they let you do it”. Well, some do, but not all. I think that because Cuomo was not liked, he finally getting a comeuppance.

to get someone to listen to her and to try and get him charged. Every one she told
about her rape and being drugged by Cosby, would not believe her! She even spoke to a lawyer that she said “laughed her out of his office.” Finally after several years someone acted on what she told them. Of course there was also that
comedian that did a show on stage, I don’t even remember where. He got talking
about Bill Cosby and making fun of the fact that he had been accused of raping
women. There was a reporter from a newspaper sitting in the audience at one of his shows and she decided to look into the story. From there the SHTF.",0

1443235381546295299,@TMZ Bill Cosby is a sex offender who got off on a technicality.  Who cares what he thinks?,Why?,0
1443235381546295299,@TMZ Bill Cosby is a sex offender who got off on a technicality.  Who cares what he thinks?,"1. He’s worth $500 million - Not drug money; REAL MONEY. That means that he could conceivably bankroll a series of appeals that could set legal precedents in the United States. He can employ the titans of the criminal defense world; and he could do so for a relatively tiny fraction of his total net worth. That will keep him out of jail for the next 3–5 years until he has exhausted his appeals…if he doesn’t prevail during his retrial.
2. He’s 80 years old - While a man of his wealth could theoretically live for another decade or so, it’s likely that the strains of his legal troubles have taken their toll upon Cosby and his health. The recent death of his daughter couldn’t have helped, and he is likely suffering some measure of depression from his hard-earned public legacy crumbling around him. Not knowing the state of his health personally, it would still be difficult to imagine that a healthy man would want to spend his 80s and 90s in a prison cell, much less one who has endured the rigors (self-generated, of course) that Cosby has.
3. He’s Bill Cosby - While the prosecutor made the perfunctory request that his bail be revoked and that Cosby be sent to prison immediately, the cold reality of the matter is that no prison wants Bill Cosby as an inmate. Not only would he present a major security headache (after all, there are racists and losers who in attempting to make a name, who would try to harm him), the curiosity factor would mean an increased strain on security. Additionally, Cosby, being a wealthy man, means that ANY mistakes or failures on the part of the correctional staff mean that his army of attorneys can bury the prison system in legal filings. The longer that Bill Cosby stays out of prison, the “happier” the prison system will be.
4. He’s Bill Cosby #2 - While the entertainment community and the majority of the Black community have largely remained on the sidelines during Bill Cosby’s trials, that won’t be the case if he ends up in prison. Important people will be concerned with his safety, and that will put extreme amounts of pressure on the prison system. Additionally, while the American Black community has not viewed his trial as being a racial issue, if or when Cosby entered the prison system, they WOULD view his treatment there as potentially being one. Few bureaucrats want (or need) world famous celebrities disparaging them and their institutions in the media as that is certainly a means to their careers ending.
5. It serves little purpose - Bill Cosby is 80. He won’t be “reformed” by a prison stay at the end of his life. He won’t be “punished” to any significant degree, as his wealth and fame will insulate him from the worst of that. He’s already been disgraced by the entire proceeding and his public stature being reduced. Even he lives for another decade or so after he might be incarcerated, he certainly won’t be spending it in prison as health concerns and the costs defend the system against the litigation that his family will file, would strain an already tenuous budget even further. And finally, his incarceration won’t be a deterrent to anyone. Basically, sending him to prison might satisfy his victim and others who claim that he also victimized them. However, their wants and needs aren’t serious metrics that would be used in any determinations concerning his imprisonment.
When you look at the matter pragmatically, Bill Cosby was tried and sentenced at least 15–20 years too late for his incarceration to be a certainty. At 80 years of age, he would have likely have only 5–15 years left to live, with most of that time suffering from a variety of illnesses and ailments. He would need to be held in a prison hospital ward, under heavy guard, and his security at whatever institution that houses him would paramount. His stay would also be scrutinized by his wealthy (and potentially litigious) family as well as a media and celebrities who would be concerned about his condition.",0

Who cares what he thinks?,"Assuming that he survives until his appeals run out and he is eventually imprisoned, it would likely be for a few months or perhaps 1–2 years at most.

1443235381546295299,@TMZ Bill Cosby is a sex offender who got off on a technicality.  Who cares what he thinks?,Why?,0
1443235381546295299,@TMZ Bill Cosby is a sex offender who got off on a technicality.  Who cares what he thinks?,"1. He’s worth $500 million - Not drug money; REAL MONEY. That means that he could conceivably bankroll a series of appeals that could set legal precedents in the United States. He can employ the titans of the criminal defense world; and he could do so for a relatively tiny fraction of his total net worth. That will keep him out of jail for the next 3–5 years until he has exhausted his appeals…if he doesn’t prevail during his retrial.
2. He’s 80 years old - While a man of his wealth could theoretically live for another decade or so, it’s likely that the strains of his legal troubles have taken their toll upon Cosby and his health. The recent death of his daughter couldn’t have helped, and he is likely suffering some measure of depression from his hard-earned public legacy crumbling around him. Not knowing the state of his health personally, it would still be difficult to imagine that a healthy man would want to spend his 80s and 90s in a prison cell, much less one who has endured the rigors (self-generated, of course) that Cosby has.
3. He’s Bill Cosby - While the prosecutor made the perfunctory request that his bail be revoked and that Cosby be sent to prison immediately, the cold reality of the matter is that no prison wants Bill Cosby as an inmate. Not only would he present a major security headache (after all, there are racists and losers who in attempting to make a name, who would try to harm him), the curiosity factor would mean an increased strain on security. Additionally, Cosby, being a wealthy man, means that ANY mistakes or failures on the part of the correctional staff mean that his army of attorneys can bury the prison system in legal filings. The longer that Bill Cosby stays out of prison, the “happier” the prison system will be.
4. He’s Bill Cosby #2 - While the entertainment community and the majority of the Black community have largely remained on the sidelines during Bill Cosby’s trials, that won’t be the case if he ends up in prison. Important people will be concerned with his safety, and that will put extreme amounts of pressure on the prison system. Additionally, while the American Black community has not viewed his trial as being a racial issue, if or when Cosby entered the prison system, they WOULD view his treatment there as potentially being one. Few bureaucrats want (or need) world famous celebrities disparaging them and their institutions in the media as that is certainly a means to their careers ending.
5. It serves little purpose - Bill Cosby is 80. He won’t be “reformed” by a prison stay at the end of his life. He won’t be “punished” to any significant degree, as his wealth and fame will insulate him from the worst of that. He’s already been disgraced by the entire proceeding and his public stature being reduced. Even he lives for another decade or so after he might be incarcerated, he certainly won’t be spending it in prison as health concerns and the costs defend the system against the litigation that his family will file, would strain an already tenuous budget even further. And finally, his incarceration won’t be a deterrent to anyone. Basically, sending him to prison might satisfy his victim and others who claim that he also victimized them. However, their wants and needs aren’t serious metrics that would be used in any determinations concerning his imprisonment.
When you look at the matter pragmatically, Bill Cosby was tried and sentenced at least 15–20 years too late for his incarceration to be a certainty. At 80 years of age, he would have likely have only 5–15 years left to live, with most of that time suffering from a variety of illnesses and ailments. He would need to be held in a prison hospital ward, under heavy guard, and his security at whatever institution that houses him would paramount. His stay would also be scrutinized by his wealthy (and potentially litigious) family as well as a media and celebrities who would be concerned about his condition.",0

Who cares what he thinks?,"Assuming that he survives until his appeals run out and he is eventually imprisoned, it would likely be for a few months or perhaps 1–2 years at most. A judge would have to take that into consideration during sentencing and they would likely hand down a term that reflects the ugly realities of matter.

Any media who gives coverage to that POS are nothing but ratings whores.,"Bill Cosby has filed legal papers seeking a refund on the money he paid to one of his sexual assault accusers, alleging the woman broke their confidentiality agreement. The philandering funnyman is asking a court for “sanctions” against Constand, saying the former basketball manager at Temple University violated the terms of her hush money. In a new court filing that refers to Quaaludes as “disco biscuits,” Cosby claims Constand and her lawyers “are intent on reneging on what they promised (him) – confidentiality and finality.” He says the push by Constand to have his full deposition released is a breach of their 2006 settlement. She wants to “have her cake and eat it too,” he claims. He ominously suggests Constand might be required to “disgorge some or all of the money paid to her by defendant as part of the settlement.” Cosby’s new filing accuses Constand’s camp of helping leak the full deposition to the New York Times in recent days because it failed to inform its private court reporting service of the confidentiality clause. “That conscious neglect has led directly to a colossal breach of that confidentiality,” Cosby’s filing states. He points out that Constand isn’t trying to toss their full agreement, just the privacy pact. “Obviously, she wants to keep what she was paid,” his filing states.",0

Any media who gives coverage to that POS are nothing but ratings whores.,"My honest opinion about Bill Cosby is that he was found guilty by a peer of jury of 7 men and 5 women and he was convicted in spite of his 400+ million dollar net worth. By his own admission he gave quaaludes to women so as to have sex with them, which , regardless whether they willingly or not took, they were raped, since they didn’t consent to sex with him, which is illegal by definition of law. No doubt seeing an 81 year old man , practically blind, who in addition has lost two children go to prison is sad but at the same time he had been raping women for decades!!!! Andrea Constand was compenasated for financially with 3.5 million $ so her motives were not financial. She is a true sex abuse victim and not a gold digger hence she pursued a criminal trial as no civil settlement prevents prosecution or conviction and NO criminal trial can be settled out of court. She wanted justice and justice was served. My honest opinion based on judicial documents and court testimonies is that a jury of peer found Bill Cosby guilty and deservingly so. I do believe that some of the accusers might have jumped on the bandwagon and falsely accused him for financial gain but not all 62 women are lying. ﻿Out of the 62 accusers, the judge dismissed 30 female accusers on the basis of made-up stories tied to Bill Cosby.﻿ But, Andrea Constand is openly gay,she was in a relationship with another woman and she was 37 years younger than him. Why would she want to have sex with him? Also, it is not a race thing as half or more of the accusers were black. I honestly think Bill Cosby is a predator and his wife is clearly in denial.

For hundreds of years in America’s history, if a black man was accused of rape he could expect death and an unfair trial, if any trial at all, whereas white men were permitted to rape enslaved women. But it’s always been hard to prosecute a powerful person of anything, especially rape and sexual assault. Cosby’s victims were initially regarded as attention hungry liars until Hannibal Burress brought the accusations into public light.

 * Rick Scott is pretty senior, might run for POTUS, and is certainly more evil than Mitch. He is one of the leaders of the death cult that is gaining in the Republican party.
 * Tom Cotton is only 44, and may be the most blatantly racist of all the senators.
 * Rand Paul is just so fucking annoying. He is also a leader of the death cult.
 * Josh Hawley wants to create a theocracy and is in favor of domestic terrorists. And he’s only 41 - he will be around a while. Probably the most obviously anti-American of all the senators.
 * Jim Inhofe is probably doing the most to render the planet inhospitable to human life. But he’s 86.
 * Ted Cruz. Come on. Everybody hates Ted Cruz.
 * Ron Johnson. Another candidate for most anti-American. And he plans to run for POTUS.

Instead of using her position as one of the few people from this marginalized community to achieve mainstream success to push the boundaries of what’s deemed acceptable for mainstream success—like Beyoncé has done with Black history, art, and culture—she’s gotten progressively more bland, less provocative, and more committed to straight-people apologia.",0

I shed literal tears when Barack Obama gave her the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2016. He reminded those of us who weren’t conscious during her coming out “how important it was, not just to the LGBT community, but for all of us, to see somebody so full of kindness and light—somebody we liked so much, somebody who could be our neighbor, or our colleague, or our sister—challenge our own assumptions, remind us that we have more in common than we realize, push our country in the direction of justice.”",0

Stop trying to force your agenda into the mainstream,"The thing that I’m wondering now, and have been for a while, is whether Ellen is still pushing our country in the direction of justice. What is she doing, as the lesbian whose life and livelihood is least threatened by homophobia, to advance and protect LGBTQ people in America when she tells her largely straight viewership that the gay people who were hurt by Kevin Hart are more powerful and mean—”haters,” she called them—than Kevin Hart? I’m sure you’re familiar with the phrase “the personal is political.” If she is, as alleged, treating her lower-paid employees like expendable nuisances and fostering a working environment that tolerates racism and sexual harassment, that reflects poorly on her both personally and politically. Also, in that Obama statement, he touches on the persona that’s now being broadly called into question: the veneer of amiability and inoffensive humor (and, implicitly, I believe, forgiveness for people at various and sundry points on their journeys away from homophobia) that was essential to Ellen’s reentry into the public graces after she was shunned for being gay. If that image of a nonthreatening gay was the key to her acceptance by mainstream America, I wonder whether that’ll change in light of the terrible allegations of the working environment on her show.",0

Stop trying to force your agenda into the mainstream,"November 22, 2016, was one of those rare days on the internet when so many people I knew — queer friends, relatively square relatives, a bunch of random straight people who went to my high school — were all sharing the same video: Ellen DeGeneres, in tears, accepting a Presidential Medal of Freedom from then-president Barack Obama. “It’s easy to forget now just how much courage was required for Ellen to come out on the most public of stages 20 years ago,” Obama said before bestowing Ellen with her medal. “What an incredible burden that was to bear — to risk your career like that — people don’t do that very often. And then, to have the hopes of millions on your shoulders.” Obama, visibly emotional, was referring to the era of Ellen’s iconic “Yep, I’m Gay” Time cover in 1997, published the same year her character on her eponymous sitcom came out of the closet. Though “The Puppy Episode” was one of the show’s highest rated, Ellen was given a parental advisory warning and, soon after, canceled; Ellen herself received intense homophobic backlash, putting her mostly out of work for years, before she bounced back as the voice of Dory in Finding Nemo. Obama lauded her for taking such a risk, which would eventually pay off; she became the most visible, and beloved, lesbian celebrity of her generation — perhaps of all time — and by doing so, “pushed our country in the direction of justice.”",0

Ellen has also built a media empire on the power of her near-universal likeability — no small feat for a gay woman who grew up as a Christian Scientist in Louisiana and Texas. On the day she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, I marveled at the diversity of her admirers — from a woman I used to date who, facing pressure from her conservative Southern family, went back into the closet and married a man to my partner’s mom, a retired Wyomingite who credits Ellen for making her own child’s coming-out easier for her to understand and accept.",0

For 20 years, she’s been a goofy, gentle, funny reminder to the mainstream that gay people aren’t so radically different from everybody else; plus, they’re responsible for so much of the best of pop culture. She has become a personal First to a mind-boggling number of everyday Americans — the first lesbian they knew by name, the first lesbian they learned to love. Ever since, her work has relied on her ability to connect across the widest possible audiences. In both her stand-up — she just released her first comedy special in 15 years, Relatable for Netflix — and in her interviews with regular people and mega-famous celebrities alike, she focuses on our human commonalities. By presenting a palatable vision of lesbianism for the widest possible audience, she’s become one of the most important modern figures in the fight for mainstream gay acceptance. But that message — one of wholesome respectability, of universality, of “gay people are just like you” — has fallen out of favor these days with certain more radical groups within the LGBT community. For some, it was never in favor to begin with.",0

Stop trying to force your agenda into the mainstream,"Acceptance narratives led to marriage equality and gay people in the military, put more queer characters on television, and launched a few out public figures — like Ellen herself — into positions of remarkable power. But acceptance of LGBT people has also rarely extended beyond the bounds of the sort of gay person Ellen represents: white, wealthy, desexualized, monogamous; neutered and relatively nonthreatening. And acceptance — like relatability, which supposedly leads to tolerance — is, for some, losing its luster at a time when assimilating queer people into an anti-queer mainstream seems increasingly like settling for the straight world’s scraps. Acceptance has been all about getting (some of) us in the door of the world as it is, rather than daring to tear down existing institutions and consider something new. Something better. All of that is to say: Some queer people have grown wary of the lure of relatability (myself included). But Ellen hasn’t. Her Netflix special — and her recent championing of Kevin Hart, who she thinks should host the Oscars despite his bungled apologies for his history of anti-gay jokes — indicates that Ellen still seems to believe in the power of relating to one another almost by default. There is much to be admired about this philosophy, one that helped Ellen regain her career and, in the process, destigmatize and demystify gay people during a crucial period in the LGBT rights movement. But both Ellen’s Netflix special and the Kevin Hart incident also reveal the limits of that philosophy today. (Through her representatives, Ellen hasn’t responded to requests for comment on this story.) Yes, we all have a shared humanity. But there is so much more that we don’t share — race, education level, class, marital status, ability, gender identity, the list goes on — and those are the things that directly contribute to our ability to succeed and survive in this world. Attempting to erase or downplay those differences can make room for individual successes but won’t actually do much to chip away at inequality at large; rather, those attempts tend only to obscure inequality’s real roots. But for 20 years, the quest for relatability has been Ellen’s bread and butter. She’s no longer someone for whom relying on relatability is a means of personal and professional survival — she’s an incredibly wealthy and incredibly powerful cultural figure, someone who seemingly has nothing left to prove. And yet she’s still insisting, despite her accrual of power and all evidence to the contrary, that she (along with her celebrity friends like Kevin Hart) is really just like you.",0

Stop trying to force your agenda into the mainstream,"Her success as a stand-up comic led to her own sitcom, the Seinfeld-esque Ellen (originally called These Friends of Mine, which was changed after the first season to avoid confusion with Friends). Ellen played the title role, Ellen Morgan, a worrywart Los Angeles bookshop owner. Her character was goofy and charming but also plagued by a need to be liked. In a third-season episode, she goes to desperate lengths to throw a well-received dinner party for Martha Stewart. (It doesn’t go well.) In 1996, she made her big-screen debut in the disastrous Mr. Wrong, an “uncharming and unfunny black comedy.” With that flop behind her, she began petitioning ABC to let her character on Ellen come out. Throughout the fourth season, the show began to drop hints that Ellen was gay. Eventually, the real Ellen and her character would come out together — Ellen DeGeneres on the cover of Time and, a couple weeks later, in an interview with Oprah Winfrey, hours after which Ellen Morgan would come out to Laura Dern’s character on Ellen. “The Puppy Episode,” in which Ellen accidentally leans into a microphone and tells an entire airport terminal that she’s gay, was watched by more than 36 million people, three times the show’s regular ratings. Mark Driscoll, an executive producer for the show’s fourth season, told Hilary Weaver at Vanity Fair, in a story marking the 20-year anniversary of Ellen’s coming out, that “Ellen was so loved by audiences; she was so much the girl next door and so sweet. She was the perfect person to dispel people’s fears about what a gay woman might be like.”",0

Stop trying to force your agenda into the mainstream,"“The Puppy Episode” title was a red herring — Disney–ABC didn’t want the episode to get leaked after a year of speculation about Ellen’s character. The title was also a reference to executives who were antsy for Ellen to come out since she’d spent four years on the sitcom without being in a relationship. As she told viewers on her talk show in 2017, someone at the studio originally responded: “Well, get her a puppy, she’s not coming out.” Plus, she joked, calling the episode “Ellen Throws Her Career Away” seemed too on the nose. Watching Ellen in her 1997 Oprah interview now is sobering. Audience members expressed concern that coming out meant that Ellen was “flaunting” sex, and that God says homosexuality is wrong. One woman, raising her voice, claimed she and other straight people were being “stuffed with this down our throats,” to which Ellen replied: “You don’t have to fight for anyone to embrace you.” The woman kept on going: “You want to know I’m straight? I’m not out on the cover saying, ‘Yep, I’m straight.’ Who cares?” Ellen, during a moment in which basically anybody else would have buckled under the pressure with despair, whipped out a joke: “Time’s been asking how to get in touch with you, actually.” A year later, after its fifth season, the first television show with an out gay character as its lead was canceled by ABC. Entertainment Weekly ran a cover story with the tagline: “Yep, She’s Too Gay.” On Primetime Live in 1998, Diane Sawyer said that the “great experiment” was now over: “Did she torpedo her own show by pushing a gay agenda, or did this network pretty much abandon her?” Primetime investigated all the episodes from the fifth season and determined that 13 out of the 21 episodes were primarily about gay themes, which led Sawyer to her first, bonkers question for Ellen: “How gay was the show?”",0

Stop trying to force your agenda into the mainstream,"“The subjects that we dealt with were the subjects any other show on television deals with,” Ellen said, smiling a little, looking uncomfortable. “All the things you go through when you feel something for another person.” “Thirteen out of twenty-one,” Sawyer said, pushing Ellen about risking the “comfort levels” of a mass audience. “Too many?” “No,” Ellen said, arguing that “you can’t just come out and then go back in the closet and not show anybody anything.” Sawyer — who, to her credit, did ask tough questions of ABC President Robert Iger about the decision to cancel the show in the same episode — also asked Ellen whether she’d rather be a pioneer than have her show renewed. “Yes,” Ellen said. “If I just had this one year of doing what I did on TV, I’ll take that over 10 more years being on a sitcom and just being funny.” She wasn’t just being criticized by the press, or by straight audiences who felt that the reality of Ellen’s life was being “shoved down their throats” — other prominent LGBT celebrities told Ellen that her show was getting “too gay” at the expense of entertainment, including Chaz Bono, who was the media director of GLAAD at the time. He told Variety in March 1998 that Ellen “has gone in a totally different direction than she said she would. Originally, she said this wasn’t going to be the ‘Gay Ellen Show,’ that every episode wasn’t going to deal with gay issues.” But since the new season dealt with gay themes, ABC felt betrayed. “We have to be realistic,” he added. Accused of being “too gay” by ABC, by the mainstream, and even by LGBT advocates and organizations, Ellen attempted to convince naysayers, as she did on Primetime, that she was simply reflecting the realities of her own life.

Stop trying to force your agenda into the mainstream,"Those who follow tabloids, blind items, and other Hollywood gossip more closely than the average pop culture consumer tend to be aware of those rumors. But the overwhelming majority of Ellen’s audience sees her as a charming, funny lady who loves to dance. And that broader reputation — as someone who’s exceedingly nice, who frequently encourages her audience to “be kind to one another” — is what Ellen set out to complicate with her special. And after decades spent trying to convince an unwilling mainstream that she is, in fact, a kind, normal, relatable person, she ended up in a sort of prison of her own making. That pressure she says she faces to be nice all the time is perhaps the most revealing part of Relatable, and it isn’t actually relatable at all. “I cannot do anything unkind now, ever,” she says. “I’m a human being, I have bad days, but I can’t do the things you do because I’m the Be Kind girl.” We plebeians can honk if we get pissed off in traffic, but Ellen? “I can’t honk ever.” Plus, people keep asking her to dance — something she stopped doing on her show a couple of years ago, agonized over what that might mean for her audience — even though the whole dancing thing was never really part of the plan. When we non-celebs do something stupid, who cares? But “when I do something stupid,” Ellen says, “it’s a story.” Ellen revealed a similar wariness of the press in the Times profile, when she relayed some advice about interviews she said that her wife, Portia de Rossi, gave her: “Just remember, the nicer they are, the more they are going to screw you.” Ellen rarely sits for interviews. She’s seemingly suspicious of celebrity reporting, something she, like other celebrities, doesn’t have to rely on much at all anymore. John Herrman documented the decline of access journalism in a 2015 story for the Awl, describing a social media–influenced “media death spiral”: “loss of power resulting in a loss of access resulting in further loss of power.” Celebrities don’t need to grant publications access to their thoughts or their content when they can speak directly to audiences through their own curated accounts; Ellen not only has humongous social media followings, but she even has her own publishing platforms. Gone are the days when she’d have to rely on Diane Sawyer asking her absurd questions to get her message out in the world. It makes total sense that Ellen would be suspicious of celebrity journalism. Before and after she came out, intense media speculation about her sexuality, as well as criticism that she was “too gay,” sent her into a deep depression and nearly destroyed her career. But there could be more to it than that. After the Kevin Hart controversy, Who? Weekly’s Bobby Finger wrote on Twitter: “One reason celebs like Ellen have become as insufferable as they are is because the rise of no-hate cultural/entertainment journalism has made famous people less capable of handling criticism. When all the most viral pubs do is call you a kween and make you hold puppies, you probably lose the ability to recognize the fact that you... make mistakes?”",0
1443003404775829504,@Williesillie2 Um are you suggesting Ellen DeGeneres is gay? Stop trying to force your agenda into the mainstream,"It’s hard to ignore Ellen’s mistake this time. She invited Kevin Hart onto her show so that he could address why he stepped down from hosting the 2019 Oscars. In December, Hart began deleting old anti-gay tweets that had resurfaced following the news that he had been selected as the next Oscars host. One tweet from 2011: “Yo if my son comes home & try’s 2 play with my daughters doll house I’m going 2 break it over his head & say n my voice ‘stop that’s gay.’” After being given an ultimatum from the Academy — apologize or we’ll rescind the offer to host — he chose to step down, originally writing a post on Instagram saying that he loves everybody, and “If you choose not to believe me then that’s on you.” Hart did not offer an apology in that post. (This week, after his criticized appearance on Ellen, he formally apologized for the tweets.) On her show, Ellen allowed Hart to monologue at length about how he doesn’t have a homophobic bone in his body. Here’s her mistrust of the press again: She called the critics who’ve written arguments about why Hart should not host — including black queer people and critics — “haters,” relegating them to “a small group of people being very loud.” She insists that she, meanwhile, is part of “a huge group of people who love you and want to see you host the Oscars.” Ellen choosing to die on this particular hill has garnered plenty of pushback. Many journalists, including BuzzFeed News’ David Mack and Megh Wright at Vulture, have documented the ways in which Ellen failed to “challenge [Hart] on the facts one bit.” Alison Herman, writing for the Ringer, argued that the interview isn’t a conversation “between a gay comedian and a straight one working out their differences. It’s between one insulated celebrity and another, bonding over what they have in common.”",0

Stop trying to force your agenda into the mainstream,"Much to her credit, Ellen doesn’t always completely cede the floor to other public figures. In 2008, she famously pushed Sen. John McCain about his stance against same-sex marriage. And in 2015, she called Caitlyn Jenner out for her evolving views on the same subject (in Jenner’s 2017 biography, she accused Ellen of deliberately misleading her and taking her comments out of context). And before the Kevin Hart debacle, Ellen canceled at least one guest appearance for reported anti-gay comments: Kim Burrell, a singer and pastor who worked with Pharrell Williams on the soundtrack for Hidden Figures and who had recently given an anti-gay sermon. But Hart also wasn’t the first time that Ellen allowed a celebrity to speak, unchallenged, about their reportedly anti-gay comments. In 2015, Matt Damon had just done an interview with the Guardian in which he had said, “Whether you’re straight or gay, people shouldn’t know anything about your sexuality because that’s one of the mysteries that you should be able to play.” On The Ellen DeGeneres Show, he explained that “I was just trying to say actors are more effective when they’re a mystery,” and that someone picked it up and implied “I said gay actors should get back in the closet.” Ellen told him someone had mentioned the interview to her that morning, but “I know you, and I know you’re not that guy.” Damon, to a sympathetic Ellen, condemned “the blogosphere” in which “there’s no real penalty for just taking the ball and running with it. You’re just trying to get people to click.” There’s certainly truth to that — since long before the internet, tabloids and the more mainstream press alike have relied on salacious cover lines about celebrities to entice readers. Ellen is all too familiar with that approach. But what’s disappointing about watching two ultra-famous people commiserating with each other about bad press is that both Ellen and Damon seem to be lumping both good- and bad-faith criticism under the gigantic umbrella of the “blogosphere.” And however he intended them to sound, Damon’s comments do reflect the opinions of many powerful people in the entertainment industry who can keep lesbians, like Ellen 20 years ago, from pursuing their dreams. It would have been nice if Ellen explored that systemic topic a little more, rather than just assuring her individual friend he’s a good guy. But ironically, daytime talk shows like Ellen’s are, in fact, the ultimate vehicles for contextless quotes by powerful people.",0
1443003404775829504,@Williesillie2 Um are you suggesting Ellen DeGeneres is gay? Stop trying to force your agenda into the mainstream,"One of the other snags in Ellen’s relatability shtick: She has been criticized for occasionally getting a little too aggressive in some of her celebrity interviews, particularly with women. There’s Taylor Swift, who’s been on the show many times; Ellen has grilled an increasingly uncomfortable-looking Swift about the men she’s dated. She also had a strangely antagonistic interview with Corinne Olympios from The Bachelor in 2017, when Ellen asked her if what we saw on The Bachelor was the real her, and if there were any sides of her we didn’t see — though “we did see the front side,” Ellen said, gesturing at her own chest. (That same year, Ellen would be criticized for misogyny after making a joke about Katy Perry’s breasts.) When Olympios said that she thought audiences would see “a lot more of Corrine” going forward, Ellen asked her, “In what way do you mean that?” to audience laughter. “Clothed,” Olympios clarified. Ellen asked her about watching the episodes now: “Don’t you think you were crazy?” She also asked her if she was drunk during filming. Later, in a podcast interview, Olympios was asked to respond to rumors that Ellen is “not so nice” and doesn’t like to be looked in the eye. “I love Ellen so much — I thought it would be like talking to Dory, and I was really excited,” she said. “And she made me so uncomfortable, unfortunately. I kept this in for so long, but to be honest she just made me a little uncomfortable.” When asked to clarify, Olympios said, “She’s very aggressive — she was very cold when I saw her before the show, which I don’t think I was supposed to, because everybody got very nervous when we bumped into each other and you could tell they were like, ‘Oh, shit.’” Ellen also has a legendary feud with fellow comic Kathy Griffin, who, in her 2016 book, wrote about a “beloved daytime talk show host” with short blonde hair and a “mean streak that all of Hollywood knows about” — she said in promotions for the memoir that she was indeed referring to Ellen. After the book came out, Griffin says, she got an angry call from Ellen, after which she “sobbed like a baby.” But despite the missteps, rumors, and occasional head-turning interviews — inevitabilities, perhaps, in a decades-long career — Ellen’s star hasn’t dimmed. Now 60, she remains as beloved as ever. As Jason Zinoman put it in last month’s Times profile, “No other current daily host has been as successful or celebrated.”",0
1443003404775829504,@Williesillie2 Um are you suggesting Ellen DeGeneres is gay? Stop trying to force your agenda into the mainstream,"With Relatable, Ellen wanted to show her long-held audience a different side of herself; as her brother Vance DeGeneres put it, “She wanted to break out of, not a rut, but a mold.” The result is a special that sees Ellen acknowledge the reputation she’s built as the “Be Kind girl” and her attempts to subvert it — but, at the same time, she recognizes that she can’t truly escape its hold on her. She’s grown tired of being expected to dance, and yet, in her special, dance she does (though just a touch more salaciously than she’d be able to get away with on daytime TV). She’s tired of being expected to be nice, but the special ends on a purely earnest, sincere note about how much her coming out 20 years ago still affects her, and why it’s important that we see beyond each other’s differences. In the end, we’re left with a comic who’s seemed to have grown tired of the expectations placed upon her — so many of which resulted from casual homophobia along with full-blown bigotry — and yet she’s still unable to entirely shake free of those expectations. Yes, she says “fuck” once in this special, and she has some winky bits about her wealth and her marriage, but she seems trapped between trying to do something edgier, something new, and not losing the mainstream she’s worked so hard to gain. In the end, it’s an approach to comedy, and to queer storytelling, that feels out of step with the current cultural moment. Another masculine-of-center lesbian comic, Hannah Gadsby, has been making waves with her 2018 Netflix special, Nanette. In it, she takes the opposite approach to Ellen’s sweeping, universal, “relatable” observational comedy — instead, she gets extremely specific. Gadsby, in addressing anti-gay bias, doesn’t attempt to convince her audience that she is just like everybody else; rather, she calls attention to everything about her own experiences growing up as a butch lesbian in Tasmania that made her different and therefore marked her as a subject for assault and abuse. She calls out “gender-normals” who assume she’s a “fat dyke who’s dead inside.” Gadsby goes as far as to question stand-up comedy itself, a form that she worries might only lead her to further subjugation. Nanette explicitly rejects the politics of acceptance, of tolerance, of relatability, of “love is love” messaging as a cure for anti-gay bigotry. Ellen takes a different approach. Though, she told the Times, she loved Nanette, she considers it more of a solo show than a stand-up set, and she disagrees with Gadsby’s critique of the form: “I think comedy is the best medicine.”",0
1443003404775829504,@Williesillie2 Um are you suggesting Ellen DeGeneres is gay? Stop trying to force your agenda into the mainstream,"At the end of Relatable, Ellen talks about her struggles with being closeted and her decision to come out, which she described as one of the hardest parts of her life. She draws a direct connection between being misunderstood as a gay person and as a celebrity, referencing an earlier bit in the special in which she jokes about how far she has to do the “bath mat scoot” to get to her towel in her gigantic rich-person’s bathroom. “We wanna grow, we wanna feel good about ourselves, we wanna feel proud of who we are. We’re all the same. So, whether your bath mat scoot is 50 scoots to get to the towel or three scoots to get to the towel, whether you’re gay or have dry eyes” — another reference to an earlier bit — “we are all the same, and we are all relatable.” Ellen, for her part, never asked to be a gay icon. As she told Dax Shepard on his podcast last year — another comfortable celeb-on-celeb environment — after she came out, she faced a lot of criticism, even from other gay celebrities. “Elton John said, ‘Shut up already. We know you’re gay. Be funny.’ I had never met him and I thought, ‘What kind of support is that from a gay person?’ But everybody assumed I was just nonstop talking about it. It hurt my feelings.” “I didn’t want to be a leader,” she said. “I didn’t want to be political, and I didn’t want to be an activist; I just wanted to be free from a secret. That’s all I wanted.” Though she is of course “going to speak up” for LGBT causes, and thinks her own visibility provides important representation, she’s always struggled with criticism from gay people: that she is either too gay or not gay enough. “I was like, ‘I didn’t say I was your leader, and I didn’t say I have done more. I just want to be a comedian, and I just happen to be gay.’” Now, she just so happens to be a gay mega-celebrity. When I look at Ellen, I do see someone to whom I relate: a fellow white gay woman who’s dealt with anti-gay bigotry in the past but now lives a life of relative privilege; someone who makes mistakes; someone who doesn’t always know how — or even want — to speak to, or for, the entire LGBT community. And I relate to that endless struggle between wanting to be authentic and wanting to be loved. But you would hope that a 60-year-old celebrity with nothing much left to prove might have an easier time of bucking expectations — of making more room for messiness, for the sorts of rabble-rousing at which she once excelled. It’s when I look at someone who’s now using her enormous cultural reach to smooth over the messes of other mega-celebrities like her that I see someone to whom I can’t relate at all. ●",0

I mean she did break free from fear of the homophobes but she didn't fully since it was in secret. Nothing wrong with marrying in secret, if you want your privacy, you can have it. Later on, it's known she is married and the public eventually found out and Ellen never regret it or ever felt ashamed but rather happy she can be herself without judgment (there are lesbian phobes but Ellen is rich and success…so noone cares) and Married to the woman she loves.

He took what he learned and evolved it into a very consumer friendly package. So much so that the masses enjoyed his predictable and easy listening approach enough to earn him a few Grammy awards.

In the spectrum of guitarists he ranks somewhere rather short of the midway point. You have to understand that the upper echelon of players write music that is very hard for laymen to digest. Their music generally transcends genres and classifications, plus it usually requires the listener to abandon their expectations of 4/4 timing and predictable chord progressions. These elite players literally utilize every technique in the book, seamlessly weaving together sweep, alternate, hybrid and snap picking. Legato, tapping, slides, bends, pinch harmonics and flat out accuracy are just standards in their respective toolbox. Their music can be repulsive upon first listen if your ears and mind aren't properly equipped for the auditory onslaught of high technique and creativity.",0

1442965322177384448,John Mayer is the nastiest skank I’ve ever known in my life. Everything new I learn abt him is horrendously bad #skankattack,John used to come of as something of an asshole in interviews. But he uses the words “recovering egomaniac” to describe himself since joining up with Bob Weir and other enormous talents in Dead and Company. John and Bobby connect in a way that reminds me of all those Grateful Dead shows I saw with Jerry and Bobby communicating without words. Bobby and Mayer are approaching that type of bond too. I’ve heard John talk about how being a member of a band versus being his own solo act has changed the type of musician he is.,0
1442965322177384448,John Mayer is the nastiest skank I’ve ever known in my life. Everything new I learn abt him is horrendously bad #skankattack,"My advice: don’t miss a chance to see him play in whatever band or tour you can catch him. The first Dead & Company show I went to I was skeptical that a pop/bluesman born too late to have seen Jerry live could possible fill the space left in the “Dead”. But a minute into the song I realized both that Jerry was smiling down at us all and that John didn’t need to pretend to be Jerry because he is John Fucking Mayer. He’s a great vocalist too. Consider that Bob Weir could have selected any gifted guitar player to play lead in D&C but Bobby picked the guy who can carry on the tradition while bringing a fresh, modern take. Thanks for that Bobby!",0

Everything new I learn abt him is horrendously bad #skankattack,"I like his solo work too though I am not as big of a pop music fan. I liked the work with John Mayer Trio a lot. He’s got the standard pre-rock blues guitar chops, combined with pop star, and guitar hero. This qualifies him to play the spiritual lead guitarist role that attempts to fill the massive void left by Jerry Garcia. John Mayer is not Jerry Garcia. Nor was Jerry Garcia John Mayer. They are different people teach with amazing talent. Jerry was a pioneer and innovator. We may never see another musician with that ability to fill the world with sounds that deeply move and inspired a worldwide fanbase touching every Deadhead’s heart and soul. John clearly cherishes Jerry’s music and can channel a Jerry-esque sound when he wants to, or bring his own unique and considerable skills to the tune.",1

Don’t listen to anyone who tells you otherwise: John Mayer can play guitar. Sometimes his playing is profound and spiritual. John can play skillfully in many styles. He plays a song as a unique experience each time he plays it. His playing, especially experienced live in person, is moving. He used to seem like he was “hot dogging” (showing off) too often and I think he’d be willing to admit he’s still a ham onstage.

It was a Friday afternoon in early November, and the shadows were growing longer over the flat expanse of eastern Wyoming as a hard week dragged on. There had been hundreds of miles to cover and just as many hands to shake before Cheney, who was traversing the state in a road-worn SUV, sank into a booth across from me at a McDonald’s just off Interstate 25, in the town of Douglas (population: 6,280). Now, she was relishing a chocolate milkshake as she gladly held forth on her family’s new home, her father’s new heart and her own new career as a politician. In her black jeans and black sweater, with no campaign aide to monitor the interview or fend off intrusive questions, the 47-year-old Cheney seemed less an aspiring senator than a soccer mom happily juggling five kids and a tough new job. But then I asked Cheney about gay marriage, and she visibly stiffened. A frown came over her face, and she began jabbing her straw into her chocolate shake, which would go untouched for the rest of our conversation.",0
1442905254454915079,Dick Cheney is an evil son of a bitch,"Clearly, the issue was a political problem for Cheney; how could it not be for a Republican primary challenger in a deeply red state whose sister, Mary, is a lesbian who married her longtime partner last year? This summer, someone had called around Wyoming under the guise of a poll asserting that Cheney “aggressively promotes gay marriage,” a claim soon followed by a TV ad on the same theme. The attacks had forced Liz’s hand, and she had promptly issued a statement opposing gay marriage. More than two months later, she was still seething about the way she had been pushed into it. And she knew just whom to blame: Mike Enzi, the three-term Republican senator and former family friend she is seeking to unseat. “I think if Senator Enzi had any self-respect, he’d stand up and renounce it, he’d say this doesn’t have any place in Wyoming, he’d say that it’s despicable,” Cheney told me. “This is certainly being done by friends of his, by supporters of his. … And I think the combination of the ad and the push poll is clearly an effort on their part to use that issue and to do it in a way that I think is beneath the dignity of the office of a United States Senator.”",0
1442905254454915079,Dick Cheney is an evil son of a bitch,"But there was more to Cheney’s anger. Unbeknownst even to some of her closest friends and advisers, her newly announced opposition to gay marriage had caused a major rift in the famously close Cheney family, and she and Mary were no longer on speaking terms. Days after we talked it all became public, when, in a series of Facebook posts as devastating as they were surprising, Mary blasted her sister’s stance against marriage equality. “Liz’s position is to treat my family as second class citizens,” Mary wrote. “This isn't like a disagreement over grazing fees or what to do about Iran.” The public rebuke was the first communication between the sisters since August, and soon their parents, former Vice President Dick Cheney and his wife, Lynne, found themselves dragged into the imbroglio, issuing a statement defending Liz.",0

And what began as a race that seemed certain to tear apart the Republican Party in Wyoming has been transformed into something that once seemed unfathomable: the race that’s torn apart the Cheney family.",0
1442905254454915079,Dick Cheney is an evil son of a bitch,"From its earliest days, the Cheney political operation has been a family affair. In 1978, when Dick, who’d been Gerald Ford’s White House wunderkind chief of staff while still in his 30s, was making his first run for Congress back in Wyoming, 12-year-old Liz and 9-year-old Mary traveled with their dad across the state, handing out buttons and candy and generally serving as cute campaign props. “They were just very outgoing, personable children who displayed confidence and energy,” recalls Maggie Scarlett, a longtime Cheney family friend. “They were great assets.”",0
1442905254454915079,Dick Cheney is an evil son of a bitch,"Their usefulness in the family trade grew as they did—and Liz, especially, was trusted with ever more substantive political assignments. So much so that in the 2000 campaign, when George W. Bush tapped Cheney to run his vice presidential search, Cheney turned to his older daughter—who by then was a lawyer with a J.D. from the University of Chicago—to help draw up the nearly 200-item questionnaire he gave to potential veeps. And when Bush wound up picking his veep vetter as his veep (despite the fact that the vetter himself never answered that vetting questionnaire), Dick brought Liz onto the campaign, tasking her with running his debate prep team. After the election, and during the Florida recount that followed, it was Dick, Liz and two other Cheney aides who essentially built the Bush administration from scratch. Since the federal government wouldn’t hand over the traditional space for a transition office until the recount was settled, the group ran the operation from the kitchen table of the soon-to-be-vice president’s McLean, Va., townhouse, using an old beige Princess dial phone from Liz’s teenage years.",0
1442905254454915079,Dick Cheney is an evil son of a bitch,"During the first six years of the Bush administration, Liz held senior State Department posts dealing with the Middle East. But some of her Foggy Bottom colleagues believed her real job was to be the vice president’s proxy in his increasingly poisonous bureaucratic battles with Secretary of State Colin Powell and Powell’s successor, Condoleezza Rice, both of whom favored a more diplomatic and less unilateral approach to the sweeping post-9/11 “war on terror” that both Cheneys strenuously advocated. “My strong suspicion is that she was a spy for her father,” says Lawrence Wilkerson, who served as Powell’s chief of staff. “She was also less capable and less knowledgeable than she purported to be.”",0
1442905254454915079,Dick Cheney is an evil son of a bitch,"But among the vice president’s allies, Liz was viewed far more favorably. “If you spend a lot of time around politicians’ families, and particularly their kids, you come to the conclusion that most of them ought to be in cages,” says Steve Schmidt, the Republican operative who served as a senior adviser to the vice president. “But Liz wasn’t looked on by the staff as a politician’s kid meddling. She was accepted as a true colleague, and she was just a great addition, really politically savvy and smart.”",0
1442905254454915079,Dick Cheney is an evil son of a bitch,"After her father left office, with an approval rating of just 13 percent, Liz became his most crucial adviser. Although Dick said he planned to go fishing and retire from public life, Liz helped persuade him to take high-profile stands against the Obama administration on foreign policy issues and convinced him to write a political memoir, ultimately serving as his co-author on In My Time. “I was definitely, as a daughter, frustrated during moments of the Bush administration when he was being so heavily criticized and he wouldn’t speak out,” she says now. “So I thought it was very good once the administration was over for him to be out there defending the policies, because they needed to be defended.” In the process, the former vice president reinvented himself into something of a folk hero, at least to those on the right. When he made a surprise appearance at the 2010 Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington, D.C., he was greeted with cheers of “Run, Dick, run!”",0
1442905254454915079,Dick Cheney is an evil son of a bitch,"It was Liz, though, who had her eyes on elected office, and as she went about helping her dad rebuild his reputation, she also worked to construct her own. She founded the political action group Keep America Safe, which fought, successfully as it turned out, to keep the detention camp at Guantanamo Bay open. She became a cable news fixture, often going further than her father in attacking President Barack Obama—once she even accused him of finding it “fashionable” to “side with the terrorists.” Eventually she signed on as a contributor to Fox News, where she occasionally filled in for Sean Hannity. Most importantly, she started turning up more frequently in the family’s ancestral home of Wyoming, no longer just visiting her parents’ place in Jackson during the holidays and the summers, but hitting the Lincoln Day dinner circuit all over the state as she helped raise money for the state GOP. It wasn’t long before she started dropping her G’s and referring to Wyoming as “ God’s Country.”",0
1442905254454915079,Dick Cheney is an evil son of a bitch,"Her sister, Mary, by contrast, was happy to stay out of the public eye. Although she wrote a memoir, Now It’s My Turn, in 2006, her role in the Cheney political operation had always been more behind-the-scenes. She served as her father’s personal aide during the 2000 campaign and as the director of vice presidential operations during the 2004 run, but never took a job in the Bush administration. After her father left office, while her sister waged war on Obama and got ready to toss her own hat into the ring, Mary focused on a family of her own with her longtime partner, Heather Poe, and their two young children. In June 2012, she and Poe were married by a federal judge in Washington. Dick and Lynne publicly announced their daughter's union in a celebratory statement.",0
1442905254454915079,Dick Cheney is an evil son of a bitch,"Until this week’s very public disagreement, the Cheneys had succeeded for years in keeping the political and the personal in delicate balance when it came to the issue of Mary’s sexuality. Granted, that wasn’t always easy. When she came out to her parents as a high school junior, as she tells the story in Now It’s My Turn, her mother burst into tears and said, “Your life will be so hard.” (Dick, for his part, told her, “You’re my daughter and I love you and I just want you to be happy.”) By the time Bush offered Dick the vice presidency in 2000, one of his biggest hesitations, Mary writes, was about what such a move would mean for her. “Personally, I’d rather not be known as the vice president’s lesbian daughter,” Mary told him. “But, if you’re going to run, I think the country would be lucky to have you. I want to do whatever I can to help out on the campaign.” Help she did, along with Liz, and over the next eight years of the Bush administration, the two sisters, who were already close, grew even closer. To the extent Mary’s sexuality intruded into the world of politics, it only seemed to draw the sisters tighter together.",0
1442905254454915079,Dick Cheney is an evil son of a bitch,"Never more so than in 2004. That year began with Mary contemplating quitting her job on the Bush-Cheney reelection campaign because of the president’s support for the Federal Marriage Amendment, which proposed to ban same-sex marriage. As Mary recalls in her memoir, when she asked to discuss the matter with her father at the White House, Lynne and Liz joined them, and all three urged her to remain on the campaign—noting that they themselves disagreed with Bush on the issue. But they also told her they would understand and support her decision if she did resign. Mary chose to stay on and, later in that campaign, when Democratic nominee John Kerry and his running mate, John Edwards, each separately raised the issue of her sexuality during the debates, the Cheneys were furious. Lynne declared Kerry was “not a good man” and denounced his “cheap and tawdry political trick.” When Edwards debated their father, Liz and Lynne went so far as to stick their tongues out at him, while Mary glared at the Democrat and, borrowing one of her father’s famous expressions, silently mouthed the words “Go fuck yourself.”",0
1442905254454915079,Dick Cheney is an evil son of a bitch,"By the time Dick left office, it seemed clear that the Cheneys had navigated a complicated issue with no negative political consequences—and family solidarity intact. And, in the years since, it appeared the family's balancing act would only get easier: While the Republican Party remained solidly against gay marriage, public opinion—even inside the GOP—was shifting rapidly toward more friendly views about homosexuality. The rest of the country looked like it was catching up with the Cheneys.",0
1442905254454915079,Dick Cheney is an evil son of a bitch,"But living in Washington is different from living in Wyoming, a fact that Liz Cheney may not have fully reckoned with when she announced in July that she would take on Enzi in next year’s Republican primary. When Cheney jumped into the race, the assumption among the political cognoscenti was that the incumbent was in trouble. The low-key, at times lumbering 69-year-old former CPA—a politician so square and old-fashioned that he carries a briefcase onto the Senate floor, where he seldom utters a word—was presumed to be no match for the young, media-savvy, slashing-and-burning daughter of the former vice president. It was an impression Enzi himself reinforced when, upon hearing the news of Cheney’s entrance into the race, he lamented to reporters, “I thought we were friends.”",0
1442905254454915079,Dick Cheney is an evil son of a bitch,"Few, if any of the early accounts of Cheney’s candidacy even mentioned the matter of her sister, and at first it seemed her biggest problem would be dismissing the carpetbagger label. Although Cheney claims to be a fourth-generation Wyomingite, she did not live in the state—save for two years as a young girl—until 2012, when she moved her family from northern Virginia into a $1.6 million home in the tony resort town of Jackson Hole.",0
1442905254454915079,Dick Cheney is an evil son of a bitch,"Predictably, Enzi’s political operation has done everything it can to portray Cheney as an out-of-touch immigrant from the Beltway. His supporters mutter darkly about the fact that she has not sold her old home in Virginia and speculate that she will immediately move her family back once the campaign is over. One Enzi backer, a GOP political operative named Rob Jennings, even investigated Cheney’s Wyoming fishing license for irregularities—a genuine fishing expedition. He got a bite: Cheney had applied for a resident’s license, which requires the holder to have lived in the state for the previous 365 days, when Cheney had only been there for the previous 75.The information soon found its way to the Casper Star-Tribune and eventually made national headlines. “I owe you a beer if not a fee,” Jennings wrote in a thank you email to the Wyoming Game and Fish Department employee who unearthed the information.",0
1442905254454915079,Dick Cheney is an evil son of a bitch,"Even one of the Cheney children’s newfound love of barrel riding has come under attack. Since moving to Wyoming, Liz's 13-year-old, Gracie, has successfully taken up the rodeo sport, and her exploits have been featured by her mother’s Senate campaign, which is using rodeo footage of Gracie in its first television ad as a testament to the family’s Wyoming bona fides. Enzi’s backers quickly set out to dispel the rodeo feats as nothing more than “image-making,” as one put it, and some even insisted that Gracie’s horse was a rental. “If you’re going back to Virginia, of course you’re going to rent it,” one said.",0
1442905254454915079,Dick Cheney is an evil son of a bitch,"Cheney has done her best to parry these attacks. “You hear people saying ‘carpetbagger’ because they don’t want to have to talk about his lack of results,” she told me. “My family’s been here since 1907, and the idea that somehow Mike Enzi gets to decide where my home is, it’s wrong.” The horse, she went on to explain, is a full-fledged Cheney, purchased from a farm in New Mexico. (When I reported this information back to one of the Enzi supporters who’d been pushing the equine issue, the supporter instantly replied, “What, they couldn’t find a Wyoming horse to buy?”) “It’s really offensive to me as a mom and offensive to my daughter,” Cheney continued. “And if they’re stoopin’ low enough to be makin’ that kind of accusation, then they must be pretty scared of my candidacy.”",0
1442905254454915079,Dick Cheney is an evil son of a bitch,"Scared or not, with the race so heated, it was perhaps inevitable that Enzi’s supporters would come to see the issue of gay marriage as a winning one in a state where 59 percent of residents oppose it. Which is why, over the course of several nights in late August, an unknown number of Wyomingites heard from that mysterious pollster who asked, “Are you aware that Liz Cheney supports abortion and aggressively promotes gay marriage?”",0
1442905254454915079,Dick Cheney is an evil son of a bitch,"It worked, and if all these attacks have dented Cheney’s reputation, they have, in a strage way, enhanced Enzi’s. As one Republican operative with ties to Cheney told me, “It turns out Enzi’s pretty fucking ruthless.” According to a recent poll conducted for the American Principles Fund—the super PAC that aired the gay marriage ad—Enzi now leads Cheney among likely Republican primary voters 69 to 17 percent. As for the ad itself, the senator has been careful not to hinder the efforts of those who would help keep him in office. When I recently asked him if he was willing to denounce the gay marriage spots, he demurred. “They’re not mine,” Enzi said. “I don’t run negative ads, I don’t ask people to run negative ads.”",0
1442905254454915079,Dick Cheney is an evil son of a bitch,"Despite Enzi’s newfound taste for blood on the campaign trail, Cheney is determined to prove that her opponent just isn’t enough of a warrior to keep representing Wyoming in a Congress that has become more bare-knuckles partisan than ever. “Senator Enzi is a nice man, but he’s not fighting,” she says.",0
1442905254454915079,Dick Cheney is an evil son of a bitch,"Asked for an example, she points to Obamacare. Enzi, like every other Republican senator, voted against it. He also gave a Senate floor speech in 2010 that warned Obama was not telling the truth when he promised Americans that “if you like your health care, you can keep it”—a speech that recently led Fox News’s Megyn Kelly to hail Enzi as the “ Paul Revere” of the issue. But, according to Cheney, Enzi could have done more. “If you had been effective enough, eloquent enough, enough of a leader, skillful enough, whatever, you could have moved the needle, and you certainly had an obligation to do much more than you did,” she argues. “To be here three years later saying, ‘I told ya’—that to me is what happens when a senator has been there too long, and they think that sayin’ it is the same as doin’ somethin’ about it.” If Cheney gets to the Senate, she promises to be less like Enzi and more like Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), the Tea Party favorite who relentlessly campaigned for the recent government shutdown as an Obamacare protest. “You can question sort of what issue he chose to fight on,” Cheney says. “But people are really glad that Ted Cruz and [Utah Sen.] Mike Lee, that they fought. And there’s a sense of sort of nobody else standin’ up there.”",0
1442905254454915079,Dick Cheney is an evil son of a bitch,"Enzi pleads guilty to the charge that he’s not a legislative brawler. “One thing I’ve noticed from watching others is that if you put your finger in somebody’s chest and chew ’em out, it’s a little tough to work with ’em the next day,” he told me on a recent Saturday night in Laramie, where he’d come to watch—and, more importantly, work the crowd at—a University of Wyoming football game. “My demeanor has worked well for getting things done.”",0
1442905254454915079,Dick Cheney is an evil son of a bitch,"Many in Wyoming thought Enzi, who’ll be 70 when voters go to the polls for the primary next August, would retire after his third term—which is the main reason that Cheney, according to her friends, began eyeing his seat. But Cheney’s maneuvering backfired. “It released some juices in Mike that might not have been there before,” says one Enzi associate. According to several people close to Enzi, it was only after the senator realized that Cheney’s likely candidacy imperiled the chances of other Wyoming politicians who were interested in filling his seat—“people who have been out there doing a lot of hard work, paying their dues, people who Mike thought deserved a fair shot,” as one of them puts it—that he decided to seek reelection.",0
1442905254454915079,Dick Cheney is an evil son of a bitch,"And Enzi’s not the only one who’s been spurred into action by Cheney. “I’ve always had a lot of volunteers, but this time I have a lot of passionate volunteers,” Enzi told me, “They’re pushing me for more bumper stickers, more signs.” What explains their passion? I asked. “The opposition,” he replied.",0
1442905254454915079,Dick Cheney is an evil son of a bitch,"Indeed, just as Cheney’s candidacy has split her family, it’s also wreaked havoc inside the exceedingly insular political community of Wyoming—which, as the saying goes, is not so much a state but “a small town with long streets.” One early casualty is Dick Cheney’s 40-year friendship with Alan Simpson, the former Wyoming senator. After Simpson announced his support for Enzi, he says he was accosted at a charity reception by Lynne Cheney, who told him to “ shut up.” When the former second lady subsequently denied this, Simpson took to the pages of his local newspaper, the Cody Enterprise, to recount the episode in even more excruciating detail and to accuse Lynne of telling “one damn bald-faced lie.” A week later, when the former vice president and Simpson fulfilled a previously schedule joint appearance at a dinner in Colorado Springs, Colo., Cheney refused to even say so much as hello to his now-erstwhile friend.",0
1442905254454915079,Dick Cheney is an evil son of a bitch,"The Simpson kerfuffle isn’t the only example of a tattered relationship left in the wake of Liz’s campaign. “People are afraid,” says one prominent Wyoming Republican who backs Enzi, but is doing so quietly out of desire not to offend the Cheneys. “They’re just kind of dreading these calls from Dick and from Lynne asking them to support Liz.” In fact, according to one Wyoming political operative, some Wyomingites with sufficient means have decided to stay out of trouble simply by giving campaign contributions to both candidates—while privately pledging their votes to Enzi. “It’s a seismic event,” says Rob Wallace, a prominent lobbyist and Wyoming native who counts both the Cheneys and Enzis as friends. “No matter how it turns out, it’s going to leave scars for quite a while.”",0
1442905254454915079,Dick Cheney is an evil son of a bitch,"For now, though, it’s Liz Cheney who bears the most battle wounds. On a recent Friday night, she was in the finished basement of a supporter’s home in Casper—the eastern Wyoming city where her parents grew up and where her aunt and uncle still live—for a casual question-and-answer session with some local residents.

 * Destroyed the career of a CIA lifer (Valerie Plame) because her husband dared suggest that Cheney had not been entirely honest - she had been operating in foreign countries ostensibly as an employee of the State Department, and he essentially ended her career in a permanent fashion by having his toadies Novak and Libby reveal that she was, in fact, CIA

Haliburton had a large amount of oil-business which led people to be a little wary when Cheney established a secret ""Energy Task Force"", formally known as the National Energy Policy Development Group (NEPDG), for the purpose of making recommendations to President Bush on energy policy. The task force met mainly in private with several oil companies and was said to have facilitated the wholesale writing of the Energy policy by corporate lobbyists.

1442905254454915079,Dick Cheney is an evil son of a bitch,Among the first things Bush did was to begin granting Cheney unprecedented power to exercise presidential authority on a variety of matters (e.g. Executive Order 13292). Cheney has been referred to by multiple sources as the most powerful vice president the nation has ever had [ https://www.thenation.com/article/how-dick-cheney-became-most-powerful-vice-president-history/ ]. It is known that Cheney was the driving force behind a number of things that happened during the Bush presidency and perhaps even more than has been proven. The perception has been that Bush made some bad choices because he did not know any better but Cheney pushed him into making those choices because he did know better. The fact that Cheney’s former employer Halliburton did so well as a result of the Iraq invasion only seemed to prove that point.,0

This was not administration policy when he said it. There was some in-fighting within the White House immediately after but it quickly became official policy that Al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters would not be treated in accordance with the Geneva Conventions.",0
1442905254454915079,Dick Cheney is an evil son of a bitch,"Interesting question. Two reasons I think. The most important is that Bush came across as a really likable guy (and I think he probably is). He seemed to be the kind of guy you would like to have a beer with (if he still drank). Cheney seemed like more like an ideologue who was used to getting his own way -- a bully type or at least lots of sharp edges. The second reason is that Cheney came across as far more conservative and in ways that many Americans didn't like. Bush never really had much of an agenda other than protecting oil and the interests of his friends and supporters and came across as much less doctrinaire.

1442905254454915079,Dick Cheney is an evil son of a bitch,"For example, Halliburton the parent company of KBR (at the time of the Iraq War) had long held the LOGCAP contract with the US government. I believe it had been renewed by President Clinton, but had been held by Brown and Root (the BR in KBR) at various times going back to the 1960s. KBR was the de facto contractor for heavy infrastructure construction and was why no other bids were considered at the time. It’s done in advance so we don’t have to go through a lengthy due diligence process in a crisis. While Cheney was CEO of Halliburton (not the owner) during the 90s there is no evidence to suggest he had an illegal or inappropriate hand in the proceedings. The common practice of politicians bouncing in and out the public sector in eyebrow-raising ways is a legitimate concern for scrutiny, but nothing scandalous ever surfaced with Cheney.",0
1442905254454915079,Dick Cheney is an evil son of a bitch,"I think the biggest reason is simply Cheney doesn't care what people think and spends little effort tending to his public perception. One of the perks of being a Senator for Wyoming is you only have to appeal to 51% of a population of 500,000 people. Compare that being the Senator from California with a population of 40,000,000. This not only frees up a lot of political time not having to kiss babies, but allows you to take unpopular positions that your colleagues can’t.

It just hurts sometimes","Really and truthfully not very many rappers were ever actual gangsters. They are making music some of them on a huge commercial scale they are not taking breaks out of their hectic touring schedules to see what the ol set is up to and selling dime bags of weed and tagging the block. American street gangs have been made into a outlet of entertainment and pretty colors. Ive been to federal prison twice and the gangsters Ive met and seen are not rappers. The gangster lifestyle is not nearly as glamorous as your fav rappers make it sound. I may be getting a lil too deep and real and maybe your asking witch rappers are claiming to be blood and witch ones are claiming to be crips and I'm not saying there isn't rappers who at one time early in their lives were not in real ""gangs"" all I'm saying is rappers like cardi B, are not Blood gang members involved in gang activity currently. These big name rappers have to much to lose. Imagine your an actual rolling 60 gang member (crip) and young M.a. Drives by your house hanging out the window with an uZi lighting up your block. C'mon that's jus not gonna happen. Now some rappers may pretend that their rap group or whole record label mates are part of a special gang (blood) gang becuz they are all rapping bout the same label and like to wear red and their all friends but that doesn't really make them a gang. Its what is popular with the youths of America and its a marketing tech. Right now it seems to be most popular and cool to be a part of the blood gang, but I remember when it was more cool to be a crip. I remember when today's blood gang rappers were crip gang rappers. Its marketing at its best. If lil Wayne is selling records talking about blood gang shit then what are other rappers gonna try to sell records? Gangster rap is jus rap that real gangsters may or may not listen to. To an actual gangster some of the music can be disrespectful or down right ridiculous. Real gang members would not go on a very public platform and claim they are from a certain group of organized crime becuz that is illegal and they are not trying to go to jail. They are not gangsters so they can tell the world about it and glorify it. I get this question a lot and it always surprises me people still really see these super star performers as real gangsters. Gangsters are usually gangsters becuz they don't have multi million dollar record deals but if they got one I bet they'd drop their gang activitys pretty fast. Like I said there is a few rappers I know of off the top my head who were in fact at one time affiliated with a street gang but it's far less common than the rappers of the world would ever admit. As far as what rappers are representing themselves as gangsters you could say the majority are claiming blood at the moment and notable ""crips"" wud be performers such as young jezzy, snoop dogg, ect ect. Notable bloods at the moment are performers like the game, all of young money, ect. None of the main stream commercial rappers are involved with gang activitys on a day to day basis. Imagine being an actual blood member and nikki Minaj shows up to the set meeting and is sent out to tag up a geto area with blood tags I can picture her with a pink wig and some spray cans and security all around her while she spray paints a block up paparazzi following taking pix of her and stuff it jus ain't gonna happen. Once in awhile you will hear about a performer being involved in organized crime but it's much diff than the media makes it sound and honestly I think the rappers sorta like it becuz it gives them creditabilty as a street gangster. Then they become real but their not really what they are claiming to be on any level. I hate to be the one that's keeps it so real but somebody's got to. I could've played along and listed blood rappers and crip rappers but it wud be jus furthering a myth and helping fake gangsters fool the world and I'm not about that. Do I listen to their music? Yes I love rap and hip hop, but that's what it is it's rap and hip hop it's not gangsters making music. It makes kids think if they are gangsters it's gonna help them become great rappers. Isn't it a lil suspicious all these gangsters are such talented rappers as well? How does that work?",0

I find her to destroy the quality of anything with which she’s associated.,"Nancy Grace, who will soon wrap 12 storied years at HLN seeking justice so that she might scream at it, was the guest yesterday on SiriusXM’s Jim Norton & Sam Roberts, where the hosts greeted her with the same sort of eagerness and openness that Grace reserves for crimes involving young white women. Grace barely had time to say hello or plug her new book or Hallmark Channel show before Norton—never one to mince words himself—told her flat out, “I’ve had a problem with you for a long time because I felt like you were capitalizing on tragedies.” Things did not get easier for Grace from there.",0

I find her to destroy the quality of anything with which she’s associated.,"Norton and Roberts continued to hammer Grace on her long career of acting simultaneously as judge, jury, executioner, tabloid reporter, and pitchfork-wielding mob—a person in whom, as the late, great David Carr once wrote, “the presumption of innocence has found a willful enemy.” And as Norton pointed out, it’s also found a dedicated Twitter troll, with Grace often promoting her investigations into children’s deaths and their drunk, negligent moms with leading questions and catchy hashtags that double as conceptual art pieces.",0

I find her to destroy the quality of anything with which she’s associated.,"To Grace’s credit, she (or more likely her social media manager) have recently toned down her hashtag game, probably after a moment of sobering self-examination and/or picking up on the years of ridicule. But that didn’t stop Norton from asking Grace, twice, “How do you justify latching on to hashtags and things without saying you are capitalizing on dead kids?” It’s a question Grace has actually been asked before, and once again, she defended it here as a habit she first started in law school, where she would have to “condense a very difficult, convoluted case into something simple for juries.” But when Roberts then asked whether she might agree that reducing a child’s death to a pithy, often absurdist phrase could be seen as “trivializing” tragedy, Grace’s answer was as nuanced and eloquent as the way she might discuss a murdered toddler.",0

I find her to destroy the quality of anything with which she’s associated.,"Norton and Roberts continued to grill Grace on just a small sampling of her many controversies over the years—her handling of the Duke lacrosse rape case; the outrage she stirred by incorrectly suggesting The Ultimate Warrior and many other wrestlers had died of steroid abuse; the slander lawsuit she settled with Kennedy cousin and accused murderer Michael Skakel—and whether she hadn’t exploited so many of these cases and their victims for the sake of her own notoriety. She grew more and more defensive. Eventually, Grace, a person whose own guests serve as little more than scream-receptacles, and whose most recognizable catchphrase is “Cut his mic!”, shamed the hosts for inviting her onto their show with zero intention of a meaningful dialogue:",0

Norton, returning to his first question, asked whether turning murdered children into viral hashtags wasn’t exploitation, Grace responded curtly, “My program is to help solve unsolved homicides and find missing children, which we have done. If you don’t like that and you don’t like the way I do it, then don’t watch it.” She then mock-chirped, “Oops! I think your time is up. Bye-bye” before getting up and leaving the studio.",0

I find her to destroy the quality of anything with which she’s associated.,"To that, Norton offered this parting shot: “You can leave if you want; we’re not gonna kill ourselves after the interview.” It was a not-so-subtle reference to the time Grace sought to find Melinda Duckett’s missing child by hectoring her relentlessly on her show—as well as the time Toni Annette Medrano accidentally suffocated her own baby, a sensitive tragedy Grace covered by dubbing Medrano “Vodka Mommy.” After their segments, Duckett shot herself, while Medrano doused herself in flammable liquid and set herself on fire. In both cases, Grace eventually settled with their traumatized respective families out of court.",0

And it’s the general attitude she’s long displayed toward inconvenient truths in all their forms, whether it’s the withholding of evidence that led her to be reprimanded as a prosecutor; the accusations of embellishments she made to the myth-making story of her fiancé’s murder (the one that made her “a victim of a crime” herself, as she said again in both the Norton/Roberts and View interviews); or just any of the many everyday rushes to judgment that have contributed to the current toxic culture—increasingly steeped in scaremongering, combativeness, and wild, baseless speculation phrased as “just asking questions”—from which she has long profited.",0

Who can forget her showdown with the rapper 2 Chainz over marijuana legalization, or her breathless coverage of the Casey Anthony case?

2. He's bored. Creating drama relieves the tedium. He doesn't care if he's caught lying as that just creates more drama. Funzies.
3. He lacks empathy. There are several personality disorders that lack, or have low levels of, empathy, such as Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD), Antisocial Personality Disorder (APD), and Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). He doesn't care if he's hurting others and either finds it amusing, to his gain, or convenient to tell these lies (or all of the above.)
4. He's a dick. I'm not sure why people just have a hard time with this concept. There are some mean, bad, evil people out there. Don't try to psychobabble it away, some people are just dicks.
