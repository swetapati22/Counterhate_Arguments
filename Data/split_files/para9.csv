The Department of Homeland Security is the largest government agency ever constructed, as such, the GOP could not run on smaller government.

It was not a sufficient explanation to say, “Whoops,” but that is pretty much what everybody associated with the war said when it was discovered that there were no such weapons. Now, Hussein was a bad guy, an evil tyrant and a sociopath to the Nth degree. But he was no fan of Osama bin Laden, and all attempts to make the linkage were never proved and, in retrospect, were ridiculous. When you are in the fog of war, sometimes you make decisions that are incorrect. Invading the wrong country for the wrong reasons, however, goes beyond the fog-of-war excuse.",0

Will history judge him more harshly than it judges Lyndon Johnson for the Gulf of Tonkin, or McKinley for “Remember the Maine to Hell with Spain”? Time will tell. Bush’s courageous decision to authorize a “surge” in Iraq, which helped America ultimately win the war against the insurgents, on the other hand, will go down as one of his better ones. Once you are in a war, you better win it, no matter how you got in it. Historians judge winners far better than losers. about how the Tea Party rescued the Republican Party from the legacy of George Bush. “The tea party rejected his administration’s spending, overreach and immigration proposals, among other things, and became only too willing to say so. In doing this, the tea party allowed the Republican establishment itself to get out from under Mr. Bush.”",0

Bush kept us safe after the attacks of 9/11, and that is no small feat. He used every tool in his toolbox, some that may not have passed constitutional muster, but that is for constitutional historians to decide. That was his greatest triumph. His greatest failure was that in refusing to pay for the war, and by expanding the size of government instead of contracting it during wartime, Bush put us on a path that will make it harder to for us to maintain our military and financial supremacy for the long term. His unpopularity also ushered in the presidency of his successor, which has only accelerated this troubling trend. I like George Bush, and I supported him when he was president. I have many close friends who worked for him, and I did my fair share to help him when I worked for Speaker Hastert. But that doesn’t mean that I can’t look at his presidency with a fresh pair of eyes. Mr. Bush, with his new book, is basically asking us to revisit his tenure. Like most presidents, Mr. Bush had his wins and his losses, and it is really up to the historians to decide whether he was a success or a failure.

Their only hope to remain in power would have been to lift living standards once oil sales began and at some point to liberalize the economy.

The lack of any tangible rebuilding of basic infrastructure after the invasion would begin a process of spurning a civil war which by 2006 was ongoing. Iraq would be consumed by violence, for nearly a decade. At the end a weak Iraqi government would demand that U.S. troops leave in 2019, but neither does the Iraqi government have the capacity to carry this out nor does it have the economic strength to weather being parted from its oil accounts in which are deposited in a custodial account in the U.S.",0

The world was well on its way to seeing the rise of large economies which finally were reemerging from the ravages of colonialism. The invasion of Iraq took away from economic initiatives the U.S. should have done at home to build new infrastructure and retool. While the Invasion of Iraq may have provided access to inexpensive energy resources, the hydraulic fracking revolution made this far less valuable. Wrong priorities were stressed, and the root causes of global dilemmas were not explored. U.S. policies in the 1980s had supported Radicals to fight the Soviet Union in Afghanistan. The policies produced a short term gain, and like expected also produced a group of radicals which once finished with their war on the Soviet Union did not return home to live lives of peace. The change which had been needed was to stop support of radical theology. Covert operations would better have accomplished this than invasions of nations which had nothing to do with 9/11. George W. Bush simply let the war on terror become comprised either by those who saw economic opportunity or simply not understanding the history of the complex actualities of the Middle East and connected regions. Sadly both possibilities led to the same result.",0

1441522495710846982,Anne Hathaway is a bad bitch,"There have been one too many interviews of this actress (and many others of this era) turning cold and condemning interviewers for asking her how she physically got ready ready for roles, or how she felt playing a sex symbol, etc. Hathaway is a little obsessed over acting like, “how dare you discuss my body to me, this is anti-feminist, and you are reducing me to a sex symbol, let me put this man in his place”… when the plain fact of the matter is the entire planet has seen her act loose on camera, as well as dress like a hooker off camera, many times, for throwaway roles, for throwaway publicity, etc. I don’t want to hear anyone popping off anymore, like “acting like a slut is different than being one in real life, don’t be close-minded!” It takes a vapid ho to act like a vapid ho, and when you put out an image, people obviously respond to that image as you’ve forced them to see it. That’s it. When a person is using her real body to put it on display, to represent sex, and to attract sexual attention, that body is connected to her and her being. If she wants to use her body for this, as she already has, that’s fine, no one is judging; but people are obviously going to feel free and appropriate discussing “how she got fit for a role to fit into a catsuit” and shit with her at some points over the time of her slutty career, and she has no right to treat those people like shit or be confused or offended.",0

Everybody thinks you want to be talking about your body, it’s all you show us, the interviewer is responding to your public image, so if you have another one you want to show, go ahead and show it. YOU used your own tits to help you with fame, right? That was your choice. Sorry but, you people can’t just spread yourselves wide for the whole planet to see, and then try to act like you are an ‘artiste’ before you’re a flaming attention whore. If you wanted to be known for your brains or talent, then you should have entered an industry where that was the gig instead. Look at some of your award dresses, the dresses you wear to visit talk shows- those weren’t roles, you naturally force people to see your body sexualized every chance you get.",0

When people like Hathaway- or like ScarJo for another example- act offended when interviewers just acknowledge the mere SEX attached to their names and images and personae, it’s like… lol, oh just stfu. Like, it’s fine if you have a complex about it and want to live in denial, but the rest of the viewers in the world are like… um… don’t be a slut, then… Couldda been a doctor, a fire fighter, a teacher, an essayist, anything smart or respectable, right?

1441522495710846982,Anne Hathaway is a bad bitch,"The reason ""so many"" people hate Anne Hathaway is that, in reality, most of those people probably DON'T ""hate"" her.

1441522495710846982,Anne Hathaway is a bad bitch,"The narrative about people disliking her cropped up a while back, but it really started to gain traction when she was cast as Catwoman in The Dark Knight Rises, with a lot of online fan sites filling up with trash talk about her and then spread over to Facebook and elsewhere, back in January of 2011. A bit before that, during the last few months of 2010, the speculation about who would play Catwoman included frequent mention of Hathaway, and then she was screen testing and fans heard about that, and so on.",0
1441522495710846982,Anne Hathaway is a bad bitch,"So really, this anti-Hathaway narrative has really been stronger and included ""so many people"" for about two and a half years, roughly, having really gotten a foothold among teenage boys who didn't want her to be cast in a superhero movie because they wanted someone else cast in the role instead.",0
1441522495710846982,Anne Hathaway is a bad bitch,"And over the last two-and-a-half years, it has grown and become more and more of a popular sentiment, among a large number of people who probably didn't know they hated her until they heard how widespread the hate against her was. This is a simple fact of human behavior, it's why fads and trends happen, and it drives most of these exact sort of situations. Some famous person starts off beloved or doing well, but then is subjected to a sudden backlash as their popularity and success grows. Then, something happens that eventually ""redeems"" them among the majority of the haters who really weren't true ""haters"" at all, but who in fact were just members of a fad. Actors, musicians, whatever kind of fame there is, there's truth to the saying ""the public is fickle.""",0
1441522495710846982,Anne Hathaway is a bad bitch,"Why Hathaway and not other stars? There's frankly rarely a rhyme or reason to it, any number of factors just combine with chance and luck to make it happen. For Hathaway, there was the online backlash against her being considered for the role of Catwoman instead of other fanboy favorite actresses, and that caused a steady stream of hate for months, and I think that was a big part of setting off the trend. Then the media talked on and off about the supposed hate, and some of the longer-term Hathaway haters chimed in accusing her of being phoney etc, and that got traction when gossip sites and others kept the story alive, and like any narrrative that takes hold at a given time for some reasons that aren't always clear, this one kept spreading around online and getting repeated until people took it as a truth that there's some big anti-Hathaway sentiment among the broad public -- which there probably is now, because everyone kept repeating it and jumping aboard.",0
1441522495710846982,Anne Hathaway is a bad bitch,"To those factors I'd add a really important one that has to be considered, too -- people have totally different and contradicting standards by which they judge actresses and actors, and those standards are particularly skewed against young actresses. Few people ever ask the kinds of questions or make the kinds of demands of male actors as they do female actors. A young male actor who is handsome, talented, comes from a family with a history of acting, and who tries to smile a lot and acts nervous and gives speeches or comments that seem too self-serving or rehersed generally get treated like... well, they get treated just fine most of the time, so long as their smile is ""charming"" and they keep being ""handsome"" and ""talented."" Female actors who don't seem ""humble"" enough, however, get quickly labeled cold or stuck-up and other such things, because the attitude is that if a woman isn't humble enough then she's a b****. That's not just a myopic standard applied to actresses, either -- women in almost any profession get treated to similar accusations, and sadly even other women are likely to apply those standards (we're all socialized and educated etc in the same world, after all, so behaviors and attitudes and expectations spread everywhere).",0
1441522495710846982,Anne Hathaway is a bad bitch,"The vast majority of people with strong opinions against Hathaway have never seen her in real life for even a second, have never spoken to her at all, and their entire experience in assessing her and hating her is based on professional public appearances where she made prepared remarks for a short period of time. That's all, and obviously it's not rationally a basis for any reasonable person to think they have remotely enough experience or information to make a serious informed, intelligent assessment of Hathaway as a human being, unless she turned to the camera and said, ""Minorities should be segregated,"" or some other such actual assertion of morality that speaks to her personality more.",0
1441522495710846982,Anne Hathaway is a bad bitch,"So the hatred can't really be based on much valid, solid reasoning. It's at best gut feelings that all of her nice, happy, typically positive remarks are all really just ""fake,"" and that this pure guess that she's being disingenuous in her kind remarks and laughter makes her an unlikable person deserving of derision and animosity.",0
1441522495710846982,Anne Hathaway is a bad bitch,"Does that really sound like a reasonable group attitude that is spread through the public based on each person's reaction to Hathaway, or does it make more sense that the driving force behind the hatred of her for supposedly not seeming sincere enough in her positive words and her smiles is really just another typical fad buoyed by online hype?",0
1441522495710846982,Anne Hathaway is a bad bitch,"I think it's clearly the latter, and that it'll go away after the press gets bored talking about it. And when people get bored insisting they hate someone they've never met just because her smiles and nice comments don't seem ""true"" enough to them, and/or because she's famous & popular but doesn't act humble enough about it. Or rather, her constant expressions of having a severe self-esteem problem and fear of failure (including self-consciousness about her weight, about bad relationship history, and about comparisons to her mother's expectations) seem ""fake"" and so she's not REALLY humble enough, and is therefore according to her haters fake, unlikeable, stuck-up, etc. That much animosity for pretty much no good reason is hard to maintain, and so Hathaway's redemption will come eventually (maybe soon, since it's peaking right now with her Oscar win and her shocking delivery of a prepared speech at an award ceremony without enough genuine-seeming humility).",0
1441522495710846982,Anne Hathaway is a bad bitch,"Hathaway might be a cruel person who plucks the hair out of kittens and who sneers at homeless people as her limo drives her home at night. Or she might really care about the issues she's involved with such as gay rights (her brother came out of the closet to her and her family when she was young, resulting in Hathaway changing her religious association), and she might really be nice and might want to be well-liked but might be better at acting on a stage than being herself in front of a room full of people who expect her to act humble lest she be called a cold stuck-up b****. Some people are more comfortable being themselves than others, some people find it easier to express their real feelings than others, some people find it easier to deliver prepared remarks about themselves easier than others. It'd be interesting if the people who hate Hathaway for supposedly being fake and stuck-up and not humble enough etc were to just film themselves for one week, 24 hours a day, and then see if they ever come off as fake or not approachable enough or not humble enough. If they do, will they start a club hating themselves?",0
1441522495710846982,Anne Hathaway is a bad bitch,"And how many of these folks hate Robert Downey Jr. for not being humble enough? He does make good off-the-cuff remarks without having to prepare them, so does that forgive him?",0
1441522495710846982,Anne Hathaway is a bad bitch,"I don’t know her, so whether she’s nice or annoying wouldn’t bother me! It’s not like she’s in the papers or always trying to get publicity like say Meghan Markle (Who claimed wanted privacy etc)! So I don’t think Anne Hathaway even deserves such a question being posted on quora or people discussing her in such a way? I imagine lots of people think public figures are public property and therefore they are entitled to give an opinion on them when they haven’t done anything controversial to deserve such a thing? Also lots of people are jealous as celebrities get more money and a better lifestyle than they do? Also lastly, good old fashioned sexism when women are always get criticised like ‘ how dare Madonna be over 60 and still dress this way why doesn’t she give up singing and move over for younger generation? How dare Cheryl Cole have dated Liam from one direction who’s more than 10 years younger than her what a cougar! Why doesn’t lady gaga lose weight if she’s going to dance on stage’, etc. It’s stupid and uncalled for! It’s not the same as say ‘how dare Justin Bieber spit on his fans, or Meghan Markle tell lecture others not to waste and think about climate change as she goes about on her private jets, or Amber heard trying to ruin Johnny depps career accusing him of violence when evidence shows she was also abusive etc",0
1441522495710846982,Anne Hathaway is a bad bitch,So some people ask for negative attention whilst others are just living their life and doing their jobs which throws them into the spotlight which unfortunately also means some people then will dislike them for no apparent reason and think it’s ok to openly critique them.,0

""Hathaway's words of gratitude come off as way too rehearsed.""

1441522495710846982,Anne Hathaway is a bad bitch,"Bear with me as I take the celebrity thing out of context, (but not the female thing out of context) I was speaking to a friend who works in a female dominated environment and she loves her job but mentioned that all the women hated her. The men were mean too, but the women were particularly vindictive just because she didn't ""seem approachable"" or ""said hello"" when she first started. Word went round the company was that she was a stuck up beeyotch and a total snob. The truth was, she was scared shitless at starting somewhere new. When she eventually tried to reach out and build a relationship with some of the women, they shat on her even more - apparently it made her fake and annoying. It's hard to change the minds of others when they've already made up their mind about you and aren't willing to change it. It got to her for a bit and affected her work, so she told herself that she didn't care what they thought, she worked hard, loved her job and was excelling at it - she wasn't going to start apologising for her ability. What got her through the day(s) were: ""They hate me because I'm awesome."" Because, really, when everyone is working hard to bring you down, the only way you can stay standing is if you hold yourself up with some semblance of grace. Obviously this doesn't help her campaign in the slightest, the women are working even harder at tearing her to pieces with gossip and baseless complaints to her behaviour.",0

As well as running away from her initial Disney princess image? Intentionally diversifying yourself and your art takes work. Doing random shit to get attention does not. The fame is something she has come to accept as part of her job, but from the way she's carried herself, she's not comfortable with it - hence continuing putting on a show; obviously one that everyone apparently can see right through.",0

Also all of the stupid decisions and mistakes made in Afghanistan. Same with the moderates in the GOP. Cheney is the worst. Bush=Rino.,"The legacy of George W. Bush remains, much like his 2000 election, a subject of profound controversy, and any truly objective evaluation will likely be years in the future. He entered office as one of only a handful Presidents to lose the nation’s popular vote. The election of 2000 and the Supreme Court case of Bush v. Gore remain two of the most controversial political developments in the last half-century. Some thought that President Bush should begin his term by trying to find common ground and avoid controversy to take some of the edge off the nation’s polarized politics coming out of the 2000 election. Instead, as one of his first actions, President Bush issued an executive order creating the Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives, which further alienated some who thought government money should not go to organizations affiliated with churches. Yet he did reach across the aisle on other issues including the No Child Left Behind Act, which was the most impactful change in education policy in a generation.",0

Bush=Rino.,"Within nine months of taking office, President Bush was afforded the chance to unite the nation after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. By most accounts, Bush did a masterful job of speaking for and to the American people. His crisis leadership, including insisting on returning to the White House the night of the attacks instead of holing up in a safe bunker elsewhere, gave the American people confidence that someone was in charge. He became the most popular President in the history of polling, reaching an astounding 90 percent approval rating in the wake of the attacks.",0

Bush=Rino.,"Following an authorization from Congress to eliminate those who perpetrated the attacks of 9/11, Bush ordered an invasion of Afghanistan. The Taliban leadership was driven into the mountains and across the boarders into neighboring countries, including Pakistan. Those early successes, however, turned into the longest war in American history, and the President never was able to achieve the greatest symbolic goal of the effort, the killing or capturing of the mastermind of the attacks, Osama bin Laden; U.S. special forces achieved that goal in 2011 under Bush’s successor, President Barack Obama.",0

Bush=Rino.,"Following the 9/11 attacks, President Bush also presided over a restructuring of the American national security apparatus and the passage of the Patriot Act, which gave the government vast new powers in the effort to combat future acts of terror. Both efforts, especially the Patriot Act, sparked strong divisions within the American people throughout the Bush presidency. In 2002 and into 2003, Bush used the fear of further terrorist attacks to argue for a preemptive war on Saddam Hussein’s Iraq under the rationale that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. The initial attacks and invasion were extremely successful and popular but in the end no weapons of mass destruction were found anywhere in the country and a strong insurgency arose that resulted in the deaths of more than 4,000 Americans over the next eight years. The war grew increasingly unpopular, and the Democrats used it as a major wedge issue in the 2006 and 2008 elections, in which they first took over Congress and then the White House two years later.",0

Bush=Rino.,"On the domestic front, the Bush presidency scored early successes in gaining passage of large tax reductions and a major reform of the American educational system with the No Child Left Behind Act. The tax cuts, however, were not made permanent, as the President wished, and the bipartisan education reforms proved very controversial with their emphasis on testing and school report cards. The tax cuts were eventually made permanent during budget negotiations in the Obama administration but No Child Left Behind was eventually replaced with a new national education plan in 2015.",0

Bush=Rino.,"After his reelection in 2004, Bush sought major changes to Social Security, arguing a partial privatization plan could insure its solvency. He spent considerable political capital seeking such a change, but his efforts went nowhere in Congress. He also sought major immigration reforms that never materialized. As the tax cuts of 2001 reduced revenue to the government, while spending continued to increase partly due to the expensive wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the federal government racked up large deficits. Ultimately, those deficits, exacerbated by the financial recession of 2008, helped create a politically impactful insurgency on the political right that went under the banner of the “Tea Party.” The last few months of the Bush presidency were marked by a major crash of the stock market, a controversial bail out of financial institutions and car companies, and a recession that would wipe out millions of jobs and impact the U.S. economy for many years.",0

As President, Bush became a lightning rod for controversy. His controversial election and policies, especially the war in Iraq, deeply divided the American people. Arguably his greatest moment as President was his initial, heartfelt response to the tragedy of the 9/11 attacks. Soon, however, his administration was overshadowed by the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. President Bush’s place in U.S. history will be debated and reconsidered for many years to come.",0

As senator from Connecticut, George Bush would have been temperamentally and ideologically in tune with his state and party. Instead, eager to hack out his own business career, the young man took his wife, Barbara, and son, George, to the oilfields of Texas. This meant that from the day he entered politics, he would have to submerge many of his views and instincts to please an electorate that was notably more conservative than he.

Bush=Rino.,"In the case of Bush, this balancing act means acknowledging not only his positive qualities and achievements—as so many news outlets have already copiously done—but also what may have been his defining political hallmark: his cynicism. From his opportunistic criticism of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, to his 1980 election-season embrace of supply-side economics and anti-abortion politics, to his last act as president—pardoning many of the Iran-Contra crew in order to protect himself—there was a recurring tendency to place short-term gain above long-standing values.",0

As a young man, he volunteered to fight in World War II; as an old man, he undertook important post-presidential disaster-relief efforts. These and other acts showed courage and class. At times—in working with Democrats on clean-air legislation, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the 1990 deal to tame the debilitating Reagan-era budget deficits—he acted humanely and even nobly. But in this historian’s reckoning, self-interest prevailed too often over principle. My friend the historian Tim Naftali has called Bush the most underrated president of our times. I would say that what we’re now seeing proves the opposite: Bush was the most overrated president since Dwight Eisenhower, and possibly of all time.",0

Bush=Rino.,"The son of Prescott Bush, a wealthy investment banker and moderate Republican senator from Connecticut, George H.W. Bush entered politics at a moment when the GOP’s center of ideological gravity was beginning to move rightward. His career bore the marks of his struggle to square his patrimony of social liberalism and responsible statesmanship with the new demand from Republican voters for a more zealous and populistic conservatism. By launching his career not in New England but in his adopted state of Texas, where he had moved to make his fortune in oil, Bush would find himself continually pressed to sacrifice his Yankee principles of noblesse oblige and social moderation. Most famously, he did this in 1964, when running for Senate amid the great civil rights struggle. Regarded by many Texas conservatives as an Eastern carpetbagger, Bush denounced the historic 1964 Civil Rights Act that outlawed racial discrimination in schools, employment and public accommodations. At other times, as with his congressional vote in 1968 for a fair-housing bill, he incurred his constituents’ wrath. Too often though, the former choice, not the latter, served as Bush’s template in making decisions.",0

Bush=Rino.,"The willingness to put aside conviction for political opportunity resurfaced in 1980 when Bush, after running a surprisingly strong second in the 1980 Republican presidential primaries to Ronald Reagan, recanted his well-known denunciation of supply-side economics as “voodoo economics” and his long-standing pro-choice politics in order to be chosen as Reagan’s running mate. Throughout his career, Bush often said that while he might take the low road in campaigning, he hewed to his ideals while governing. But here he had done the opposite: trumpeting his true views while seeking the nomination, then abandoning them once in office. With Bush’s acquiescence to Reagan’s more conservative politics, the last hope for a restoration of Rockefeller Republicanism perished. Never again would the party boast a major national leader who defended reproductive rights or questioned the merits of supply-side economics.",0

To placate his party’s die-hards that year, he chose as vice president Indiana Senator Dan Quayle, who was anti-abortion, hawkish and opposed to new civil rights measures. (I have never seen Bush admit this, but I’ve always thought that the handsome, affable, preppy and somewhat happy-go-lucky Quayle reminded the elder Bush, consciously or unconsciously, of his own first-born son.) Quayle’s unreadiness for the presidency soon became evident, and, much like John McCain’s selection of Sarah Palin as his running mate two decades later, it was judged to be a shortsighted, irresponsible move.",0

The ironclad vow not to raise tax rates shored up support from the right, but in a time of skyrocketing deficits, it hamstrung the president after he took office. Eventually, in 1990, Democrats, who controlled the House and Senate, forced Bush to accept some new taxes as part of a massive budget compromise. The administration called them “revenue enhancements.” In his reelection campaign in 1992, Bush would renounce not the original pledge but his violation of it as his worst mistake.",0

Bush’s 1988 presidential bid has been widely deemed the ugliest in modern times. Under the tutelage of hardballers Roger Ailes, James Baker and Lee Atwater, Bush impugned the Americanism of his opponent, Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis, the son of Greek immigrants, and pandered to prejudice in making hay of Dukakis’ honorable decision to accept a Massachusetts Supreme Court judgment that deemed mandatory pledge-of-allegiance recitals in public schools to be unconstitutional. “What is it about the Pledge of Allegiance that upsets him so much?” Bush taunted. Then came the Willie Horton ads that hyped the scare-story of an African-American criminal, released on furlough from a Massachusetts prison, who raped a woman and assaulted her husband. Never mind that Reagan, as governor of California, had signed a similar furlough bill.",0

Most notably, in 1991, when Thurgood Marshall, the first black Supreme Court justice, announced his retirement, Bush could have honored his legacy by naming a respected African-American judge or legal scholar such as Amalya Kearse or Leon Higginbotham. But he selected a staunch conservative in Clarence Thomas—served up with the implausible assertion that he was the most qualified person for the job.

Bush=Rino.,"In foreign policy, Bush has generally been given higher marks, and in some cases fairly so—particularly for his management of European relations at the start of the post-Cold War era. But he also made terrible mistakes, which were likewise rooted in cynicism. As Saddam Hussein was preparing to invade Kuwait, Bush sent the Iraqi strongman clear signals, through the American ambassador, that the United States had no interest in intra-Arab disputes—the exact opposite position of the one he took very shortly thereafter, in which he drew a “line in the sand.” Bush commendably built international support for a military campaign against Saddam, but by leaving the dictator in power at the war’s end, he fobbed off the problem onto his successors. By 1998, in violation of the cease-fire agreement, Saddam was refusing to let international weapons inspectors carry out their job, making it impossible to know if he would resume a nuclear weapons program. One need not support George W. Bush’s rash decision to invade the country to concede that he was addressing a problem that his father had left—in the words of Dick Cheney, a top official in both men’s administrations—unfinished.",0

Early in 1991, Bush had actively encouraged Shiites in Iraq’s south and Kurds in the north to rise up and depose Saddam, but after the successful expulsion of Saddam’s forces from Kuwait, Bush concluded he didn’t want to see the country fractured. He declined to provide more than humanitarian aid, and tens of thousands of both groups were slaughtered or dispossessed.

As vice president, Bush had been present at key meetings about the arms-for-hostages deal that would become the Reagan administration’s greatest scandal, but he had never been fully candid about his support for the policy, insisting disingenuously that he had been “out of the loop.” Late in Bush’s presidency, special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh had learned of diaries that Bush had kept, which he hoped to introduce as evidence at Weinberger’s upcoming trial. Bush’s pardons thus shielded himself from any additional investigation. Walsh fumed that “the Iran-Contra cover-up, which has continued for more than six years, has now been completed.”",0

 * Gave tax cuts to the rich without paying for it
 * Signed Medicare Part D. A bill that made it impossible for the government to negotiate drug prices with drug companies. Making drugs only more expensive.
 * Took the United States into an unnecessary war against Iraq based on bogus claims of Saddam having weapons of mass destruction. That war completely destabilized the Middle East. We are still facing the consequences of that war.
 * Opened the Guantanamo Bay detention camp. Prisoners were indefinitely detained without trial and torture was normalized.
 * Poor response to Hurricane Katrina.
 * Signed the Patriot Act [ https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_Act ] into law

The Rest of the world Hears you, and the people who knocked these buildings down, will hear all of us soon.” thus begins the war on terror. now bush has gotten a lot of heat for this war, that now doesn’t seem to have an end to it, and some think we went for oil reserves, or something materialistic like that. ( which is B.S, in my opinion). His response gave americans hope, and someday, when he’s long gone, his words will be remembered, and you know what? some presidents aren’t as appreciated until well after they’re gone. out of everything that went on during his presidency, his speech will be engraved somewhere, i’m sure of it.",1

Notably, it is bringing back to the stage old, once-scandal-ridden politicians with checkered histories, including Newt Gingrich and Rudy Giuliani. Gingrich, the former House speaker, in particular, has a long record of misdeeds and foul statements that Mother Jones has covered for decades. We were the first media outlet to dig into his early days, when Gingrich dumped the first of his (so far) three wives and brought her divorce papers to sign while she was in the hospital recovering from cancer surgery. We have explained the ethics scandals—note the plural—that ensnared him when he was in the House. During his 2012 presidential campaign, we published “Your Daily Newt,” which featured bizarre episodes from his past. (One headline: “Your Daily Newt: Space Sex.”) But despite his past imbroglios and his failed 2012 bid, Gingrich is back in the game. With Giuliani and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, he was part of Trump’s top surrogate triumvirate. (What a coincidence—all of them have been socked by scandals involving the abuse of power.) Gingrich was mentioned as a possible secretary of state for Trump, though on Sunday he said he had no interest in that job. (The top candidates at the moment are Giuliani and John Bolton.) Gingrich has previously declared his desire, should Trump become president, to be a “senior planner for the entire federal government,” whatever that means.",0

Survey data from the early 1970s indicate that maybe a third of 18-to-25-year-olds were smoking pot. What Daniels retrospectively identifies as ""America's libertine apogee"" was in fact just the beginning of an upward trend, at least as far as drug use went. According to data from the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse, marijuana consumption among college-age Americans peaked in 1979, when half of them reported smoking pot in the previous year. The Monitoring the Future Study shows a similar trend among high school seniors. Daniels' attempt to minimize his responsibility by claiming everyone was doing it exaggerates the extent of marijuana use when he was in college.",0

Under current New Jersey law, possessing more than 50 grams (about 1.8 ounces) of marijuana is a felony punishable by up to 18 months in prison. Given the amount of pot Daniels had (enough to fill two shoeboxes), he easily could have been charged with intent to distribute, which under current law triggers a penalty of three to five years (for less than five pounds). And at the time of Daniels' arrest in May 1970, New Jersey's marijuana penalties were even more severe. Six months after his arrest, the New Jersey Supreme Court decided a case involving an 18-year-old who was caught with a tiny amount of pot (clearly just for personal use) and got a sentence of two to three years in prison. Concluding that ""the sentence was entirely too harsh,"" the court noted that state law set a minimum sentence of two years but allowed it to be suspended for a first offense. The court ruled that ""a suspended sentence with an appropriate term of probation is sufficient penalty for a person who is convicted for the first time of possessing marihuana for his own use."" Given the legal situation prior to this ruling, Daniels was incredibly lucky to get off with a $350 fine, and he was able to do so only because he did not actually plead guilty to marijuana possession—only to the lesser offense of ""maintaining a common nuisance.""",0

While libel laws differ across the states, all libel laws must conform to First Amendment protections, and in the past the Supreme Court has issued rulings protecting certain types of speech in a particularly-aggressive fashion:",0
1439730438998740994,"downsizing workforces, and breaking unions—all policies that have led to both deeper and more wide- spread poverty and more concentrated accumulations of wealth.” Newt Gingrich is a shitcunt.","1. Speech regarding a public figure: expressions over public figures are strongly protected under New York Times Co v. Sullivan, any statements made about a public figure must be made with “actual malice” to be actionable in defamation, meaning Mueller would need to prove that Gingrich made those comments “with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not”, its not enough for Gingrich to honestly but unreasonably believe his statement was true. Mueller clearly qualifies as a public figure “pervasively involved in public affairs”, which will make it very hard to succeed in his action.
2. Speech regarding matters of public interest: several Supreme Court cases demonstrate that the First Amendment strongly protects statements on matters of public interest. Garrison v. Louisiana famously laid down that “speech concerning public affairs is more than self-expression, it is the essence of self-government”. And Cox Broadcasting Corporation v. Cohn saw the majority lay down that “the freedom of the press to publish that information appears to us to be of critical importance to our type of government in which the citizenry is the final judge of the proper conduct of public business”. Commenting on the progress of Mueller’s ‘Russiagate’ investigation is clearly a matter of public interest and will likely require Mueller to establish “actual malice”, as mentioned earlier.
3. Opinions: statements of opinion are also generally treated as protected speech by the Supreme Court. In Gertz v. Robert Welch it was said that “under the First Amendment, there is no such thing as a false idea” and that “however pernicious an opinion may seem, we depend for its correction not on the conscience of judges and juries but on the competition of other ideas”. And while Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Co rejected the notion of requiring “opinion privilege” to conform to the First Amendment (which many states do recognise), the court did create two categories of opinions which were “protected” by the First Amendment, one of which includes “loose, figurative or hyperbolic language which would negate the impression that the writer was seriously maintaining” an actual fact, which certainly seems met by the statement quoted above. If that’s not enough, Mar-Jac Poultry Inc v. Katz spoke of statements that “no reasonable jury” could find “were anything but rank speculation, surmise or hyperbole” and “was presented as mere speculation”, which certainly seems like an apt description of Gingrich’s comments.
All in all, for various legal reasons if Mueller sued Gingrich in libel he’d have a pretty difficult time succeeding in his action, not to mention all the accusations of “suppressing dissent” that Mueller would inevitably receive from Fox News and Breitbart, which he would understandably wish to avoid.",0

Naturally, that runs into its own problems (like proving a “real and substantial tort” occurred in the jurisdiction, as per Jameel v. Dow Jones & Co. Inc.), but you get to avoid all the First Amendment difficulties originating in the US, and English defamation laws are pretty famously pro-claimant (although after the Defamation Act 2013 its much harder for foreigners to take advantage of that, and the SPEECH Act makes it particularly-difficult for US citizens to do so).",0

He’d have a hard time arguing a defence of “honest opinion” because it requires that an “honest and fair-minded person” be able to hold the same opinion on all available facts (clearly not the case here), and he can’t argue a “public interest” defence either because it requires the defendant to satisfy a test of “responsible journalism” under Reynolds v. Times Newspapers, which is almost-certainly laughably not satisfied here either. So Gingrich would be pretty much screwed. He should thank his lucky stars that he lives in a country where the First Amendment imposes such stringent protections for potential defendants with regards to state defamation laws.",0

The reverberations of what the actor has contributed to pop culture are unceasing. However, over the duration of his career, Will Smith made it a point to avoid movies about slavery.

A positive (false, as it turned out) COVID test on set this morning meant a new round of nasal swabs for everyone. And a series of thunderstorms has delayed today’s shoot for hours—a 30-minute pause is mandated each and every time that lightning strikes, and there have already been dozens. Will Smith covers the November 2021 issue of GQ. To get a copy, subscribe to GQ. Shirt, $1,675, by Loro Piana. Necklace, $1,680, by Bulgari. Nothing has been easy about the making of Emancipation, an Apple TV+ project that tells the story of “Whipped Peter,” the Black man whose tattered back is depicted in one of the most famous photos of an enslaved American. The movie was originally slated to shoot in Georgia, but filming was relocated in response to the state’s attempt to pass new voting restrictions. The current location, deep in the muck about an hour from New Orleans, requires a near daily battle with the terrain. By the time I showed up in mid-July, production was already behind schedule. “We’re at the mercy of Mother Nature,” director Antoine Fuqua told me. “The heat, rainstorms, lightning, mosquitoes, the swamp with alligators.” And then, of course, there is the subject matter. As I watch the filming from a few feet away, Smith stands beneath a massive railway bridge the enslaved men are being forced to construct. Smoke from the nearby campfires sticks to the skyline above, and the camera catches Smith’s character conspiring in whispers with his fellow workers about how they might find freedom, just out of earshot of their Confederate captors. “I’ve always avoided making films about slavery,” Smith had told me about an hour earlier as we sat in a production trailer. “In the early part of my career… I didn’t want to show Black people in that light. I wanted to be a superhero. So I wanted to depict Black excellence alongside my white counterparts. I wanted to play roles that you would give to Tom Cruise. And the first time I considered it was Django. But I didn’t want to make a slavery film about vengeance.”",0
1439085136381890562,I really can't emphasize enough how much I despise Will Smith #ATLvsSF,"This November, when his memoir, Will, hits bookshelves, the world will receive the most unvarnished version to date of Smith’s own story. He had wanted to write a book for a few years by the time his team reached out to Mark Manson, author of the mega best seller, The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck, while Smith was filming 2019’s Gemini Man. “An hour later, I’m on his private jet,” Manson recalled, adding that the entire experience still seems surreal: “Pieces of my brain were splattered against the wall.” The two spent a few days on the Cayman Islands, getting to know each other and brainstorming. “I’ve spent my whole career hiding my true self from the world,” Manson said Smith told him. “I want this book to show people who I really am.” Later, Smith explained to me that he “just really wanted to totally destroy the clinging to ‘Will Smith,’ trying to separate the image of Will Smith from who I actually am.” By the last day of their trip, Manson presented a rough chapter outline. “Hell yeah, hell yeah!” he said Smith exclaimed, running around the room in excitement. “This is it!” Smith’s story starts in Wynnefield, the middle-class neighborhood in West Philadelphia where his parents moved the family when he was two years old. “For a young Black family in the 1970s, this was as ‘American Dream’ as you could get,” he writes of the tightly clustered brick row houses. In the book, he discusses what he describes as one of the defining experiences of his life: at the age of nine, watching as his father punched his mother in the side of the head. It was not the only violence Smith saw his father inflict while growing up, but this particular incident, he writes, “has defined who I am today.” His brother jumped up, trying to intervene. His sister fled, hiding in her bedroom. Smith remembers freezing, too scared to do anything. Smith never discussed the violence with his father, who championed his son’s career until he died in 2016. “My father tormented me. And he was also one of the greatest men I’ve ever known,” Smith writes, noting that his father was the one who instilled in him his sense of loyalty and perfectionism. “He was one of the greatest blessings of my life, and also one of my greatest sources of pain.” For decades, Smith has seen himself as a coward. His desire to please people, to entertain the crowd, and to make us all laugh, he explains, is rooted, at least in part, in the belief that if he kept everyone—his father, his classmates, his fans—smiling, they wouldn’t lash out with violence at him or the people he loved. If he could keep making his mother proud through his accomplishments, he reasoned, perhaps she would forgive his childhood inaction. “What you have come to understand as ‘Will Smith,’ the alien annihilating M.C., the bigger-than-life movie star, is largely a construction—a carefully crafted and honed character—designed to protect myself,” he writes. Later he says, “Comedy defuses all negativity. It is impossible to be angry, hateful, or violent when you’re doubled over laughing.”",0
1439085136381890562,I really can't emphasize enough how much I despise Will Smith #ATLvsSF,"The book-writing process was difficult, in part, because Smith wanted to be cautious about the places where telling his own story intersected with telling the stories of others. When the first draft of the manuscript was finished, he convened the people who were mentioned most prominently, primarily family and longtime friends, in Miami. “I read everybody everything I was saying about them,” Smith told me. “I had to get 25 people to come to Miami and hear what I’m saying, because I know people are going to have to live with it forever.” This meeting was the first time Will had ever spoken with his mother about the times his father hit her. “It was literally the first time we ever discussed [it],” Smith told me. “She had never heard my perception of what happened. So it was really cathartic in a way. It went great. But it was a brutal couple of weeks, man. It was brutal.” The book fills in the details of Smith’s younger years: how he went from making high school raps in his friend DJ Jazzy Jeff’s basement to the duo becoming the first hip-hop artists to win a Grammy; how he blew his money on cars and girlfriends before borrowing a few grand from a local drug dealer to pay for his move to L.A., where he ended up auditioning for the starring role in The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air at a party at Quincy Jones’s house; how he lashed out at his first love after she had an affair; how his first marriage, to Sheree Zampino, ended under the weight of his growing ambition, with divorce papers delivered on Valentine’s Day; and how his jealousy of Tupac Shakur, a close childhood friend of his second wife, Jada, prevented him from ever speaking to the legendary rapper before his death. “I totally opened myself up to a fresh sampling of the fruits of the human experience.” Manson said he told Smith that “one of the conditions for this to work for me was that everything needs to be on the table. We can’t have a P.R. person coming in and saying, ‘No, that chapter needs to go.’ ” Smith was more than game, Manson recalled: “Throughout the process there are certain things that came up, and he was like, ‘Why not, let’s put it in.’ I was worried that a lot of stuff was going to get axed. He actually surprised me. ‘Yeah, that’s a little ugly. Let’s keep it in there.’ ” Most clearly, though, the book provides a detailed accounting of Smith’s deliberate effort to become the biggest movie star in the world. “I wanted to do what Eddie Murphy was doing. I wanted to make people feel how I felt the first time I saw Star Wars,” Smith writes. “I wanted to be Eddie Murphy in Star Wars.” The pursuit began with one of his first roles, in 1993’s Six Degrees of Separation. For a rapper turned actor, it was a bold project—a cerebral play made into a film, based on a true story, in which Smith’s young, gay con artist fools a series of high-society New Yorkers into providing him shelter by convincing them he’s the son of Sidney Poitier.",0
1439085136381890562,I really can't emphasize enough how much I despise Will Smith #ATLvsSF,"He started studying Liza Koshy, who’d leveraged her success on Vine and YouTube into acting roles, and who advised Smith to stop trying to be so perfect. Social media thrives on the perception of authenticity. It was fine if he flubbed a line or his lighting wasn’t perfect in a TikTok. Smith started shooting some of his videos on his iPhone, as opposed to professional camera equipment. He took cues from Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart, who impressed him with the way they’d share behind-the-scenes moments from their movie shoots—something that would have been unthinkable in the Hollywood that Smith had come up in. “They were doing unheard of stuff, posting pictures from set. You can’t post pictures from set a year before the movie comes out—Oh, shit, yes you can,” Smith recalled thinking. “I just saw how they invited people into the process in a way that I thought you weren’t allowed to do.” Bright, the 2017 film Smith starred in for Netflix, was the first to use his content studio, Westbrook Media, to produce social media from the set. After a career of getting excited about scripts that the public might not see on the big screen for years—I Am Legend, for example, took over 10 years to get made—there was something intoxicating about shooting, editing, and getting a video clip out to the public in just a matter of hours. “It completely changed how I interacted with the world and how I interacted with my creative life. I wanted to create fast and put it out.” Sometimes he runs his ideas for posts by his children. Other times, when he’s traveling, the Westbrook Media team reaches out to local social media influencers to set up Creator Days, in which he meets up with a bunch of them to make content. “To just be able to make things, without an outcome goal that had to do with being the biggest movie star in the world, back to the feeling in [DJ Jazzy] Jeff’s mom’s basement of making music. It was fun. We were experimenting, we were trying things. That’s what’s happened again for me with social media,” Smith told me. “It’s such a powerful way for me to keep in touch with people and, creatively, what the next thing is about to be. The next phase of my life is going to be the most creative and expansive of my entire life and career.” Smith’s foray into social media also comes at a time when he and Jada have become Hollywood’s most transparent and vulnerable couple. Red Table Talk, the Facebook show hosted by Pinkett Smith, is the closest thing the digital age has to the role Oprah Winfrey and Dr. Phil once played on broadcast television—a place for difficult, messy conversations about love, sex, drugs, and everything else, often featuring their daughter, Willow, and Jada’s mother, Adrienne Banfield-Norris. Smith himself has appeared on the show, most notably for a frank discussion with Jada about a period of non-monogamy in their marriage. “The pursuit of truth is the only way to be happy in this lifetime,” Smith told me. “And we sort of came to the agreement that authenticity was the release from the shackles of fame and public scrutiny.” When you tell the truth, the pair reasoned, you never have to fear being found out.",0
1439085136381890562,I really can't emphasize enough how much I despise Will Smith #ATLvsSF,"Throughout the draft that I’d read, Smith had dropped in foreshadowing tidbits about marital acrimony. Jada, her husband writes, hadn’t wanted a traditional wedding ceremony but gave in to his pressure: “This would be the first of many compromises Jada would make over the years that painfully negated her own values.” Years later, Smith persuaded her to move into a massive 256-acre compound that she was dead set against purchasing. “Nothing good comes from spending your hard-earned money on a ‘family home’ that your wife doesn’t want,” Smith writes. “You are putting a down payment on discord and for years you will be paying off a mortgage of misery. Or, worse.” The harsh reality for those who love a dreamer is that everything comes second to the dream. As Smith’s stardom grew, his wife would wake up many mornings in tears. At one point, she turned down an opportunity for her band to open for Guns N’ Roses so that Smith could continue shooting The Pursuit of Happyness. Things reached a breaking point by Jada’s 40th birthday, in 2011. Will had spent three years planning a private family-and-friends dinner in Santa Fe, where he screened a documentary he’d commissioned that chronicled her life and traced her family’s lineage back to slavery (and in which he tracked down a descendant of the white family who once owned Jada’s ancestors.) When they got back to the hotel suite that night, Jada was nearly silent. “That was the most disgusting display of ego I have ever seen in my life,” Smith recalls his wife telling him. The two began fighting so loudly that a 10-year-old Willow, with whom they were sharing the suite, emerged crying with her hands over her ears, begging them to stop. “Our marriage wasn’t working,” Smith writes. “We could no longer pretend. We were both miserable and clearly something had to change.” And then, a little abruptly, the book’s narrative about Will and Jada ends. In the early version of the manuscript that I read, there was no discussion of any outside relationships, on his behalf or hers. When I mentioned this to Smith, he asked me: “You felt cheated?” Now, look, I’m a reporter. I certainly read that manuscript ready to jot down any and every detail about who and what Will and Jada may have been doing during the more open parts of their past decade. But the reality is, a fair amount of what’s missing played out in public. At some point, their relationship stopped being monogamous. “Jada never believed in conventional marriage.… Jada had family members that had an unconventional relationship. So she grew up in a way that was very different than how I grew up. There were significant endless discussions about, what is relational perfection? What is the perfect way to interact as a couple? And for the large part of our relationship, monogamy was what we chose, not thinking of monogamy as the only relational perfection,” Smith told me. “We have given each other trust and freedom, with the belief that everybody has to find their own way. And marriage for us can’t be a prison. And I don’t suggest our road for anybody. I don’t suggest this road for anybody. But the experiences that the freedoms that we’ve given one another and the unconditional support, to me, is the highest definition of love.”",0

But without a salary, Chris and his son are evicted from their apartment and are forced to sleep on the streets, in homeless shelters and even behind the locked doors of a metro station bathroom. With self-confidence and the love and trust of his son, Chris Gardner rises above his obstacles to become a Wall Street legend.",0

1439085136381890562,I really can't emphasize enough how much I despise Will Smith #ATLvsSF,"Action Comedy: his role as Det. Mike Lowrey on the Bad Boys films. Having a complementary co star like Martin Lawrence, this buddy cop film series is one of the best next to Beverly Hills Cop, 48 Hrs., Lethal Weapon, and Rush Hour. I just hate Bad Boys 3 being titled Bad Boys for Life in which they could have potentially called a fourth and final installment “Bad Boys 4 Life” but you know, win some lose some.",0
1439085136381890562,I really can't emphasize enough how much I despise Will Smith #ATLvsSF,"Sci-Fi Comedy: his role as Agent J in the Men In Black films. Another buddy cop film that I love. Granted they're fighting off an alien attack against Earth (Will's second film to do so since Independence Day), but they're doing it in a comical and fun driven way. The two nominated before Will for the role of Agent J couldn't have pulled off the comical role. Saddening that the 4th installment will have neither Tommy Lee Jones nor Will Smith.",0
1439085136381890562,I really can't emphasize enough how much I despise Will Smith #ATLvsSF,Western Comedy: his role as Capt. James T. West in Wild Wild West.

1439085136381890562,I really can't emphasize enough how much I despise Will Smith #ATLvsSF,"Urban Fantasy Crime: his role as Daryl Ward in Bright. It could have been executed better but with Will being thrown into something that has orcs, faeries, wands and elves, it's better here than on Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter or Chronicles of Narnia or any other fantasy film. Take a writer from a successful film like Training Day, writing a buddy cop film and mash it with fantasy and the product is this. High expectations but low execution.",0

I don't understand all this hostility towards him. I get that he hasn't been on the hotstreak but he's at the point in his career where he can do anything he likes, and I enjoy him in his blockbusters. Personally, I wish he would do more dramas and more serious character pieces because he is a pretty seasoned actor and I'm sure he has to chops to elevate it. I would love to see him devote his talents to a better director like Christopher Nolan.",1
1439082663432769539,The pitcher Will Smith is scum!,"Back in the 1990s, Will Smith was able to solidify his A-lister status in Hollywood - leaving his Fresh Prince of Bel-Air days behind him - thanks to the one-two punch of Independence Day in 1996 (which grossed $817 million worldwide), followed by another sci-fi hit with Men in Black ($589 million global take) a year later. Smith has since protected Earth from the scum of the universe in two additional Men in Black movies, but despite frequent discussions over the years, an ID4 sequel has never come to fruition.",0
1439082663432769539,The pitcher Will Smith is scum!,"Writer/director Roland Emmerich is working to change that, as he's been actively developing a followup to his famous monument-leveling alien invasion adventure for at least the past year. He and his ID4 co-writer Dean Devlin have put together two different script drafts for the project (semi-officially known as Independence Day 2, but previously referred to as ID Forever) - one with Smith as Steven Hiller returning and one without him. But which script (both of which have since been revised by White House Down writer James Vanderbilt) is Emmerich likely to end up using?",0
1439082663432769539,The pitcher Will Smith is scum!,"According to Deadline, the latter is the best guess at this stage, as Smith has ""pretty much decided"" not to return for the Independence Day sequel. Deadline's Mike Fleming Jr. cautions that Smith hasn't closed this door completely just yet, and the fact that the actor went back and forth on this issue throughout 2013 - first he was definitely out, then he was possibly in - means there may well still be flex room here. Still, the recent progress on planned Smith vehicles like the sci-fi thriller Selling Time and the fantasy drama City That Sailed seems to signal the actor's interest in pursuing original fare and sticking with his commitment to not becoming ""the sequel guy.""",0
1439082663432769539,The pitcher Will Smith is scum!,"Emmerich has indicated before that the Independence Day sequel will feature several new characters, so it's possible that part of Smith's disinterest is due to his character not getting much time in the spotlight - he passed on starring in Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained for similar reasons (i.e. because Django wasn't really the lead). To be fair, though, it might also be because Smith feels it's time to let someone else take the helm and guide the Independence Day property (which was always more of an ensemble adventure, anyway) onward from here.",0
1439082663432769539,The pitcher Will Smith is scum!,"He's suggested before that it's for similar reasons that he's doubtful about coming back for a fourth Men in Black film, and the latest report from Deadline affirms that Smith is unlikely to reprise as Agent J in the future. Sony has recruited screenwriter Oren Uziel (co-writer on the upcoming 22 Jump Street) to put together a Men in Black 4 script, with the intention of rebooting the franchise. That's partly because having to pay Smith and costar Tommy Lee Jones' high-salaries has made profiting on the MIB films increasingly difficult (Sony rebooted Spider-Man for similar reasons), but also because Men in Black 3's quality indicated that... well... maybe it was time for some new blood, to keep that cash cow alive and well.",0

1439082663432769539,The pitcher Will Smith is scum!,"There are exceptions, of course, but there's a real tendency for actors to be nice, and, in general, the industry selects for nice people? Why? Because actors have to work together intimately for long, intense periods. They have to collaborate on complicated projects. a single asshole can spoil things for everyone, make the film, show, or play a nightmare to work on, and hurt the production. Collaboration will fail, because everyone will just want to get it over with as soon as possible. People will do what they can to protect themselves from the asshole, rather than being open and vulnerable, which is what you want actors to be.",0
1439082663432769539,The pitcher Will Smith is scum!,"If someone keeps getting cast despite the fact that he's an asshole, there must be something really extraordinary about him. He must be so talented or such a box-office draw, people are willing to work with him despite how much pain he causes. It happens, but it's incredibly rare. By most reports, the big-name stars you hear about—Tom Cruise and so on—are all fun to work with and generous to their coworkers. (Sometimes bad actors get cast over and over because they're ""good enough"" and everyone on the set loves them.)",0

1439082663432769539,The pitcher Will Smith is scum!,"Here's a lesson I've learned, and, from what I hear, it applies throughout the industry: if you have to choose between casting two equally talented or famous actors, choose the nicer one; if you have to choose between a brilliant asshole and a slightly-less-talented nice person, choose the latter. In theory, your film will suffer a little, but will it really? Maybe that brilliant asshole would have given a better performance in his part, but he also might have put a dent in everyone else's performance.",0

1439082663432769539,The pitcher Will Smith is scum!,"Most people try to follow these rules in their careers. I've seen companies forgo hiring brilliant, anti-social programmers and opt for talented (but less brilliant) nice programmers. These employers are, smartly, thinking about the effect one bad seed can have on a team. It's worth remembering that while to us movies are these magical stories, to the people who make them, they're work. They go do a work place and do a job. And, like most of us, they want to make their jobs as pleasant as possible.",0
1439082663432769539,The pitcher Will Smith is scum!,"I have had a number of interactions with famous people, and I would say this - some are, some are not. I think the charisma most likely comes from being quite good at something, and you can find that in other careers as well.",0

Many celebrities do NOT claim to be role models or to be perfect. Of course that the work of celebrities such as music, movies, t.v shows etc… CAN lift you up when you are down and sometimes touch on something that you though no one else in the world but you could ever understand and it makes you feel less alone.

After his father was killed four years ago in an airstrike on the mosque where he was praying, Muhammad and his brother would wait for the daily bombing to stop, film the carnage from their roof and document the suffering of survivors. He and his family soon became government targets, and fled to Turkey from where he spoke to us. It wasn’t just his bravery that was notable; it was the warmth of his smile, his zest for life, despite all he has seen. Since we last spoke, Jolie has Zoomed again with Muhammad and a girl who is campaigning against period poverty. “His relationship to that teenage girl and her activism was more in tune than almost any man I’ve met,” Jolie says.

Mistyana said she thinks Angelina Jolie is ugly… ive been mad since.,"Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt were Hollywood’s golden couple; so famous that they had a portmanteau moniker, Brangelina. And Brangelina was, aptly, the ultimate celebrity brand. Both are Oscar winners, among the highest paid stars in the film business (Pitt is said to be worth $300m, Jolie $150m), mainstream draws and indie icons, and of course utterly gorgeous (Pitt was twice voted the sexiest man alive by People magazine, while Jolie was named sexiest woman alive by Esquire magazine in 2004). But Brangelina also became a byword for celebrity altrusim and consciousness-raising. Pitt accompanied Jolie on many of her UNHCR trips, they opened schools in war-torn countries, and three of their six children were adopted from countries brutalised by conflict and poverty – 20-year-old Maddox is Cambodian, 17-year-old Pax is Vietnamese and 16-year-old Zahara is Ethiopian. They even managed to manipulate the media to their own ends. Faced with the inevitability of being papped when their daughter Shiloh was born in 2006, Jolie and Pitt auctioned off the photoshoot to People magazine in the US and Hello! in Britain for $7.6m. Two years later, when twins Knox and Vivienne arrived, they sold the shoot to the same magazines for an estimated $14m, making them the most expensive celebrity photos in history. On both occasions, the proceeds went to the Jolie-Pitt Foundation to fund humanitarian projects. As a couple, they seemed too good (or at least too successful) to be true.",0

In September 2016, Jolie filed for divorce from Pitt, which was finalised in 2019. But they are still locked in a bitter custody battle, after she alleged domestic violence against him. In November 2016, the FBI announced no charges would be brought against Pitt, and cleared him of any wrongdoing, following an incident a couple of months earlier on their private plane in which it was alleged that a drunk Pitt was abusive with Maddox, then 15. Five days after the incident, Jolie filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences and stating that her decision to end the marriage “was made for the health of the family”. Pitt admitted he had an alcohol problem (he attended Alcoholics Anonymous after their separation) and that he had yelled at one of his children, but has always denied being physically abusive to them.

Certainly part of it is that Madonna isn't -- and hasn't really been since ""Erotica"" (1992) -- in her prime. It also may simply be that Madonna, at 41, is now a mother twice over, and was in the last stages of pregnancy during what would have normally been full-steam-ahead press time. She tried: In the Rolling Stone article, she is so determined that she meets writer Jancee Dunn at the offices of her Maverick record company even though she ""feels like a whale."" When asked one rather innocuous question, she nearly begins to cry in response, a clear result of hormones gone haywire. But it also seems that this record is being mistakenly overlooked musically.

If ""Ray of Light"" was explicitly about spirituality, then the new record is just spiritual. Because on ""Music,"" for the first time, Madonna really lets go: Her voice flies, electronically filtered, flitting all around, chasing itself. She also lets go by allowing Mirwais to once again reinvent what a Madonna record sounds like. (There's a great story about her meeting the producer for the first time in Paris and just staring at him: She didn't, in a very uncharacteristic moment, know what she wanted from him.) Perhaps even the record's unassuming quality is a letting go; she's stopped trying to do something so important this time around. Although musically the new record acknowledges her earliest stuff (1983's ""Madonna,"" 1984's ""Like a Virgin""), ""Music"" has a mature, full-circle perspective. To me, it's as though with William Orbit, her producer on ""Ray of Light,"" Madonna just got revved up, and with Mirwais, she takes off.",0

It used to be that art fancied itself separate from the vulgar mechanics of money and merchandising. Andy Warhol did an enormous amount to change that idea in highbrow circles, but Madonna made it conventional wisdom to conflate art and commerce. These days, no one asks why someone like, say, Puff Daddy, who's mediocre at best musically, should be a huge pop star, since in a way his self-promotion is his art. Meanwhile, musicians who are seen as insufficiently calculating are routinely trashed.

She did the whole S/M and profane Catholic thing with ""Erotica"" and the ""Sex"" book a few years after the controversy over Robert Mapplethorpe and Andres Serrano made bondage and blasphemy front-page issues. She recorded ""Ray of Light"" just as electronica was becoming ubiquitous. These days, though, there are so many people like, um, me, who publicly chew over the tiniest implication of every pop moment that there's less fresh grist for her mill.

The track ""Impressive Instant,"" with its dirty, sexy, French house beat and tripped-out vocal production, is fabulous. Still, it feels slightly behind the curve. The vocoder effects on her voice aren't just familiar from underground acts like Basement Jaxx and Daft Punk -- they recall Cher's ""Believe.""

The song (DD) is 100% about Diana Ross! She was the Love of his life, and after she promised to marry him, he thought his dream was finally coming true. She agreed to marry him in the mid 80s, and accepted his ring. You see it on her finger at the Motown 25th show and the AMA of 84. In fact, at the AMA is the first time she kissed him (in the mouth-in public!) She was also holding his face in her hands so people could see the ring. She was testing the waters to see how the public would react -Diana has always done that.They then allegedly told his mother together. Katherine Jackson threw a fit. She told Diana she was too old for her son, and that she was soiling him. She called the papers, and told reporters. Reporters began following and harassing Diana. They kept making age cracks and calling her a cradle robber and the like. Diana could not take the pressure, she ran off with Arne Naess instead, and left MJ devastated! He was so angry and upset, he wrote a ton of love and heartbreak songs about her.",0

After he stopped crying, he got angry. He had spent millions buying her whatever she wanted. He had spent years trying to marry her. He wrote Dirty Diana and it was mean spirited, and designed to make her look like a slut! It was originally much worse. But MJ wrote it as a revenge song to her for breaking his heart. That's why he said 'She likes the boys in the band""..Diana loved musicians and dated Lionel Richie of commodores, Barry Gibb of the Bee gees and Gene Simmons of Kiss WHILE when she was supposed to be with Michael! She also caused a life long feud between he and Gene when she slept with Gene and called out MJ’s name! Gene blamed MJ and they were enemies for life. This is also why he said she would say JUST MAKE ME A STAR!!! MJ felt that she just wanted fame and money even over the man who desperately loved her (HIM) {The part about her saying he's not coming home because he's sleeping with me! is him describing her behavior every time he would try valiantly to get her out of his system, and try to be with someone else.} She would mysteriously show up, get jealous, and try to wrap herself around him.(instantly, he would be drawn back in). Go watch Di when MJ had the publicity date with Madonna, she went and sat in his lap, and hogged all his attention. Go watch her when Liz Taylor came on stage to give him moral support after Diana married and he was obviously very upset. Diana was on stage flirting with Lionel Richie, and the moment Liz came and tried to hold MJ's hand, Diana rushed over and grabbed his arm, she also moved in between them during the song and tried to push Liz away! When Brooke was his date for the AMAs she did the same. She was on stage, so she flirted from the stage with him, and blew kisses! When he came up to get his award, she latched on and flirted so hard, she forgot her lines! That's what he was talking about, her refusing to commit, but coming in to ruin every relationship he had with other women, even platonic ones. He wrote the song and made her sound like a whore. The 2nd verse really went in hard at her, and all but called her a whore. When Quincy Jones heard the song he flipped out! He said everyone would know it was about her, and begged MJ not to do that to her. He told him to tone it way down, and change the 2nd verse so it sounded like a groupie. Then to just tell everyone it was about groupies when they asked. That's what they did, but Diana knew it was about her, and she was so angry she didn't speak to Michael for weeks. When Diana forgave him, and started speaking to him again, she joked about him making that song about her, and even recorded her OWN version of it, and used it as an intro to her show!! This song is about Diana Ross and his feelings of being seduced and still attracted to her, despite them breaking up and her marrying another man. The 1st and 3rd verses reflect this. The 2nd verse was added about the groupie at the suggestion of Quincy Jones. He advised Michael the song title and the lyrics are too personal and he ran the risk of their secret affair getting exposed. Not to mention Michael would have to explain the meaning of the lyrics when asked about the song. So to have an explanation of the lyrics the 2nd verse was added so that he could simply say the song was about groupie. The truth is in his lyrics and the first and last verse are too personal to be talking about one night stand relations with a stranger. Michael also liked to use double entendres in his songs. He was still angry at Diana for hurting him and he wanted to use this song to hurt her. Look up what the word groupie meant in Motown language and you will understand why Ross was indeed hurt by this and decided to use this intro on one of her albums to show the message was received.",0

That same scene was replicated in the video, when he had the crowd holding up 1000s of candles to his beloved ""Diana' at the end!! Diana is the ONLY woman he ever had this type of candle-ceremony for!

(b) May 20, 2004: U.S. troops, along with Iraqi forces, storm Chalabi’s home, seizing documents and computers for a criminal probe. (c) June 2004: The New York Times reports that Chalabi has disclosed U.S. secrets to Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. (3) When an employee of the Coalition Provisional Authority named Thomas Warrick voiced concerns about Chalabi to his superiors, the vice president intervened to demand that Warrick be fired, causing Warrick’s unique contributions to the occupation—including a series of prescient written warnings about the rise of insurgency—to be lost, and the nation’s ability to function at war compromised.

Cheney’s files from his days as Gerald Ford’s chief of staff in the post-Watergate/Vietnam moment show the origins of this agenda. Day upon day, the Ford White House was confronting the Church Committee’s investigations of intelligence abuses and a Congress that was determined to re-impose checks and balances on the “imperial” presidency. This seemed outrageous from Cheney’s vantage point and he spent the next three decades trying, without much success at first, to roll back the changes of the 1970s and to restore presidential power to the level it had briefly, aberrationally, reached before Nixon fell. During his decade in the House of Representatives, he continuously argued with his colleagues that they ought to be giving the president more flexibility, not less, especially in matters of national security and foreign affairs—not just during Iran-Contra, but throughout that decade. As Secretary of Defense to the first President Bush, he urged George H.W. Bush to launch the Gulf War without going to Congress for permission, like Truman had done, though his advice was rejected. But the second President Bush adopted Cheney’s view that they ought to use their time in office to strengthen presidential power as an end to itself—to leave the office stronger than it had been when they inherited it—and that is what they set out to do. On a day-to-day level in the White House bureaucracy, Cheney’s top aide David Addington has been the most important bureaucratic force driving this policy.",0

It ends with Nixon literally haunting the shadows of the White House, alone.

As a Vice President he had always taken care to yield to Bush in any public forum. After 9/11 Cheney's location was famously kept secret to avoid giving anyone a chance to assassinate both the President and the Vice President. So Cheney made few public appearances, and really had little interest in defending himself.

Maybe this is especially true for Presidents who had a reputation as delegating a lot -- Reagan, Bush II, Eisenhower. It might also be truer for Republicans than Democrats. Kissinger got a lot of blame for Vietnam despite the fact that Nixon was clearly the decision-maker. On the other hand, people seem to clearly hold LBJ and Obama responsible for their decisions.",0

Haliburton had a large amount of oil-business which led people to be a little wary when Cheney established a secret ""Energy Task Force"", formally known as the National Energy Policy Development Group (NEPDG), for the purpose of making recommendations to President Bush on energy policy. The task force met mainly in private with several oil companies and was said to have facilitated the wholesale writing of the Energy policy by corporate lobbyists.

It is known that Cheney was the driving force behind a number of things that happened during the Bush presidency and perhaps even more than has been proven.

The fact that Cheney’s former employer Halliburton did so well as a result of the Iraq invasion only seemed to prove that point.,0

The most important is that Bush came across as a really likable guy (and I think he probably is). He seemed to be the kind of guy you would like to have a beer with (if he still drank). Cheney seemed like more like an ideologue who was used to getting his own way -- a bully type or at least lots of sharp edges. The second reason is that Cheney came across as far more conservative and in ways that many Americans didn't like. Bush never really had much of an agenda other than protecting oil and the interests of his friends and supporters and came across as much less doctrinaire.

Bush, he failed to come forward and excise the cancer of Trump from the body politic - If Cheney were more public now, especially with media sources that weren’t friendly, he would have to answer a number of question as why he said little in 2016 and even less following 2020 election and the January 6, 2021 insurrection.
2. Cheney’s health - Basically Cheney shoudl be dead. After decades of heart issues, a transplant, and years alcoholism, Dick Cheney should have shed this mortal coil years ago. He’s even outlasted his former rivals of Colin Powell and Donald Rumsfeld. Cheney’s health has always been precarious and it’s likely that 80 years of age, he doesn’t have the energy for an extended media campaign.
3. COVID-19 - It would unwise for a man with Cheney’s health issues to be appearing in public or exposing himself to too many outsiders. It’s likely that Cheney stays close to home and is only exposed to people who have been tested and vaccinated and who are “known quantities”.
4. Guantanamo, Iraq and The War on Terror - Basically Cheney was the architect of a litany of failures and it’s not likely that he cares to explain, nor justify, a record that hasn’t gotten better even when compared to the disastrous Trump Administration. Again, if he was interviewed by anything other than friendly media sources, the questioning would be difficult and even unpleasant, and Cheney seems to have no interest in going through that.
5. His various attacks on the Obama Administration - Basically Cheney was used as an attack dog by the GOP against the Obama presidency both to cover for the crimes and incompetence of his own administration as well as to set the table for a potential GOP victory in 2016. The GOP did win in 2016, although it wasn’t how or what Che,ney wanted to happen. It gets worse because despite his attacks, it’s clear that the Obama Administration was superior in every way than both his own and Donald Trump’s. Cheney certainly doesn’t want to answer tough questions about that.

Secure your own copy here. Jumpsuit, $4,200, by Dior Men. Ring, his own. He has lived a well-documented life—maybe among the more well-documented lives in the history of this decaying planet. But to my knowledge, there is not one example of him speaking this way—in a moving but unprompted, unselfconscious torrent of words—in public prior to this moment. I will admit to being disoriented. If I’m being honest, I had been expecting someone else entirely—someone more monosyllabic; someone more distracted, more unhappy; someone more like the guy I’m pretty sure Justin Bieber was not all that long ago—and now I am so thrown that the best I can do is stammer out some tortured version of… How did you become this person? By which I mean: seemingly guileless. Bursting with the desire to connect, to tell his own story, in case it might be of use to anyone else. It’s a question that’s not even a question, really. But what Bieber gently says in response is: “That’s okay.” He knows approximately what I’m asking—how he got from wherever he was to here, to becoming the man in front of me, clear-eyed on a computer screen from an undisclosed location in Los Angeles. His hair, under a Vetements hat, is long in the back; he is in no particular hurry. He is married to a woman—Hailey Baldwin Bieber—who cares for him like no one has ever cared for him, he says. He is happy. He is currently renovating the house in which he will live happily with his wife. He’s spent the past several months piecing together a new record, Justice, which is dense with love songs and ’80s-style anthems—interspersed with some well-intentioned, if not totally well-advised, interludes featuring the voice of Martin Luther King Jr.—that are bluntly honest about his bad past and equally optimistic about his future. (“Everybody saw me sick, and it felt like no one gave a shit,” he sings on the cathartic last song on the record, “Lonely.”) He’s still so overflowing with music that he puts out Freedom, a meditative, postscript of an EP about faith, just a few weeks after Justice. He is, if anything, the empathetic professional in this interaction too as he goes about trying to help me understand how he’s arrived at where he’s arrived.",0

Doja catttt ate this year... giving this award to Justin Bieber is dumb as fuck,"He is aware that people have perceived him at times as anything but full of love. But today, he says, he thinks of himself as a comforter, in part because he knows what it is to have been the person who needed comfort so badly. He asks himself now: How can I be of service? The new music, the inspirational messages he posts on Instagram, the deliberately calm manner in which he goes about his days—all of it is addressed in some ways to his younger self, to the kid who was drowning and felt like he’d never be saved. Justin Bieber wants to save that kid now. He wants to talk to him. He wants to tell him not all is lost. Jeans, $198, by Levi’s Authorized Vintage. His own underwear by Calvin Klein Underwear. Sneakers, $120, by Nike x Sacai. Socks, $14, by American Trench. “I don’t want to let my shame of my past dictate what I’m able to do now for people,” Bieber says. “A lot of people let their past weigh them down, and they never do what they want to do because they think that they’re not good enough. But I’m just like: ‘I did a bunch of stupid shit. That’s okay. I’m still available. I’m still available to help. And I’m still worthy of helping.’ ” To gain access to him during a pandemic, one must first get through his private medical team. A nurse is on call at the house and at the studio. Collaborators, friends, managers, producers, songwriters, engineers, all the disparate people one needs to gather together to again commence the work of being Justin Bieber—all are administered one rapid test and one PCR. “There’s so many different tests,” Bieber says. “They get kinda weird, but it’s important for us, since we’re operating on such a big level, with so many people, that we keep everyone safe.” Bieber and Hailey spent the first three or four months of the pandemic in Canada, where he was born, and then they came back to Los Angeles and they’ve been here ever since. He is 27, and this interlude at home represents probably the longest time he’s spent in one place since his childhood. “I’ve been moving since I was like 15 or 16,” he says.",0
1437228523857514497,This must be some ante black bullshit. Doja catttt ate this year... giving this award to Justin Bieber is dumb as fuck,"And we as a society are all too familiar with what happens next to kids like Justin Bieber. We are particularly familiar with what happened to Bieber himself—the litany of distasteful and sometimes dangerous stuff he did that he won’t defend, the equally unkind things people said about him as he did that stuff, etc. But I will share a personal view: Being famous breaks something in your brain. Especially when your fame comes as a result of your talent, from the thing you’ve loved and nurtured and worked at since you were young. Bieber earned his success while he was still a child; then his gift turned into a snake and bit him. How do you become a good or well-adjusted or normal person when you don’t have access to a single normal thing in your entire life? You can’t. You don’t. “You wake up one day and…you’re unhappy and you have all this success in the world, but you’re just like: Well, what is this worth if I’m still feeling empty inside?” And while maybe you don’t care if Justin Bieber ever does make his way back to a kind of normalcy, perhaps you can admit there is at least something admirable, in the abstract, about someone finding a way to survive, and even to become kind, when all they’ve been taught since a young age, by millions of adoring people, is that there is no need for them to be kind at all. And if that doesn’t move you, then maybe you can at least find sociological interest in the process that Bieber is about to recount here, which is how you turn into someone you don’t want to be, and what you do about it once you decide you want to be someone else. Someone better, even. Sorry about the aside. Anyway… If you ask Bieber what he would’ve been doing five years ago, should the world have shut down and locked him in his home, he will say that five years ago things were pretty dark in general. “I was surrounded by a lot of people, and we were all kind of just escaping our real life,” Bieber says. “I think we just weren’t living in reality.” Which is to say: “I think it would have probably resulted in just a lot of doing drugs and being posted up, to be honest.” Cardigan and pants (prices upon request) by Louis Vuitton Men’s.

1437228523857514497,This must be some ante black bullshit. Doja catttt ate this year... giving this award to Justin Bieber is dumb as fuck,"Josh Gudwin, Bieber’s engineer and sometime producer, says: “When you’re younger in your career, you don’t understand how things work. The people around you understand how things work, so they’re the ones putting things together.” And though Bieber is now sure enough about what he wants that he finished most of the vocals for Justice in less than 45 minutes per song, Gudwin says, things were different when he was younger. Ryan Good, one of Bieber’s oldest friends, remembers Bieber struggling. “He was disappointed with himself,” Good says. “Most people would numb themselves to that. And I think he probably went through that stage, like, ‘I’m so disappointed in myself, I don’t want to feel like this anymore. I don’t want to feel disappointed in myself anymore.’ And at a certain point, I think he got to the point where he was like, ‘No, I want to live my life and not be numb. And so I’m going to work on it. I’m going to be who I know I am.’ ” What had all of it been for? Singing, Bieber says, “was supposed to bring such joy. Like, this is what I feel called to do. And my purpose in my life. I know that when I open my mouth, people love to hear me sing. I literally started singing on the streets and crowds would form around me to where I’m like, Okay, this could be something. There’s this reciprocation of: I’m using my gifts to serve people. That’s what I loved so much. And I just think more and more as you’re a kid and you don’t have an identity yet, and you’re trying to figure out who you are, and to have everyone saying how good you are, how incredible you are? You just start to believe that stuff. And ego sets in. And then that’s where insecurities come in. And then you start treating people a certain way and feeling superior and above people. And then there’s this whole dynamic shift. I just woke up one day and I’m just like, Who am I? I didn’t know. And that was scary to me.”",0
1437228523857514497,This must be some ante black bullshit. Doja catttt ate this year... giving this award to Justin Bieber is dumb as fuck,"He spent the first year as a husband “on eggshells,” he says, but at some point he started to actually believe. Now, with his marriage to Hailey, he says, “we’re just creating these moments for us as a couple, as a family, that we’re building these memories. And it’s beautiful that we have that to look forward to. Before, I didn’t have that to look forward to in my life. My home life was unstable. Like, my home life was not existing. I didn’t have a significant other. I didn’t have someone to love. I didn’t have someone to pour into. But now I have that.” And then there is God. If you ask Chance the Rapper why he and his friend seem so happy in an industry that tends to grind people to dust, he will answer without hesitation. “Both of us, our secret sauce is Jesus,” Chance says. “Justin doesn’t fake the funk. He goes to Jesus with his problems, he goes to Jesus with his successes. He calls me just to talk about Jesus.” “Justin is blessed. There are people that are blessed that don’t have anything, but you can feel it off them. It’s like an aura, to be touched by God.” It is beautiful to hear Justin Bieber talk about God. “He is grace,” he says. “Every time we mess up, He’s picking us back up every single time. That’s how I view it. And so it’s like, ‘I made a mistake. I won’t dwell in it. I don’t sit in shame. But it actually makes me want to do better.’ ” (And perhaps this is convenient: Bieber has done a lot in his life that needs forgiving, and an ethos of total acceptance can be alarmingly close to an ethos of total impunity, of being right in your deeds, no matter how bad or dark or selfish they are. But hear him out.) I am not a believer myself. Bieber doesn’t care about this. “My goal isn’t to try and persuade anybody to believe in what I believe or condemn anybody for not believing what I believe,” he says. “If it can help someone, great. If someone’s like, ‘Hey, I don’t believe that. I don’t think that’s true,’ by all means, that’s their prerogative.” Bieber has been around different churches—he is a former attendee of Hillsong, the church once closely associated with the now disgraced pastor Carl Lentz, who was fired for “moral failures” last year. Bieber doesn’t mention Lentz by name, or even indirectly, but he says he has seen firsthand how faith, in its various institutional forms, can morph into just another kind of celebrity worship. “I think so many pastors put themselves on this pedestal,” he says. “And it’s basically, church can be surrounded around the man, the pastor, the guy, and it’s like, ‘This guy has this ultimate relationship with God that we all want but we can’t get because we’re not this guy.’ That’s not the reality, though. The reality is, every human being has the same access to God.”",0
1437228523857514497,This must be some ante black bullshit. Doja catttt ate this year... giving this award to Justin Bieber is dumb as fuck,"“A lot of people will never do what they want to do, because they’re afraid and they have shame,” he starts. “They don’t feel enough to accomplish what’s in their heart, or there’s a cause they’ve always wanted to help, but they’re just like, ‘Aw, man, like, who am I? Who am I to be able to do this? Because look what I’ve done. Look at my past.’ And that was me for a long time. And I always felt like I was a good encourager. I always felt like I could encourage people and that my words held weight. But when you start living in shame, you start to devalue what shouldn’t have lost that value. And that’s why…” He puts his head down and is silent. For 20, 30 long seconds, he says nothing. I can’t even see his face. And then he picks his head up and continues, and his voice is thick and choked. “It’s just rewarding to be all that you were designed to be. And I believe that, at this point in my life, I’m right where I’m supposed to be, doing what I believe that God wants me to do. And there’s nothing more fulfilling.” Can I ask what you were thinking about just now, in that pause? “Yeah. Uh. I just got, I just got kind of emotional because, you know, even this interview, it’s like: It matters. You had this desire in your heart to do what you’re doing, and you’re doing it. And now I am sharing what I believe God put in my heart and you are asking the questions in your brain, getting this out of me, and it’s beautiful. You’re like me. We’re all miracles, really.” His voice is as quiet as it’s been the entire time we’ve spoken. But, as he does these days, he keeps going. “You know, the fact that you are here and you made it through all the stuff that you’ve been through, you know—just because you weren’t in my position, I mean, I don’t know your story. I don’t know where you come from. I don’t know your history. I don’t know what you’ve been through. But I know you haven’t had it all peaches and cream, you know? Like some shit has probably made you not want to do things at times and not let your guard down and not do what you feel led and called to do. But you are here. And that’s a miracle.” Bieber wants to tell you that you’re a miracle too. He asks himself: “What can I do to be an encouragement?” He wants to say: “You can do it. You are valuable. Whatever you are saying about yourself or believing about yourself is not necessarily true. It’s just not.” “I don’t know if that gives you clarity,” Bieber says, out of words at last. He is trying to be less focused on the outcomes of things. So either way, ultimately, is fine. He grins. “This is just therapy for me.” A version of this story originally appeared in the May 2021 issue with the title ""Amazing Grace."" Secure your copy of the Justin Bieber issue.

I saw clear/official videos of him telling his fans off, spitting on them, etc. Doing really rude stuff to his fans that he should never have done. No matter how angry he was. I did at one point cross the line when it came to the Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber feud when they had a small heated argument in the comment section on Instagram a few months back. I’m not saying it was just Justin but he didn’t act like an adult. I didn’t like his behaviour and just the way he was. I think (it seems) that he’s a little better but I am a fan again.",0

He recently had T. Squints on the show for an interview, and took the opportunity to ask her about her constant state of shock at awards films, before showing a compilation of clips showing her reactions to winning. The only problem is this was taken almost directly from the ""Taylor Swift is surprised"" video supercut posted by Rich/FourFour a week ago.Cue the outrageFrom Rich's blog:I've gotten some good emails in my day, and last week I received one of the all-time best:""Duh! Squee! Duuuuuh!"" I said (not really, but I did go, ""HA!"" in a quiet gym locker room when I initially read it off my Blackberry). Sean assured me I and/or my blog would get credit. Duh squared, that wasn't even a concern. How silly I become when I'm excited! In my response, I stressed how important it was for my friend Kate Spencer (who came up with the idea for the video in the first place) to be credited, too. Kate and me/fourfour and The Fab Life/both attributions -- however they wanted to do it, I asked that they somehow mention us both.Great! Since Jay Leno tends toward the diabolical, I wasn't going to get my hopes up that he'd actually say my name on air. I didn't even know if they'd end up showing it at all. Sean and I went back and forth a few times about getting him the highest-resolution video possible (a tall order, as my video was a compressed compilation of already compressed source material, since so much of it came from YouTube).Fast forward to last night:Taylor's on his couch and he talks to her about winning awards (this is where the clip above begins). After (unconvincingly, I think) explaining that she refrains from being presumptuous while sitting in the audience of awards shows,(clips that originally appeared between the first and the second of the reel shown on The Tonight Show were removed, but the second through fourth appear in the exact succession with almost the same rhythm as my original video). And that's it. Taylor (after letting out a wonderfully appropriate, surprised, ""Oh!"" right before Jay rolled the clip) explained herself without a shred of irony or a seeming understanding of how silly all the instances of gaping mouth come off: ""It's so exciting! I never thought I was gonna be at awards shows and nominated, and then you win them. It's just like, 'What?!' It's always fun!""This is not an obscure work -- it's racked up over 200,000 views in a week! I thought at the very least, he'd give and indication of this thing's preexistence so that his viewers could hunt it down if they were so inclined. That was, apparently, expecting too much.This post is to reclaim due credit -- that is one very tangible function of this blog that I appreciate very much. As with my NPR/cell-phone supercut feud, I am grateful that I don't have to stand by and watch when someone's going to be so rude as to swipe something I worked on just because it was made for the Internet.A little respect for the people providing your content would be nice!But really, the way all this went down is almost as good as if we'd been credited: a chance for righteous indignation is a gift, and I did get to see Taylor Swift's reaction to my video of her reactions, which is deliciously meta and very satisfying in its own right. Her seeming inability to see the humor in her behavior makes me feel like Kate's and my point is even more resounding. She is naive and lacking in self-awareness, it turns out without surprise. What is Jay's excuse?Update: I heard from Sean, who chalks the matter up to the chain of communcation and says thatCredits throw TK, perhaps.

I found him to be a mediocre comedian, a lousy interviewer, and a generally annoying presence. Add to that the fact that he never passes up a chance to tear into West Virginia, thanks to a miserable gig he had one time on Capitol Street, and you can see why I just don’t like the guy.",0

The feeling was that Jay Leno would be ready to hang it up by then and this would give NBC an orderly line of succession. The problem was, nobody asked Leno. This was NBC’s first big mistake–assuming that a guy who stabbed his best friend in the back, and then put all the blame on his long-time manager, who he abruptly fired (before she died of cancer) would give up the show peacefully.",0

He blamed all this on his manager, Helen Kushnick, but only the most naive person would believe that it was not done at Leno’s behest.

The truth is, Leno threw his long-time manager and personal friend under the bus when it became clear that The Tonight Show with Jay Leno was a poorly-produced, barely-watchable disaster. After eighteen months of coming in second to Letterman, even though NBC had a strong prime-time line-up, Leno’s manager took the fall, and then the large-chinned wonder let NBC revamp the show to rescue it from cancellation.",0

O’Brien, who uprooted his entire staff for the cross-country move to take over The Tonight Show, was once again relegated to second-tier status. Now, not only would he still be seen as the “B” show, he’d also be competing against Leno for A-List guests in the same town. On top of that, NBC torpedoed their prime-time line-up for Leno. They also dealt a serious blow to their late-night schedule, a daypart NBC has ruled for nearly 60 years. Conventional wisdom was that the Leno show would be inconsistent in the ratings at best, which in turn would hurt the ratings of the late local news on NBC affiliates, which in turn would hurt the ratings for The Tonight Show.",0

They could have moved him to a different time-slot on different nights, using him in a more effective manner. Some nights he could go on at 8 PM, some nights, later. They could have given Leno a weekly two-hour show on Sunday nights (after football season) and let him try to be the new Ed Sullivan.

The building now houses Fed Ex Kinkos. It was an experiment, meant to save a struggling restaurant. Leno came in, acted nice to everybody, got paid and left town. It was a rare chance to see a nationally-known, but still minor, comedian in an intimate setting. Two weeks earlier, George Carlin sold out The Municipal Auditorium. A couple of months later, Eddie Murphy nearly sold out the Civic Center. But Leno was not well-known enough at that point to sell out a deli. A couple of years later, Leno, making one of his frequent appearances on “Late Night with David Letterman,” told a joke about West Virginia. It was your typical shoeless inbred type of comment, typical among the idiot elite, but he laid it on so thick that Letterman took him to task over it. Leno then told his story about ‘my worst gig ever.” He described Charleston as a filthy little coal-mining town, covered with soot. He complained that the audience at the deli kept coughing throughout his set because they all had black lung. He claimed that he was the only comedian to ever perform in Charleston, and went on and on about what an awful place it was. It was at that moment that I began rooting for Leno to fail. Keep in mind that he took the gig knowing that it was an offbeat location. Remember that he’s from Boston, where an audience will stab you if they don’t think you’re funny. Leno went on national TV and lied about my hometown. I was not surprised that he went on to stab Carson and Letterman in the back. It was no shock that he threw Helen Kushnick under the bus to keep The Tonight Show. It’s certainly no big news when he took the 10PM time slot at NBC, thus dooming Conan O’Brien. I’ve known for two decades what a worthless sack of s**t Leno is. Look what he said about us.",0

In reality, NBC has agreements with music studios to use certain music which would have meant using that song was not really so expensive, and the Petersen Automotive Museum lent the Bugatti for free (which, having it featured on the show gave it an added value as a museum piece): Conan's Payback: How Much Did O'Brien's Bugatti Stunt Cost NBC?

The main bad move they made was in trying to keep both Jay and Conan together. It simply could not be done by 2009. In 2004, when they announced that Conan was going to get the Tonight Show in five years, you could understand that. It was five more years that they kept the cash machine that was late-night at the time going. But by the time 2009 rolled around, Conan wanted the Tonight Show and Jay wanted the Tonight Show. They couldn't both have it. NBC had to make a choice, and in the end, they attempted to keep both and now have neither. 
 
They should have simply let Leno go off and do a show at ABC, or whatever he wanted to do, knowing full well that he was never going to stick around for very long anyway (considering less than four years after he came back to the Tonight Show, he retired again). You put in Conan, you let him grow into the role, and attract a much younger audience than Leno ever could.

The result was an offer from CBS that was not only substantially better than Tonight Show money but also included a large (like 20 or 30 million dollars) penalty payable to Letterman if he did not receive an 11:30pm time slot (the same slot as The Tonight Show). This was the part of the deal NBC could not match unless they were willing to let Leno go and give his show to Letterman.,0

I don’t doubt that CBS got their money’s worth out of Letterman either so looks to me like something that worked out for everyone.

Hate that asshole,"Singer-songwriter and guitar virtuoso John Mayer had a song on his major label debut record, Room For Squares, that foreshadowed a trend in his personal life. The blunt tune, ""My Stupid Mouth,"" recounts a very awkward date. ""My stupid mouth / Has got me in trouble / I said too much again / To a date over dinner yesterday,"" Mayer croons. ""And I could see / She was offended / She said, 'Well, anyway...' / Just dying for a subject change."" The song continues to explain his penchant for putting his foot in his mouth, leading to the concluding promise, ""I'm never speaking up again starting now."" The multi-Grammy winner's ex-girlfriends, including but not limited to the likes of Jessica Simpson, Katy Perry, Taylor Swift, and Jennifer Aniston, probably wish he'd kept the promise he made to the world in 2001 — but a quick Google search reveals that he definitely didn't. However, Mayer also happens to be one of the best guitarists of his generation, who can also write a pop ballad on demand whenever he feels like it, so it's no surprise that he's continued to have professional success, even as he's spewed TMI about his personal life all over the press. But even Mayer's most loyal fans — and Hollywood, for that matter — have their limits. It's probably partially why 2017's The Search for Everything is his most forgettable album to date, no matter its quality. Let's consider some of the real reasons fans turned on John Mayer.",0

John Mayer and pop singer-turned-fashion mogul Jessica Simpson dated for about two years in the mid-2000s, but in 2010, Mayer revealed intimate details about their sex life in a scandalous Playboy interview. He infamously called Simpson ""sexual napalm,"" but unfortunately didn't stop there. Comparing her to a drug, he said, ""Yeah, that girl is like crack cocaine to me. Sexually it was crazy."" Yikes. For her part, Simpson was understandably hurt and ""felt betrayed"" by her ex's very public comments. Admitting to Oprah Winfrey that she couldn't bring herself to read the article, she said, ""I was so disappointed in him ... It made me so sad, and it was really discouraging, because that's not the John that I knew."" While Mayer apologized (presumably via email), Simpson added, ""I don't accept it ... I'm just gonna let that go. That part of my life is over."" It wasn't until her 2020 memoir, Open Book, that Simpson actually revealed how unhealthy her relationship with Mayer was. Per The New York Times, she wrote that she began to rely on alcohol to calm her insecurities surrounding Mayer, for whom she never felt smart enough, but noted that the Playboy interview ""made it easy for [her] to walk away."" When asked about how Mayer might respond to the book, Simpson told The New York Times, ""I don't care."" We don't blame you, Jessica.",0

Hate that asshole,"Unfortunately, John Mayer's extreme public comments don't stop with past loves.

Taking something that's seen as a struggle and making it work for you, or you'll die inside. Not to say that my struggle is like the collective struggle of Black America. But maybe my struggle is similar to one Black dude's."" Um, okay. Mayer also used the N-word when talking about being accepted among the Black community. In response, rapper-actor Ice-T tweeted (via The Guardian), ""Wow! That's sad because I liked that dude ... Well there go all his black fans and his hood pass ... Damn John!!"" Mayer quickly apologized to fans on Twitter (via ABC News). ""I am sorry that I used the word,"" he wrote. ""And it's such a shame that I did because the point I was trying to make was in the exact opposite spirit of the word itself. It was arrogant of me to think I could intellectualize using it because I realize that there's no intellectualizing a word that is so emotionally charged.""

Hate that asshole,"Unfortunately, John Mayer never stopped putting his foot in his mouth during that fateful 2010 Playboy interview. It was largely overlooked at the time, but he also used a homophobic slur when describing an encounter with Perez Hilton, during which the guitarist kissed the gossip blogger as a ""joke"" on New Year's Eve. ""I remember seeing Perez Hilton flitting about this club and acting as though he had just invented homosexuality,"" Mayer told the outlet of why he pulled the stunt. ""All of a sudden I thought, I can outgay this guy right now. I grabbed him and gave him the dirtiest, tongue-iest kiss I have ever put on anybody — almost as if I hated f**s."" Of course, nothing about that is funny, and GLAAD quickly called for an apology from the Grammy Award winner. ""Just as Mayer indicated in his [Twitter] apology, that he meant no offense in his use of the racist slur, we hope the intent behind his use of the F-word was not malicious,"" the organization stated in part in a blog post. ""As a public figure with millions of fans, Mayer should be more cognizant of the impact his casual use of both slurs can have.""

Hate that asshole,"John Mayer bragged about breaking up with everyone's best friend John Mayer and Friends star Jennifer Aniston dated on and off between 2008 and 2009. And, true to form, he's made some very public comments about their breakup. The first was outside of a gym, as E! News reported, when the musician said, ""I'm the a**hole. I burned the American flag. I basically murdered an ideal."" We have questions about why he'd brag about that, but Aniston went on to defend Mayer during an interview with Vogue in 2008. ""He had to put that out there that he broke up with me. And especially because it's me. It's not just some girl he's dating. I get it. We're human,"" she said. ""But I feel seriously protective of him and us. Trust me, you'll never see that happen again from that man."" Mayer definitely proved Aniston's prediction wrong in his 2010 Playboy interview. While he at least cleared the (low) bar of not talking about their sex life, he did basically diss her for aging: ""I think she's still hoping it goes back to 1998. She saw my involvement in technology as courting distraction. And I always said, 'These are the new rules.'"" He admitted that he'd ""always"" love Aniston. How sweet ... until it's not: ""In some ways I wish I could be with her. But I can't change the fact that I need to be 32."" Ouch!",0

Hate that asshole,"John Mayer once appeared to be very full of himself John Mayer is obviously an extremely talented musician, and you'd be hard-pressed to find a fellow guitarist or singer-songwriter who would deny that fact. Even Eric Clapton once called Mayer a ""master"" guitarist, saying, ""He's extremely gifted. His facility is phenomenal."" But did the constant praise go to the ""Waiting on the World to change"" hitmaker's head? It certainly seemed that way during his notorious 2010 interviews with Rolling Stone and Playboy. Mayer has often said he wants to settle down with someone, but has also made some mind-boggling comments about his criteria for planting real roots with a significant other. ""Do you think it's going to take meeting someone who I admire more than I admire myself?"" he mused to Rolling Stone. We won't deny that Mayer's honest, but he has also had a hard time admitting that he needs to dial it all back sometimes. ""I come on very strong. I am a very ... I'm just very. V-E-R-Y. And if you can't handle very, then I'm a d**che bag,"" Mayer told Playboy. ""But I think the world needs a little very."" Judging from the swift backlash reaction to both of these interviews, the world essentially said, ""Thanks, but no thanks, John."" Even Mayer would later admit that he was a ""recovered ego addict"" to MSNBC in 2015. Perhaps that's why Forbes once attempted to answer the question: ""Why John Mayer Is Music's Forgotten Superstar.""",0

Hate that asshole,"Amid John Mayer's disastrous interviews in 2010, there were also some pulled quotes that were just, well, gross. No one really needed to know about his bathroom habits, for example, but the ""Who Says"" singer shared his preferences with Rolling Stone. ""I've got to go to the stall,"" he said. ""I can't get a good flow going when I'm out in the world. But then, of course, you run the risk of people thinking you s**t all the time."" Unfortunately, that was just the beginning of the things we all wished we didn't know about Mayer ... because he also spoke at length about self-pleasure at the time. ""I am the new generation of masturbator... I've seen it all,"" he told Rolling Stone. ""Before I make coffee, I've seen more butt holes than a proctologist does in a week."" Apologies, readers — we wish we could unsee that quote, too. Mayer also admitted to Playboy that he, um, fantasizes about his exes: ""Rather than meet somebody new, I would rather go home and replay the amazing experiences I've already had."" It should go without saying that sex and sexuality are nothing to be ashamed of, but some details should probably be kept private — especially when most of your exes are famous, too.",0

He should be in the “I’m a bitch and I should never be able to have a microphone in front of me” music award. Hate that asshole,"He shouldn’t be your boyfriend. Sex is not love. If a guy wants sex with you and always talks about sex with you then sex with you has little to do with him caring about you as a person, it has everything to do with how attractive you are to him and the fact that you have a vagina and he wants to use it for his pleasure. I guy can think you’re attractive and not love you, a guy can agree to be in a relationship with you and not love you but he knows being in a relationship with you can up his chances of having sex with you(some guys are desperate and will do hurtful selfish stupid things to get laid with a girl they want). Do research to learn what love truly is, the holy bible is a good start because the meaning of love comes straight from the one who invented love. Secondly learn to love yourself first before making someone your boyfriend because if you don’t think much of yourself and you don’t think you are good enough to be treated well and with respect or not good enough to have certain people in your life then you will always meet people who see that flaw in you and they will take advantage of that and treat you exactly the way you feel about yourself, they won’t acknowledge your feelings, they’ll blame you for the way they’ve made you feel, they’ll blame you for their bad behavior and use you for their own selfish pleasures and not care if it hurts or destroys you. Once you Learn to love yourself you will won’t tolerate disrespect nor anyone using you or trying to use you and you will recognize when someone doesn’t love you when their just bullshitting you to get what they want from you. Please take this advice seriously because there’s too many men in the world that behaves like the one I previously described. It’s likely you’ll meet more guys with selfish intentions than guys who have good intentions. Stay woke! Love ya (:",0

Hate that asshole,"* Change the key, so you can play the same chord shapes for a different key
 * Change the sound, to make it brighter and less deep
 * Lower the action.
In recording, guitarists often put capos on to change the sound of the guitar, so you can have two guitar parts that don’t get in the way of each other, and to allow the guitarist to play different chords from one part to the other. Some guitarists took those out of the studio, such as Mark Knopfler with Romeo and Juliet, enabling him to play open tuning live at the correct pitch.

 * If you play bends, you will have far more problems
 * If you use a tremolo arm, then it will not necessarily function correctly.
 * You lose range on the guitar, and can’t play the lowest notes
 * The sound of the guitar without a capo is generally richer
 * If you are given the regular chords, you have to transpose in order to use a capo.

But despite her numerous mess-ups, many still quietly root for her ""comeback."" What's funny, however, is that Lindsay has had several comebacks over the years, from her role in The Canyons to her own reality show on Oprah Winfrey's OWN. None of those projects panned out well for her, so now MTV is giving her a third chance to win back her former glory with a new reality show. But what people don't seem to realize is that Lindsay isn't entitled to all these chances. Judging by her past behavior, her current career (or what's left of it) is exactly what she deserves.

""As we pulled up to the Fontainebleau, a bright-orange parking cone was blocking the entrance,"" Jacquelynn Powers wrote in the piece. ""Not accustomed to waiting, apparently, she lowered the car's window and shouted, 'Move that cone. I'm Lindsay Lohan.' And it was done."" It sounds ridiculous, but Lindsay thinks being an actress absolves her of all accountability. For example, in 2007 when she was arrested for reckless driving, a witness told TMZ that Lindsay had zero qualms about being arrested for her 80 mph joyride through Santa Monica. ""I'm a celebrity. I'm not going to get in trouble,"" she reportedly told him. And if you think all that sounds bad, you should check out her rider. When appearing on Russian TV for an interview, she demanded a private jet, security, a 1-year Russian visa extension, 500,000 British pounds, a Ritz-Carlton penthouse suite, and oh yeah, a meeting with President Vladimir Putin.

But possibly the biggest fib Lilo has ever allegedly told was when she revealed she had a miscarriage on her reality show. ""Lindsay was never pregnant during filming the reality show for OWN, or in the months after,"" an insider told Radar. ""Lindsay knew she was being perceived as a total slacker, not showing up on time for photo shoots, call times and refusing to shoot. So this is what Lindsay does.""

Learn More Why You Rarely Hear About Lindsay Lohan Anymore Plenty of actors get famous in their youth, appear in a bunch of TV shows and movies, then fade into relative obscurity. A lot of the time, this occurs due to factors totally independent of talent, work ethic, or any of the other metrics upon which a casting director might base a decision. One minute the public loves you, and the next, they don't — so it goes in Hollywood. But Lindsay Lohan is different. Originally celebrated for her relatability and charm, as showcased in Disney films like The Parent Trap (1998) and Freaky Friday (2003), Lohan then found acclaim in the razor-sharp teen comedy Mean Girls (2004). However, Lohan soon became a cautionary tale. While she appeared to be on track for movie stardom at one point, various problems in her personal life eventually turned Lohan into a toxic commodity. Or at least, that's how the widely-held perception goes. But popular discourse has changed a little bit since Lohan's ""downfall"" in the late '00s. The media back then — and not just the celebrity-focused tabloids, even if they were the worst offenders — went pretty rough on a handful of famous young women, particularly Lohan. The public is no longer certain that such treatment was fair or responsible. In that spirit, we're here to investigate why we don't hear much about Lindsay Lohan anymore.",0
1425602330922299395,"Not funny (sorry), I hate lindsay Lohan (shes a dumb bithch), okay I might do that","Lindsay Lohan has had some major difficulties with alcohol and drugs over the years. There's no need to get judgmental about that: Every addict is someone's friend, someone's family member, and above all, a human being. But the fact remains that as of 2013, Lohan had been to court-ordered rehab six times, according to CNN. Moreover, Lohan's grand total of intoxicant-related incidents is too long to list. Now, Lohan hasn't actually gotten in trouble for anything in a good long while. But her spotlight didn't fade simply because she used to enjoy a good time. For one thing, her track record makes her an insurance liability on multi-million dollar movie sets. For another thing, Lohan's chaotic personal life eventually overshadowed her career accomplishments. Most of her heyday projects didn't have much staying power, as it turns out. In the minds of today's media-consuming public, she's known for Mean Girls and The Parent Trap and that's pretty much it. There was a period of time when most of her work consisted of self-aware appearances as ""herself"" on long-running shows like Anger Management and Glee. Ironic self-deprecation might be funny once in a while, but when it's the only trick a performer can still pull off, it becomes depressing.",0
1425602330922299395,"Not funny (sorry), I hate lindsay Lohan (shes a dumb bithch), okay I might do that","For the most part, Lindsay Lohan's legal problems are related to her substance abuse issues. Her rap sheet is a little too long to list in full, but basically, Lohan managed to cram the period between 2007 and 2013 full of DUI arrests, lightning-quick stints in jail, probation violations, and one charge of cocaine procession. As a result, she has had to jump through a bunch of procedural hoops and pay a ton of money. In addition, assuming various allegations against her are true, it appears Lohan is, or has been, a hardcore kleptomaniac. The troubled star has been accused of stealing from parties, a wide variety of friends, a jewelry store or two, the wardrobe departments of her own movies, and from ex-boyfriend Egor Tarabasov. Lohan's new friend Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman better make sure he hides the good palace silverware, otherwise Lohan might drop it in her purse next time he's too busy ordering the assassination of one of his critics to notice.",0
1425602330922299395,"Not funny (sorry), I hate lindsay Lohan (shes a dumb bithch), okay I might do that","When we ask, ""Why don't we hear as much about famous actor so-and-so anymore?,"" what we usually mean is, ""Why don't they appear in movies or TV shows as much as they used to?"" But in the specific case of Lindsay Lohan, we also mean, ""Why isn't she still in movies, TV, or on the news all the time?"" Partially, this is because Lohan lives in Dubai now, which makes her a lot less accessible to the American press. It also happens to be the case that during the mid-'00s, celeb-centric media developed a fixation on famous young women who were enthusiastic participants in recreational nightlife activities. This bunch included Lohan, hotel chain heiress Paris Hilton, Lionel Richie's daughter and eventual TV personality Nicole Richie, and, perhaps most notably, Kim Kardashian, who swung her brief phase of arguably unearned notoriety into a media and fashion empire that carries on to this day. While the Kardashian brand flourished, the media obsession with Hilton, Richie, and Lohan had pretty much run its course by 2010. Partly, that's probably because the public got worn out from hearing about the same celebrities getting in trouble all the time. But maybe after Lohan narrowly avoided felony charges and Hilton wound up doing jail time in 2007, we realized, as a society, that paying attention to this mayhem was just pouring metaphorical gasoline on the fire.",0
1425602330922299395,"Not funny (sorry), I hate lindsay Lohan (shes a dumb bithch), okay I might do that","There's at least a little bit of a sexist double standard happening here We're not suggesting Lindsay Lohan isn't responsible for her own choices, nor do we want to sound certain that an alternate reality version of Lohan who never did any drugs would've had a more successful run in Hollywood. But consider this: At one point in his life, Robert Downey Jr. was getting wasted to a degree that Lohan could not conceive of during her most depressing benders ... and Hollywood gave him a second chance. Violent, substance-related accusations have circled Johnny Depp for years, but a whole lot of people are eager to see him exonerated. In fact, if we look from a broader perspective and think about figures like Hunter S. Thompson, Ernest Hemingway, and virtually every male rock musician ever, it appears that heavy drinking and drug use among men is considered less of a liability or a character flaw, and more like an indicator of creative genius. But of course, nobody has ever thought Lindsay Lohan's alcoholism and drug addiction is a sign that she's secretly a artistic talent constrained by a square world. Same goes for Courtney Love, Amy Winehouse, Demi Lovato, and a score of others — they're written off as train wrecks. So while we can't blame the disappointments of Lohan's acting career entirely on systemic misogyny, there's surely a shot or two of 100 proof sexism in that causal cocktail.",0
1425602330922299395,"Not funny (sorry), I hate lindsay Lohan (shes a dumb bithch), okay I might do that","I Know Who Killed Me was a dud Intended as Lindsay Lohan's groundbreaking transition into edgy, adult roles, I Know Who Killed Me (2007) was shredded by critics and largely ignored by moviegoers. As The Guardian recalls, the production had to contort itself around Lohan's court-mandated rehab stints, plus a handful of other Lohan-related obstacles. This included so many paparazzi, some of them lurk in the background of shots that ended up in the finished movie. Within the first 10 minutes, it becomes immediately obvious that director Chris Sivertson very much wants I Know Who Killed Me to be Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me (1992). But is it really fair to label I Know Who Killed Me as discount David Lynch and toss it aside? Could it be that the world of 2007 was already too sick of hearing about Lindsay Lohan to give the film an honest chance? As critic Charles Bramesco writes, ""The baggage [Lohan] dropped off at set only served to deepen and enrich the subtext of a stealth noir gem, one that gestures to a long-bygone era of movie stardom through the framework of a cheaper and dirtier sort of serial killer thriller."" As of this moment, I Know Who Killed Me is available for free on Crackle, if that sort of thing interests you. Fair warning: Dry ice and sharp objects interact with human flesh and bone in a manner that leans a little NC-17.",0
1425602330922299395,"Not funny (sorry), I hate lindsay Lohan (shes a dumb bithch), okay I might do that","The Canyons proved to be another flop Stephen Rodrick's 2013 New York Times Magazine feature, ""Here is What Happens When You Cast Lindsay Lohan in Your Movie,"" is a whole lot more memorable than its subject matter, The Canyons (2013). The microbudget brainchild of director Paul Schrader and writer Bret Easton Ellis, The Canyons was met with critical scorn and was not widely viewed. This isn't necessarily surprising, as it's a erotic thriller with a serious mean streak — not exactly mainstream fare. Still, the film's dead-on-arrival status proved that controversy alone cannot always carry a film to profit. The fact that Lohan, according to Schrader, could not be bothered to promote the film probably didn't help push it in front of anyone's eyeballs. But more importantly, a few years after the movie's release, a deluge of rape and assault allegations ruined the public's ability to comfortably watch Lohan's Canyons co-star James Deen pretend to abuse a woman on screen. Thus, The Canyons is pretty unlikely to ever become an ironic cult favorite along the lines of Lohan's other ""serious"" movie fiasco, I Know Who Killed Me. But even before all that fallout hit, as Rodrick's piece chronicles, this production was caught in the ongoing tornado of upheaval that defined Lindsay Lohan's life at the time. It seems reasonable to suggest, in hindsight, that maybe Schrader and Ellis should've known better.",0
1425602330922299395,"Not funny (sorry), I hate lindsay Lohan (shes a dumb bithch), okay I might do that","Lohan still acts and sings more than you might realize Clearly, Lindsay Lohan's acting career hit its high water mark with Mean Girls. Ever since she played Cady Heron, however, she's drifted further and further away from acting, to the point that it has ceased to be her primary occupation. So, if you wanted to make the case that she's more than a little washed up as an actress, you could credibly do so. But that doesn't mean she's stopped acting completely — or performing in other ways. In fact, Lohan appeared in a video-on-demand Underworld-ish movie called Among The Shadows in 2019. She also showed up on season two of Sick Note alongside Rupert Grint and Nick Frost in 2018, and is attached to a Mickey Rourke project called Cursed. Sure, Disney's probably not calling her agent as much these days, but it's not like she's doing nothing. As far as Lohan's music career goes, it may surprise you to learn that she's quietly started putting new music out again as of 2020. This ends a long stretch of sonic inactivity, reaching back to the release of her 2005 album, A Little More Personal (Raw). Whether she's on the way back to her platinum-selling heights of yore remains to be seen, but we must admit, the lyric ""you're like Xanax to me"" is certainly not something that would have appeared in any of Lohan's teen pop tunes from back in the day.",0

Even nowadays, when drugs and alcohol have ostensibly been removed from the picture, Lindsay Lohan's career continues to take an unpredictable route. As it turns out, she's perfectly capable of getting involved in all kinds of weird stuff beyond singing, acting, and getting obliterated after dark. In 2019, Lohan didn't last long as a judge on the Australian version of The Masked Singer. Her MTV reality series Lindsay Lohan's Beach Club only made it through a single season before the featured Mykonos resort — one of Lohan's personal business ventures — ceased operations. However, People reports two other Greek entertainment establishments Lohan co-owns remain open for business. Moreover, she made several million selling the Mykonos location. Maybe Lohan managed to fail upwards for a change? While Lohan has had some success as a nightclub entrepreneur, her attempts at humanitarian interventionism have been a far more mixed bag. In 2018, Lohan got into a bizarre altercation in Moscow with a woman she accused of child trafficking. Maybe when it comes to handling the Syrian refugee crisis, Lohan would be better off supporting international organizations staffed by trained professionals, instead of harassing a family she arbitrarily selected off the street in a clueless attempt to look like a hero on Instagram.",0
1425602330922299395,"Not funny (sorry), I hate lindsay Lohan (shes a dumb bithch), okay I might do that","Lohan has a jewelry influencer thing going now Back in the good old days, if you were a celebrity and wanted to make some extra money with a high-profile advertising gig, you had to cross your fingers and hope that a major company would get in touch with you to appear in one of their television or print commercials. Nowadays, things work a little differently. Brands will hire celebrities to push their products on social media, which has got to save quite a bit on marketing costs. Lindsay Lohan's taken that paradigm a step further with the U.K.-based jewelry company Lily Baker Jewels, with which she co-designed a line of accessories. Notably, many of the bracelets, earrings, necklaces, and other objects in the collection draw from ancient and mystical motifs. Other accessories are more understated, though every piece is appropriately sparkly. It's hard to determine Lohan's genuine level of participation or interest in this venture. Celebs do tend to exaggerate their level of involvement with the products they slap their names on, after all. But Lohan has been heavily promoting the collection on social media, to the point that she seems at least somewhat engaged in the marketing process. As many celebrities do only the cursory amount of touting for these sorts of collaborations, that's worth noting.",0

This seemed to be the case in January 2021, when a 20-year-old fan named Alana contacted Lohan about a proposed Cameo recording. According to Variety, Alana was struggling to come out to her parents. So, in a TikTok video, she floated the idea of hiring the actor to reveal the truth for her. In a video, Lohan responded to Alana with the following words of wisdom: ""You are about to take a very big step in telling your parents who you truly are and what you want them to accept of you — and I think you should do it yourself. I think that coming from you, you'll feel a lot of power and strength. And it's important that you are who you truly are, and that you love yourself and that you can live by that and tell your parents that."" The clip became a minor viral sensation, and had the world thinking that maybe Lindsay Lohan was more than a vapid fallen celebrity cliché after all.

The reality show follows Lohan and her business partner Panos Spentzos as they open a beachfront club in Mykonos, Greece, along with the nine conventionally hot American people she hires to work there as “VIP hosts.” Lohan isn’t subtle about what she’s trying to achieve now: She wants to be Lisa Vanderpump, at the helm of her own nightlife empire, in a role that largely presents her as operating above the drama, rather than the clear instigator of it.",0

1425602330922299395,"Not funny (sorry), I hate lindsay Lohan (shes a dumb bithch), okay I might do that","1. She isn't creating the foundation for one — If Ms. Lohan wanted an acting career again she would be doing stagework and small roles in independent films. You don't become an actor of note from reality television. She needs to be working now for the future, and she isn't.
2. Her looks are fading — She's in the 30s, but looks like she is in her 40s. Since she's not a strong enough actor to play character roles, she would have to depend upon her appearance to get her roles and that isn't going to be easy.
3. Her substance abuse issues — That's always going to be in the background of any decision to employ her. She has a well-documented history of substance abuse and legal issues that are going to make a lot of productions leery about hiring her.
4. Her limited range — She's not a dramatic actor. She's not a Shakespearean. She's not an action star. She can no longer be used in children's roles or roles where the program is supposed to appeal to children. She never became a better comedic actor. Basically, other than playing some variation of herself, there doesn't seem to be a niche for her.
5. The competition is too fierce — There are several hundred female actors who are around Lohan's age and who have far less baggage. It would be easier and less problematic to hire one of them instead of rolling the dice with Lohan and seeing what happens.",0

2. She's profoundly insecure — She really needs to run her public statements through her agent, as they make her sound petty and mean-spirited. That's not a sign of a secure person.
3. She's immature — For a woman in her early thirties, she comes across like a rather spoiled teenager. She doesn't seem to have matured from her adversity; nor does she seem to have learned anything from it.
4. She's never had a real life — She was her family's breadwinner from an early age, and she's never done anything but perform. The majority of her life has been spent in front of cameras; and every aspect of it has been scrutinized by the media and by millions of people. That's obviously not “normal.”
5. She's likely suffering from some form of mental illness — She's had problems with substance abuse, the legal system, her finances, and her professed career is in tatters. Most people would have quietly left the stage and found themselves a far less destructive lifestyle. Lohan, however, keeps diving back into the shallow end of the pool, seemingly hoping that she doesn't hit the bottom again. It's clear that she has several issues with mental illness that are being poorly treated.

But yeah keep crying mf,"In the long term, Messi's departure could have direct implications on Real Madrid in the transfer market, too. Los Blancos have long been linked with PSG superstar Kylian Mbappe, to the point where many have speculated that his move to the Spanish capital is a matter of when, not if. PSG may have unlimited funds, but even for the Qatari-backed club, keeping Mbappe without running amok of Financial Fair Play (FFP) shouldn't be possible, even if FFP is largely a charade. After you've already committed tons of money to various free agents, spent €60 million on Achraf Hakimi, recently re-signed Neymar in a deal that reportedly pays the Brazilian €31 million per season, and added the most expensive player in the world on top of an already hefty wage bill, conventional wisdom suggests some kind of sacrifice has to be made.",0

1419497428378607617,You are the loser. And how does that prove Messi is a loser.  But yeah keep crying mf,"Wait- Messi carried his team to the World Cup final in 2014. Only narrowly losing to a great German team. Golden Ball, 2014 World Cup. What is the golden ball? The best player in the tournament-Messi won it. With 2 and often 3 players marking him-hanging on him for each and every game. That’s exhausting work- go back and watch how opposing players are literally hanging on to Messi-how much more work he has to do create space than anyone else. No other player was ever feared as much as Messi-including in the World Cup and in international play. Those who suggest Messi can’t play outside Barcelona either aren’t watching-or have eaten sour grapes. Somewhere they omitted Messi’s argentine team in the WC final and Messi winning the Golden Ball, maybe they didn’t watch the World Cup after Portugal was ousted and couldn’t make it out of their group. The sins of ommission. In fact, if Higuain makes that lay up early against Germany, it would’ve likely been a very different outcome. Suggesting Pele and Maradona are better because they won world cups implies they could have carried the 2014 Argentina team to a victory over Germany- no chance. Messi can’t be responsible for the team assembled or be responsible for the current talent. To suggest Pele was solely responsible for Brazil’s success slights the rest of those great Brazilian teams. Maradona’s hand of god (blatant cheat) propels them past England. So many things have to fall in line to win a World Cup that no player- be it Pele or Maradona or Muller can control them all. There are simply too many variables across too many games. Some players had great strings of luck- which then somehow gets perverted into the idea that they alone inspired their teammates to greater heights and carried the team in some fashion or another, as if that wasn’t their dream since the first moment they kicked a ball. Getting to the World Cup final is by no means a failure- it’s a great feat. Put to rest the notion that Messi has not succeeded on an international level- no one with any sense can suggest that making a World Cup final and winning the Golden Ball are not considered successful.",1
1419497428378607617,You are the loser. And how does that prove Messi is a loser.  But yeah keep crying mf,"However, sports are viewed on an emotional level that really can’t be separated from a players level of success and ability. Messi will lack the adulation of Argentina that vaulted Maradona to unprecedented heights of fame and love from his country-for a time-as it is the same with Brazil and Pele. I suppose in this era where vanity and self promotion are king, I can see where the goal poaching Ronaldo is propped up as Messi’s rival by fanboys-must be his underwear line and his unabashed lack of humility when showing the crowd his abs and thighs every chance he gets, or his publicist making photo ops out of every charity event he attends to show us all how selfless he is. It’s the emotional evaluation of a player that says Messi can’t be on par or better than the greats of Pele or Maradona- there is nothing rational about their evaluation-we hardly have any footage of Pele that isn’t a grainy blur. I’m not suggesting that these players aren’t great- but there are so many other intangibles other than than a rational clinical view of a players skills that are wrapped up in their persona that you simply can’t distill the actual player’s ability out of it. Unfortunately, Messi lacks that now- but based on the number of Messi jerseys I see at all my sons football tournies- I’m guessing the upcoming generation will venerate Messi as he deserves and realize Messi would’ve been megging Pele, Maradona, and any other great name silly had they been on the same pitch. Messi at his best is just unparalleled, otherworldly-he does things no other player can do-it will be recognized in time when the children who are watching Messi now grow up and become the sports writers who are largely responsible for our views and choices on who is the greatest.",1

Very effective it was to, for a brief time between 89-91 he was maybe the best footballer in England. Also he played in a brilliant side (hurts to say I am a Everton fan).

It was really a shame to see the dejected and isolated Messi against Croatia. He can't do it every time. The last WC he almost single handedly cruised then to final but lost out again due to the lack of support from his peers.

And Brangelina was, aptly, the ultimate celebrity brand. Both are Oscar winners, among the highest paid stars in the film business (Pitt is said to be worth $300m, Jolie $150m), mainstream draws and indie icons, and of course utterly gorgeous (Pitt was twice voted the sexiest man alive by People magazine, while Jolie was named sexiest woman alive by Esquire magazine in 2004). But Brangelina also became a byword for celebrity altrusim and consciousness-raising. Pitt accompanied Jolie on many of her UNHCR trips, they opened schools in war-torn countries, and three of their six children were adopted from countries brutalised by conflict and poverty – 20-year-old Maddox is Cambodian, 17-year-old Pax is Vietnamese and 16-year-old Zahara is Ethiopian. They even managed to manipulate the media to their own ends. Faced with the inevitability of being papped when their daughter Shiloh was born in 2006, Jolie and Pitt auctioned off the photoshoot to People magazine in the US and Hello! in Britain for $7.6m. Two years later, when twins Knox and Vivienne arrived, they sold the shoot to the same magazines for an estimated $14m, making them the most expensive celebrity photos in history. On both occasions, the proceeds went to the Jolie-Pitt Foundation to fund humanitarian projects. As a couple, they seemed too good (or at least too successful) to be true.",0

Five days after the incident, Jolie filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences and stating that her decision to end the marriage “was made for the health of the family”. Pitt admitted he had an alcohol problem (he attended Alcoholics Anonymous after their separation) and that he had yelled at one of his children, but has always denied being physically abusive to them.

One of the reasons children need to have these rights is because without them they are vulnerable to living unsafe, unhealthy lives.” She may be talking about children in general, but it sounds personal. In the custody battle, much of the world appears to have taken sides. Some family law attorneys have criticised Jolie for wanting her children to testify against their father, while Jolie suggests it would be a betrayal of their rights for her to let it rest.

Jolie’s father, the actor Jon Voight, was Oscar-nominated for Midnight Cowboy (1969) and won best actor for Coming Home in 1979, but was a less impressive parent in Jolie’s eyes. She says her mother sacrificed her career to bring up her two children (Jolie has an older brother, James Haven), largely as a single parent. “My mom married at 21, and by the time she was 25 she was divorced with two little kids. She couldn’t be the artist she wanted to be, but she raised her children with art and creativity. Even if it was a birthday party, she found a way to put those talents to use.”",0

Her mother suggested her boyfriend move in to stop her leaving home and going further off the rails. Jolie was anti-establishment, and outspoken, but she was also a mess. “It took me a good while to feel I could be of use to anyone because I felt for a long time that I was a little crazy, that I was a little unhinged, and not settled.

To be around all these young people who have, for good reason, a sense of fight and rebellion and willingness to get in there and bleed if necessary for something they know is wrong – it reminds me of who I was when I was younger.

Since her complaints sound both unfounded and slightly unhinged, the media has been doing her a huge favor by not reporting on them in detail.
2. Her films haven't been doing well — Malificent in 2014 was her last big hit and that had her in what was more a supporting role. While she's scheduled to reprise that character in 2019, her other recent acting roles haven't been well received at the box office.
3. Her physical health has been an issue — Jolie underwent a radical double mastectomy in an effort to prevent breast cancer for which she was at high risk. She also underwent the removal of her ovaries which brought on premature menopause. She's had at least two major surgeries, along with several cosmetic ones within less than five years, meaning that she'd spent a long time convalescing in private.
4. She's moved more into producing films — Perhaps as a long-term business strategy. Jolie has transitioned more into film production. That means less time in front of the camera and more raising financing and making business decisions.
5. She has six children- We have to assume that she's spending as much of her free time as she can raising her family. She's been doing that out of spotlight and that may be why she is seen far less often than before.",0

1418705315063865345,Unpopular opinion but Angelina Jolie is a piece of trash,"I agree with the questioner. I too think Angelina Jolie is overrated as an actress. She has won an Oscar for Girl interrupted, which i don’t agree. Her performance was just good, not Oscar worthy in my opinion. Most of her movies are commercially successful ( Gone in 60 seconds, Tomb Rider, Salt, Mr and Mrs Smith, the tourist ) but objectively she has not much range. She is not very versatile. She has a star power no doubt but i don’t think it comes so much from her acting talent. However, her performance, her best so far in my opinion, in Gia i must say was fantastic. She killed it. Then, again she was playing a character very similar to herself. I have not been impressed by her other movies. I think she is considered an A list actor because she is or she was at least ‘’a sure thing’’. She had major ticket sales. She has won several Razzie nominations for worst actress but she has yet to win.",0

1418705315063865345,Unpopular opinion but Angelina Jolie is a piece of trash,"Angelina began her career with such movies as Foxfire. In the beginning and into the 2000′s she had relationships with her costars/headliners. In Foxfire she even switched teams and began a relationship with that costar as well(Jenny Shimizu) I think the exception might have been her next film, Girl Interrupted. Winona Ryder had the lead in that one. Then there was Pushing Tin in which she married her costar and famously wore his blood around her neck(Billy Bob Thorton) She then met Brad Pitt in Mr. And Mrs Smith, stole Jennifer Anniston’s husband in this one broke up a family and married him. She continued to acquire children and husbands and even had three natural children with him.(Twins and one other) I don’t doubt she has talent. But giving her habit of acquiring husbands and children, her life has overshadowed her work. You never think of her work first when her name is mentioned. It's her brooding quirkiness you call to mind. Maybe Angelina Jolie is so good at reinventing herself she has reinvented herself out of a marriage and a job. Haven’t heard of any new roles lately.",0

To me she’s in the league of Julia Roberts, Halle Berry and Emma Stone who all are mediocre at best in both talent and beauty yet keep getting shoved down our throats as ‘greats’.

Either they’re not offered to her or she’s choosing roles she thinks will make more money.

Not only that, he named his company MICRO SOFT. Come on. This is the best possible way for him to indulge in sph (small penis humiliation). Whenever someone introduces him on stage, or mentions his company infront of him, he's being humiliated (and you can tell he likes it). Plus, he's been married to one woman his entire life. Billionaires never do that (Elon musk is 8 times poorer than him, and he's already on his fourth gf). He and his wife have probably come to an ""agreement"" (if you know what I mean).

It is ambitious, presenting a cavalcade of snapshots from Bieber’s sporadic and tumultuous career. It jumps between messages, genres and styles in unorthodox and seemingly random ways. Most of the tracks on the album are good, if not great on their own (except “Peaches,” but we will get to that later).",0

It feels like an EP with singles jammed in as an afterthought. The cherry on top of all this confusion is Bieber’s choice to include a Martin Luther King Jr. speech as an interlude, and to sample another of his speeches at the beginning of “2 Much.” But at least the guest artists — Skrillex, Chance the Rapper and Daniel Caesar — are strong choices, collaborating surprisingly well with Bieber.",0

These two ideas never seem to connect coherently in the album, so instead of making some deeper revelation that connects individual love to wide-reaching social issues, it just seems tasteless, like couples that kiss in front of war memorials.",0

Without question, many of the ballads on this album are incredibly pleasant to listen to. Most of the music comfortably plays into pop music clichés like the bubbly dancehall feeling of “Love You Different” (which is very similar to Bieber’s 2015 hit “Sorry”), the Nickelback-like pop-rock aesthetic of “Ghost” and the almost corporate sound of “Anyone.”",0

Additionally, Justice is far less focused — “Peaches,” for example, is downright hard to listen to. The lyrics are cringeworthy at best and derisive at worst. As I listened, I dreaded the chorus: “I got my peaches out in Georgia (Oh, yeah, shit) / I get my weed from California (That’s that shit) / I took my chick up to the North, yeah (Bad-ass bitch) / I get my light right from the source, yeah (Yeah, that’s it).”",0

Daniel Caesar’s and Giveon’s performances are pretty strong — but not strong enough to save this pop-R&B track from sounding like it was made by a high schooler with GarageBand.",0

The lyrics are well-written: “Everybody knows my past now / Like my house was always made of glass / And maybe that’s the price you pay / For the money and fame at an early age.” The bare-bones delivery with minimal instrumentation creates an environment of vulnerability and opening up — the listener gets the sense that this is not a gimmick, but a declaration of Bieber’s true feelings. It’s a reminder that, despite being the “Prince Joffrey of Pop,” he’s still human.",0

He was in the last stretch of a colossal world tour to support his colossal fourth album, Purpose, and he simply couldn’t do it anymore. With 150 shows across 40 countries completed — a grueling run that lasted 16 months — Bieber had only 14 shows to go, but he was done. He offered a brief apology, and a vague note from Scooter Braun, his manager, filled in the rest of the blanks. “A man’s soul and well-being I truly care about came first and We must all respect and honor that,” Braun wrote on Instagram. That was the end of the tour. More than a year before that — only months into the start of the tour — a New York Times review noted that Bieber seemed so checked out during the show, you’d think you were watching a “suspected kidnapping in progress, subject forced into high-intensity labor.” Fourteen more months of that life couldn’t have helped. So Bieber walked away. Sure, he popped up on a guest feature here and there (and, yes, the songs charted, because come on, it’s Bieber), but for all intents and purposes he was out. He got married. He grew a mustache. He got rid of his mustache. He grew it again. He seemed content to coast on his fame and the sporadic feature spot. For three years, he didn’t tour. When he came back with a new album — 2020’s Changes, his first in five years — it seemed like he’d correctly ejected from the mega pop machine and landed safely somewhere he preferred to be. Changes sees Bieber at his most coherent — he is fully comfortable in R&Bieber mode, his voice sounds as silky and effervescent as ever, his vocal runs confident and joyous. It was a grown album, with no radio-targeted missiles but steady bops. It was less of a play for commercial dominance, more of just… a vibe. The singles did fine, but nowhere near the stratospheric successes of “Sorry” and Purpose’s other offerings. And he didn’t seem to care much! Pop stardom be damned, it seemed like he was having fun. With Changes, we also got insight into what drove him to leave. The album rollout included a ten-part (I know) YouTube documentary series, during which Bieber reveals how dark things got on tour: “Bro, I was like, dying. My security and stuff were coming into the room at night to check my pulse. Like, people don’t know how serious it got.” Though Bieber produced the series, it held together as an intimate and honest look at his darkest moments. His doctors make appearances. The message was not exactly subtle: The frenzied levels of fame during Purpose were not working for Bieber, and he needed to abdicate his King of Pop throne for his own wellbeing. If fame was the condition, and Changes was the prescription, it’s puzzling, then, to see Bieber pick up sonically where Purpose left off. His sixth album, Justice, arrived last week. It’s an eclectic range of the reigning pop modes — vaguely EDM hooks, acoustic soul, soft ballads, and yes, R&B-infused jams — tied together by consistent big choruses and bright production (and vexing cameos from Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.). It’s an inconsistent album with transcendent highs and tolerable lows. Plenty of songs on it will dominate the charts and the radio. But is this what Bieber wants?",0

Skrillex, who produced the infectious Purpose hits “Sorry” and “Where Are U Now?,” is on deck again with the album’s soft piano opener “2Much” and the cinematic “Somebody.” The Monsterz & Strangers collective, who featured heavily in Dua Lipa’s Future Nostalgia last year, were involved in four songs, including the anthemic “Anyone,” with a chorus built for an arena near you. And Andrew Watt and Louis Bell, essential ingredients in the secret sauce of Post Malone’s hitmaking consistency, are all over Justice, infusing songs like “Deserve You” with Post’s bouncy, hazy bop aura. One person missing from Justice is Poo Bear, one of Bieber’s longtime collaborators and an established R&B hitmaker who’s worked with the likes of Usher and Chris Brown (and gave us 112’s “Peaches and Cream” — thank you, Poo Bear, we will never forget). Poo Bear has featured on every Bieber album since 2013’s Journals, but is notably absent here. On Justice’s predecessor, Changes, Poo Bear had writing and producing credits on every song.",0

This is a competitive album. He is throwing his hat in the ring. The producers and writers enlisted signal that this record is meant to put up a fight against singles from Post Malone and Dua Lipa and co. It’s an album that has its eyes firmly set on the zeitgeist. You hear this on songs like “Die for You,” an ’80s-sounding synthy romp that is musically in conversation with the Weeknd’s latest offerings. The roster of guest stars, too, feel curated intentionally to hit every angle of the pop spectrum — the Kid LAROI, a rapper/singer/TikTok sensation once mentored by Juice WRLD, lends a hand on “Unstable” and Afrobeats star Burna Boy joins on “Loved by You,” while noted fellow Wife Guy Chance the Rapper guests on “Holy” and Khalid croons on “As I Am.” Justice steadfastly refuses to pick a lane, opting instead to launch an all-out assault on every existing pop aesthetic. The clearest signal of the album’s ambitions do not come in the music, though — it’s in the album’s positioning. It is mystifying that the first voice you hear on the album is not Bieber’s but that of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The first track opens with Dr. King’s now-familiar declaration “Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.” And, look, this is definitely true, but it has absolutely nothing to do with the song that follows, about how much Bieber loves his wife. This remains true when we arrive at the midway point and MLK pops up again, on “MLK Interlude,” a 100-second snippet of a speech about standing up for justice regardless of what it costs you, followed by another song about how much Bieber loves his wife. To say the justice theme on Justice is thin is to give it too much credit. It simply does not pop up anywhere else. It feels like a forced fit, a graceless attempt to inject the album into pertinent social justice conversations that are unfolding, but comes off like a Black Lives Matter statement by Gushers: “Justice” was less a framing device on the album, more of a hollow attempt to land a news cycle or two. It is hard to imagine Bieber insisting on positioning the album like this. I am not privy to the Bieber Machine marketing meetings, so this is mere speculation, but it’s difficult to conjure up an image of Bieber turning to an associate and saying, “Can we get MLK on this joint?” The gesture is a metaphor, just not for what Bieber and co. thought. It only serves to highlight how vague Justice is — musically, commercially, socially, it’s just all so centerless.",0

It’s breezy and fun and unencumbered, and destined to become the song of the summer. You get deeper insight into how extremely his shit the song is (and, worth noting, also extremely my shit) watching him perform a slowed-down version of “Peaches” in an NPR Tiny Desk Concert. This is Bieber in his element, and it is a treat. Bieber is gifted with a stunning voice and a command of the fundamentals of R&B. He is at his least convincing when he’s playing megastar/pop king, but he sounds most confident and comfortable in the intimacy of R&B. When the album charts are updated, Justice will likely be his eighth No. 1 album. As his label and his management celebrate this incredible accomplishment (and they should), it might not occur to anyone in the room if this current offering neuters the star’s obvious musical superpowers or restrains his dreams. It might not occur to anyone to let Bieber sing his little songs and do his little vocal runs and then go home and be the Wife Guy that he is. It might not occur to anyone that there are dangers associated with ascending the pop mountain again. If it does occur to them, the thought might be brief and fleeting, drowned out by the soft purr of the pop machine.●",0

He continued his first album with the release of “My World 2.0,” was named Best New Artist by the MTV Video Music Awards, took away four honors from the American Music Awards and was nominated for Best New Artist at the Grammy Awards.",0

He talks about God and faith and castles in Ireland, about shame and drugs and marriage. He talks about what it is to feel empty inside, and what it is to feel full. At one point he says, “I’m going to wrap it up here,” but he doesn’t, he just keeps going, and that is what it is like to talk to Justin Bieber now. Like you’re in the confessional booth with him. Like whatever rules about “privacy” or the thick opaque wall of massive celebrity that people like Bieber are supposed to follow don’t apply. Justin Bieber covers the May 2021 issue of GQ. Secure your own copy here. Jumpsuit, $4,200, by Dior Men. Ring, his own. He has lived a well-documented life—maybe among the more well-documented lives in the history of this decaying planet. But to my knowledge, there is not one example of him speaking this way—in a moving but unprompted, unselfconscious torrent of words—in public prior to this moment. I will admit to being disoriented. If I’m being honest, I had been expecting someone else entirely—someone more monosyllabic; someone more distracted, more unhappy; someone more like the guy I’m pretty sure Justin Bieber was not all that long ago—and now I am so thrown that the best I can do is stammer out some tortured version of… How did you become this person? By which I mean: seemingly guileless. Bursting with the desire to connect, to tell his own story, in case it might be of use to anyone else. It’s a question that’s not even a question, really. But what Bieber gently says in response is: “That’s okay.” He knows approximately what I’m asking—how he got from wherever he was to here, to becoming the man in front of me, clear-eyed on a computer screen from an undisclosed location in Los Angeles. His hair, under a Vetements hat, is long in the back; he is in no particular hurry. He is married to a woman—Hailey Baldwin Bieber—who cares for him like no one has ever cared for him, he says. He is happy. He is currently renovating the house in which he will live happily with his wife. He’s spent the past several months piecing together a new record, Justice, which is dense with love songs and ’80s-style anthems—interspersed with some well-intentioned, if not totally well-advised, interludes featuring the voice of Martin Luther King Jr.—that are bluntly honest about his bad past and equally optimistic about his future. (“Everybody saw me sick, and it felt like no one gave a shit,” he sings on the cathartic last song on the record, “Lonely.”) He’s still so overflowing with music that he puts out Freedom, a meditative, postscript of an EP about faith, just a few weeks after Justice. He is, if anything, the empathetic professional in this interaction too as he goes about trying to help me understand how he’s arrived at where he’s arrived.",0

But today, he says, he thinks of himself as a comforter, in part because he knows what it is to have been the person who needed comfort so badly. He asks himself now: How can I be of service? The new music, the inspirational messages he posts on Instagram, the deliberately calm manner in which he goes about his days—all of it is addressed in some ways to his younger self, to the kid who was drowning and felt like he’d never be saved. Justin Bieber wants to save that kid now. He wants to talk to him. He wants to tell him not all is lost. Jeans, $198, by Levi’s Authorized Vintage. His own underwear by Calvin Klein Underwear.

But I’m just like: ‘I did a bunch of stupid shit. That’s okay. I’m still available. I’m still available to help. And I’m still worthy of helping.’ ” To gain access to him during a pandemic, one must first get through his private medical team. A nurse is on call at the house and at the studio. Collaborators, friends, managers, producers, songwriters, engineers, all the disparate people one needs to gather together to again commence the work of being Justin Bieber—all are administered one rapid test and one PCR. “There’s so many different tests,” Bieber says. “They get kinda weird, but it’s important for us, since we’re operating on such a big level, with so many people, that we keep everyone safe.” Bieber and Hailey spent the first three or four months of the pandemic in Canada, where he was born, and then they came back to Los Angeles and they’ve been here ever since. He is 27, and this interlude at home represents probably the longest time he’s spent in one place since his childhood. “I’ve been moving since I was like 15 or 16,” he says.",0

We are particularly familiar with what happened to Bieber himself—the litany of distasteful and sometimes dangerous stuff he did that he won’t defend, the equally unkind things people said about him as he did that stuff, etc. But I will share a personal view: Being famous breaks something in your brain. Especially when your fame comes as a result of your talent, from the thing you’ve loved and nurtured and worked at since you were young. Bieber earned his success while he was still a child; then his gift turned into a snake and bit him. How do you become a good or well-adjusted or normal person when you don’t have access to a single normal thing in your entire life? You can’t. You don’t. “You wake up one day and…you’re unhappy and you have all this success in the world, but you’re just like: Well, what is this worth if I’m still feeling empty inside?” And while maybe you don’t care if Justin Bieber ever does make his way back to a kind of normalcy, perhaps you can admit there is at least something admirable, in the abstract, about someone finding a way to survive, and even to become kind, when all they’ve been taught since a young age, by millions of adoring people, is that there is no need for them to be kind at all. And if that doesn’t move you, then maybe you can at least find sociological interest in the process that Bieber is about to recount here, which is how you turn into someone you don’t want to be, and what you do about it once you decide you want to be someone else. Someone better, even. Sorry about the aside. Anyway… If you ask Bieber what he would’ve been doing five years ago, should the world have shut down and locked him in his home, he will say that five years ago things were pretty dark in general. “I was surrounded by a lot of people, and we were all kind of just escaping our real life,” Bieber says. “I think we just weren’t living in reality.” Which is to say: “I think it would have probably resulted in just a lot of doing drugs and being posted up, to be honest.” Cardigan and pants (prices upon request) by Louis Vuitton Men’s.

The people around you understand how things work, so they’re the ones putting things together.” And though Bieber is now sure enough about what he wants that he finished most of the vocals for Justice in less than 45 minutes per song, Gudwin says, things were different when he was younger. Ryan Good, one of Bieber’s oldest friends, remembers Bieber struggling. “He was disappointed with himself,” Good says. “Most people would numb themselves to that. And I think he probably went through that stage, like, ‘I’m so disappointed in myself, I don’t want to feel like this anymore. I don’t want to feel disappointed in myself anymore.’ And at a certain point, I think he got to the point where he was like, ‘No, I want to live my life and not be numb. And so I’m going to work on it. I’m going to be who I know I am.’ ” What had all of it been for? Singing, Bieber says, “was supposed to bring such joy. Like, this is what I feel called to do. And my purpose in my life. I know that when I open my mouth, people love to hear me sing. I literally started singing on the streets and crowds would form around me to where I’m like, Okay, this could be something. There’s this reciprocation of: I’m using my gifts to serve people. That’s what I loved so much. And I just think more and more as you’re a kid and you don’t have an identity yet, and you’re trying to figure out who you are, and to have everyone saying how good you are, how incredible you are? You just start to believe that stuff. And ego sets in. And then that’s where insecurities come in. And then you start treating people a certain way and feeling superior and above people. And then there’s this whole dynamic shift. I just woke up one day and I’m just like, Who am I? I didn’t know. And that was scary to me.”",0

Now, with his marriage to Hailey, he says, “we’re just creating these moments for us as a couple, as a family, that we’re building these memories. And it’s beautiful that we have that to look forward to. Before, I didn’t have that to look forward to in my life. My home life was unstable. Like, my home life was not existing. I didn’t have a significant other. I didn’t have someone to love. I didn’t have someone to pour into. But now I have that.” And then there is God. If you ask Chance the Rapper why he and his friend seem so happy in an industry that tends to grind people to dust, he will answer without hesitation. “Both of us, our secret sauce is Jesus,” Chance says. “Justin doesn’t fake the funk. He goes to Jesus with his problems, he goes to Jesus with his successes. He calls me just to talk about Jesus.” “Justin is blessed. There are people that are blessed that don’t have anything, but you can feel it off them. It’s like an aura, to be touched by God.” It is beautiful to hear Justin Bieber talk about God. “He is grace,” he says. “Every time we mess up, He’s picking us back up every single time. That’s how I view it. And so it’s like, ‘I made a mistake. I won’t dwell in it. I don’t sit in shame. But it actually makes me want to do better.’ ” (And perhaps this is convenient: Bieber has done a lot in his life that needs forgiving, and an ethos of total acceptance can be alarmingly close to an ethos of total impunity, of being right in your deeds, no matter how bad or dark or selfish they are. But hear him out.) I am not a believer myself. Bieber doesn’t care about this. “My goal isn’t to try and persuade anybody to believe in what I believe or condemn anybody for not believing what I believe,” he says. “If it can help someone, great. If someone’s like, ‘Hey, I don’t believe that. I don’t think that’s true,’ by all means, that’s their prerogative.” Bieber has been around different churches—he is a former attendee of Hillsong, the church once closely associated with the now disgraced pastor Carl Lentz, who was fired for “moral failures” last year. Bieber doesn’t mention Lentz by name, or even indirectly, but he says he has seen firsthand how faith, in its various institutional forms, can morph into just another kind of celebrity worship. “I think so many pastors put themselves on this pedestal,” he says. “And it’s basically, church can be surrounded around the man, the pastor, the guy, and it’s like, ‘This guy has this ultimate relationship with God that we all want but we can’t get because we’re not this guy.’ That’s not the reality, though. The reality is, every human being has the same access to God.”",0

Who am I to be able to do this? Because look what I’ve done. Look at my past.’ And that was me for a long time. And I always felt like I was a good encourager. I always felt like I could encourage people and that my words held weight. But when you start living in shame, you start to devalue what shouldn’t have lost that value. And that’s why…” He puts his head down and is silent. For 20, 30 long seconds, he says nothing. I can’t even see his face. And then he picks his head up and continues, and his voice is thick and choked. “It’s just rewarding to be all that you were designed to be. And I believe that, at this point in my life, I’m right where I’m supposed to be, doing what I believe that God wants me to do. And there’s nothing more fulfilling.” Can I ask what you were thinking about just now, in that pause? “Yeah. Uh. I just got, I just got kind of emotional because, you know, even this interview, it’s like: It matters. You had this desire in your heart to do what you’re doing, and you’re doing it. And now I am sharing what I believe God put in my heart and you are asking the questions in your brain, getting this out of me, and it’s beautiful. You’re like me. We’re all miracles, really.” His voice is as quiet as it’s been the entire time we’ve spoken. But, as he does these days, he keeps going. “You know, the fact that you are here and you made it through all the stuff that you’ve been through, you know—just because you weren’t in my position, I mean, I don’t know your story. I don’t know where you come from. I don’t know your history. I don’t know what you’ve been through. But I know you haven’t had it all peaches and cream, you know? Like some shit has probably made you not want to do things at times and not let your guard down and not do what you feel led and called to do. But you are here. And that’s a miracle.” Bieber wants to tell you that you’re a miracle too. He asks himself: “What can I do to be an encouragement?” He wants to say: “You can do it. You are valuable. Whatever you are saying about yourself or believing about yourself is not necessarily true. It’s just not.” “I don’t know if that gives you clarity,” Bieber says, out of words at last. He is trying to be less focused on the outcomes of things. So either way, ultimately, is fine. He grins. “This is just therapy for me.” A version of this story originally appeared in the May 2021 issue with the title ""Amazing Grace."" Secure your copy of the Justin Bieber issue.

 * He has an intensely loyal fan base. Justin Bieber has experienced a lot of negative publicity through the years, partly due to general haterism and also due to some bad behavior on his own part (which I would argue isn’t inconsistent with most men in their late teens / early twenties). Yet he has continued to endure and his fans have followed along. A big part of the reason for their loyalty is that Bieber experienced so much ridicule in his younger years for things like his haistyle, small size and adolescent voice that they are used to ignoring negativity directed his way. There’s a reason why his fan base became known as the Beliebers; they really believe in him. Similarly, Bieber himself isn’t bothered by the negative pub because…
 * He really doesn’t take himself too seriously. A lot of haters thought that if they said enough bad stuff about him that they would break him. So they insulted his music, his hair, his voice, his fan base, etc. But he just laughs this stuff off. He laughs off his public gaffes and blunders. He’s willing to get on Saturday Night Live and mock his own image. He’s willing to do a Super Bowl ad for T-Mobile where he dances like a goofball, despite the fact that he can dance significantly better than that. He’s willing to do a silly skit with Drake before the Juno Awards. He is willing to spoof himself in a death scene in Zoolander 2. He does all this stuff because he can laugh at himself. This is important for career longevity, especially in the age of social media where the trolls try their hardest to crush the talented, and they occasionally succeed. Justin Bieber is way above that stuff.",0

 * He works with all the right people. Among singers, rappers, producers and songwriters, Justin Bieber has always worked with the biggest names in a wide variety of genres. Drake, Nicki Minaj, Diplo, Skrillex, Ed Sheeran, DJ Snake, Ludacris, Big Sean, will.i.am., Chris Brown… the list goes on. And he doesn’t just work with the established musicians; sometimes he works with the right up-and-comers. For example, Chance the Rapper emerged as a major rising star in 2016, but Bieber worked with him three years prior on a song . Working with the right people, whether as a featured performer or just singing the verse on a song, is essential for a long career because he stays in-demand and relevant even when he has no solo projects. Also, because Bieber works with a wide variety of musicians, he can leverage his fame into other genres. His name is well known around EDM, R&B, hip hop, and other genres outside of pop.",0

Justin Bieber was discovered through YouTube and that guy became famous at a very early age.

He is often seen to be rude with his fans, letting them down very frequently and getting into major fights with his co-workers and yes, the paparazzi. I personally think that he took the attention that he got from being in an on and off flingy relationship with Selena Gomez as an opportunity to rise higher in the industry with controversies .

Yes, he had a bunch of run-ins with the law (and 2014 was especially a bummer), but I think that he’s getting back on his feet and improving himself. He apologized for the misdeeds he did in the past years, and he is trying to move forward with his career in a positive way, amid the negativity he has gained.",1

He has built a career as a titan in pop music who is able and willing to change with the times. His career thus far has experienced at least three different phases, and with each phase he has been relevant or even ahead of the curve in terms of emerging styles. As a result, his fan base is growing. People like that don’t just disappear: they usually manage to have long careers.",1

When he first broke onto the scene around 2010, he was a teenager who looked younger than his age, had a prepubescent voice and had a fan base that primarily consisted of preteen girls. By all means, his career should have dead-ended there because the teenybopper stars seldom carry over their success. Instead, he had a graceful physical maturation and he was able to convincingly shift from making kiddie music to making pop music that appeals to a general audience. The jump from kid star to adult star is rough, but the few people who manage to do it - like Justin Timberlake, Beyonce, Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera - are usually enduring entertainers.",1

Usher began his career in his early teens and became one of the biggest pop stars in the world as an adult. But at one point in his mid-teens, Usher lost his voice because he went through puberty and his voice changed. Many executives at his record label thought his career was over because they feared he would no longer be able to sing. But through patience and perseverence, he was able to find his voice right before his debut album. If you listen to Bieber’s voice on his three main albums - My World, Believe and Purpose - it has been different on each one and he has undergone a significant physical transformation. That’s a tough transition, but it’s much easier when your mentor is one of the biggest stars on the planet and he experienced the same thing.",1

Many people think he’s just a blah singer with a pretty face. Not true. He can play multiple instruments including guitar, trumpet, piano and drums (he’s a very good drummer). As a vocalist, he has continued to expand his repertoire. He can also dance extremely well. As a live performer, he knows how to engage his audience. None of these things happened by accident.

To be honest, the combination of instruments just sounds very vampire-y, but I actually quite like it (when I’m ignoring how dark the lyrics are).

This has my favourite use of instruments by far: the drums, guitar and strings (combined with the lyrics) come together to make a song that feels super dramatic, but in the best way possible.

1407293291922702344,I can’t even put in to words how much I hate Avril Lavigne and her oversized fangs,"Avril Lavigne has two kinds of fans. The fans that stopped listening to her after Girlfriend, the chart-topping single of her third, 2007 album The Best Damn Thing, and the fans that found her at Girlfriend.The former, the purists, believe she sold out. Some of them, who have spent the last 12 years knee-deep in Reddit conspiracy theory threads, even think Avril died and was replaced by a doppelganger.The others, now in their mid 20s and eagerly awaiting Avril's first new album in six years (Head Above Water), are a rare breed. Together, they form one of the most curious fan bases of any mainstream musician of the last two decades.But then again, Avril is a curious star.Original fans grew up on moody, punk Avril, whose only accessory was a school tie around her neck, her mouse brown hair like curtains across bright blue eyes that swam in layers of smudged kohl, her nails black and chipped.Tenacious, rebellious, but ultimately (by her own admission) not a real punk, Avril, discovered at 15 singing country songs in a bookshop in Canada’s rural Napanee, appealed by way of alternative accessibility. She had an edge (and once kicked a girl in a bar for calling her a poseur), but parents would still wrap up her albums for Christmas.With her Grammy nominated-debut album Let Go in 2002, which sold 40 million records worldwide, followed by a number one charting sophomore album Under My Skin in 2004, Avril united rival superfans of Panic at the Disco and Fall Out Boy; satisfied the musically uneducated lamely wielding Walkmans and the sound snobs flaunting tiny MP3s; spoke to both emos and preps; rock chicks and skater boys.Yet with The Best Damn Thing, 23-year-old Avril’s music began to mutate. As did her appearance. Her poker-straight-hair, bleached peroxide a couple of years before, was suddenly worn in loose, soft princess curls. Her black jeans and T Shirt were swapped for heels and poofy, strapless dresses. Her makeup, no longer a scribbled afterthought, became a “look”.While the album was a commercial success, the sound divided opinion. It was her first album for new label RCA, co-written and produced by Swedish pop maestro Doctor Luke, and, to borrow teen Avril terminology, it sucked.While some songs, such as Everything Back From You, were reassuringly Avril, playfully amping up the puerile teen angst with lyrics like “today was the worst day; I went through hell” against quirky, carefree choruses, others were unrecognisably cheesy. I Don’t Have To Try’s banal song-rap was reminiscent of a teen band performing at their school prom.The album single Girlfriend, shouty, sugary and delivered Hey Mickey-style, sounded almost sacrilegious to listeners whose souls had fed off Lavigne’s trademark melancholia, her delicate voice almost breaking over lyrics of heartbreak before working itself into self-assured rage for the chorus; each song a personal motivational anthem, each melody sticking with you for years. But Girlfriend just felt like chart fodder. In fact it became Avril Lavigne's first, and only song to make the US charts.While many fans welcomed Avril’s new mood – of course artists should be free to evolve, musically and personally – others were nonplussed. In fact, they couldn’t believe it was the same person. She was wearing pink, for God’s sake! The corners of her eyes looked different. Her smile was off. Her pitch was higher. In one video, Hello Kitty, a playful yet controversial ode to the Japanese cartoon, fans expressed their disbelief in the comments. “Is this really Avril?”Two more albums followed: Goodbye Lullaby in 2011 and Avril Lavigne in 2013. Both lagged in the charts, only making top 10 in 12 countries. Avril Lavigne received the lowest first week sales of her career: 44,000 copies. Critics felt Avril’s rebelliousness, with songs like Here’s To Never Growing Up – delivered in her new blend of banal, cheery pop-rock – was laboured. After all, she was a 26 year old woman. How necessary is rebellion when you’re an adult?Then along came the conspiracy theorists. Originating on a blog site in Brazil called Avril Esta Morta (Avril is Dead) a theory was spawned that Avril had died and been replaced by a lookalike actress named Melissa Vendella. It went viral (thanks to a Buzzfeed journalist who picked up on the story) and transmuted.Depending on which dark corner of the internet you passed through, Avril had died in a snowboarding accident, had taken her own life after her grandfather died in 2003, or, having simply been unable to cope with fame, begun to use a body double in certain situations. But then she had died, and the doppelganger (hired by the label) continued her work to distract the paparazzi.The Brazilian blogger later admitted the post was a hoax. She wanted to make a point about how conspiracy theories spread like wildfire. About how the internet would believe anything. Melissa Vandella is a made up name. But it was too late: the theory took on a life of its own, fuelled by the fact Avril had gone quiet. She was absent on social media, wasn’t producing any music, and her name only made headlines for, almost unbelievably, charging Brazilian fans up to $400 each to take a photo with her in 2014. Fans blamed Melissa.Eventually in an exclusive 2015 interview with People Magazine, Avril, freshly divorced from Nickelback frontman Chad Kroeger – her second marriage, following her fleeting union with Deryck Whibley of Sum4 at and 21 – revealed she’d spent the last two years in bed battling Lyme disease. The illness is spread by ticks and attacks your immune system, causing chronic fatigue. In the interview, Avril said she’d almost died. For some fans, this was more than coincidence.Four years later, and Avril is finally releasing her first album in seven years: Head Above Water. Last month, she released a statement, which has done nothing to quiet the twittering Reddit threads sharing fresh hypotheses by the day, explaining that the music was a reflection on her illness. “One night, I thought I was dying, and I had accepted that I was going to die,” she wrote. “My mom laid with me in bed and held me. I felt like I was drowning…In that moment, the songwriting of this album began...This album tells my story.”But who wants to hear this story? Who are the Avril Lavigne ""Stans"" of 2019? The very idea of an Avril Lavigne superfan seems absurd. Picture it: a 26-year-old, done with their city job at 7pm, sitting on the bus with their earbuds in, mouthing Complicated’s “Chill out, it’s all been done before” as they look pensively out of the window, metaphorical black tears rolling down their cheeks as they sit on their hands to stop the compulsion to strum an air guitar.And yet, they exist. On Avril’s Instagram, where she is followed by 21 million people, comments fizz with excitement at the new album, with followers signing off as “Little Black Stars” in reference to Avril’s song Black Star and her various star tattoos. Most of these fans are European or South American, and in their mid twenties.Danny, a 29-year-old advertising designer from Costa Rica, and Luca, a 30-year-old hairdresser from Italy, both discovered Avril in 2002, age 12 and 9 respectively. “I loved her carefree, rebellious teenager attitude,” Dan tells me over email. “Avril was the anti-fashion girl to the pop singers at the time. That’s what I fell in love with.” Danny has listened to Avril every day since, and, despite enjoying other indie music, has not found another artist on her level. Kamila, on the other hand, admits she only listens to her new music out of habit, alongside Taylor Swift, Maroon 5, Green Day and The Killers. A 25-year-old radio journalist from Moscow, she first discovered Avril in 2004. “She has changed, but I’ll listen to her anyway. Her fanbase changed a lot in 2007. Many didn’t like the new transformation.”Danny has no problem with it. “She has matured as an artist and as a woman with each album, but she maintains her sound’s youthful essence,” he says. “With Head Above Water, Avril wanted her voice to be the main instrument. The maturity in her lyrics captivated me instantly.” Did he ever buy into the “Melissa” rumours? “Absolutely not. It isn’t logical. She has physically changed, as anyone would in 17 years. She’s no longer a girl; she’s a woman. People who make fun about these rumors are people who do not accept that we all change and mature with the passage of time or who believe that an artist must remain stuck in a musical style.” Would he count himself as a “stan?” “Absolutely, although it’s clear she no longer has the number of fans she once had.”It’s particularly clear from the Spotify statistics. While Complicated has 207 million streams, Girlfriend has less than half. Her two new album singles – both ballads – Head Above Water and Tell Me It’s Over have just 62 million and six million respectively. Her monthly listens tally close to ten million (mostly from Sao Palo and Mexico City). It’s only two million less than Britney Spears, but then again, in 2019, you’re more likely to come across a Britney meme, or a line about her 2007 meltdown on a mug in the office, than one of her songs.Avril’s third single from the album, Dumb Blonde, was released Tuesday and, in a collaboration surely no fan saw coming, features Nicki Minaj. The song is closer to “old Avril” than both her new singles, its poppy song rap and catchy melody heavily reminiscent of Girlfriend (admittedly still a departure from her original sound).Listen to the lyrics – simple, playful, defiant – and at times, you can picture the singer in her heyday, her baseball cap turned sideways, wheeling up on her bike through the mall, that red and black school tie slung loosely around her neck. Nostalgia briefly sweetens the moment, and then we cringe. We put the moment back in the box, where it belongs.It's Avril Lavigne very own Catch 22: fans never wanted Avril to grow up, and yet, they outgrew her long ago",0

She was 29. A year later, she started feeling inexplicably exhausted. Doctors tried to diagnose her with anxiety and chronic fatigue, even though she was sure she had Lyme disease. Finally, she got a vindicating diagnosis and spent two years in bed on antibiotics, certain, at one point, that she would die.",0

Lavigne, now 34, doesn’t want to talk about that. “It was a relief” to get the diagnosis, she says tersely, calling from Los Angeles. “I was like: ‘OK, now I can at least start treating something.’” She was treated at home. Who cared for her? Her manager interrupts and insists we “really focus on the music”. But it is hard to separate Lavigne’s illness from her sixth album, Head Above Water, named after a song that came to her as she lay in her mother’s arms, feeling as if she was drowning. It is her best song in years, an emphatic, gothic ballad that is doing well on the US Christian singles chart and has 57m YouTube views. “It just felt really good to be singing,” she says. “The emotion was so raw.”",0
1407293291922702344,I can’t even put in to words how much I hate Avril Lavigne and her oversized fangs,"Despite Lavigne’s illness, she says she never doubted her capacity to commit to a whole album. She started writing on guitar in bed, graduating to piano when she felt stronger. Inner strength is the prevailing theme of the eight songs I heard, which often evoke Lana Del Rey’s moody epics. Empowerment anthems like this were everywhere a few years ago, but have been replaced by stark admissions of vulnerability and nihilism. But keeping pace with pop wasn’t Lavigne’s concern. “I didn’t want to do what everyone was doing,” she says, mentioning a need for “organic musical realness” and constructing songs around her vocals “versus building this crazy loud track and just burying a vocal in it”. This is the kind of dry “focus on the music” Lavigne prefers. She keeps saying how “meaningful” the music is, but won’t go deeper.",0
1407293291922702344,I can’t even put in to words how much I hate Avril Lavigne and her oversized fangs,"Other songs allude to a toxic relationship. All Lavigne will say is that my assumption is “obviously” correct and that they’re categorically not about her second ex-husband, Nickelback frontman Chad Kroeger; they have a “great relationship” (he worked on the album). “I appreciate you trying to really get the juice,” she says mockingly, “but I’m not gonna go there.” I explain that I’m not looking for gossip, but context for her most personal album. “That’s the thing about my music,” she says, exasperated. “I write it and I put it out there, and people can interpret it the way they like.” It is hard to talk about the music when the music apparently speaks for itself.",0
1407293291922702344,I can’t even put in to words how much I hate Avril Lavigne and her oversized fangs,"But maybe never showing vulnerability is key to Lavigne’s 17-year pop career. She has heartfelt songs – her debut album’s I’m With You is a fantastic pop-rock ballad, later sampled by Rihanna – but her exterior has swung between feckless (giving the finger on MTV’s era-defining Total Request Live in 2004) and brittle. (She regrets the tearful 2015 television interview announcing her illness.) She is publicly close to both her ex-husbands, Kroeger and Sum 41 frontman Deryck Whibley, whom she met aged 17, married at 21 and divorced at 25.",0
1407293291922702344,I can’t even put in to words how much I hate Avril Lavigne and her oversized fangs,"Pop is built on female resilience, which seems to have come naturally to her. When asked whether sexist and derisory criticism affected her as a teenager, she is unimpressed: “I don’t know what you’re referring to.” The stories she told about Limp Bizkit’s Fred Durst trying to sleep with her; the manufactured feud between her and Britney Spears? “Oh, that’s OK,” she says, flippantly. “It’s just because I was superpowerful and they needed gossip to talk about.” Her debut sold more than 6m copies in a year and she toured the world. Did she always feel protected as a teenage girl in a cutthroat industry? “It was a whirlwind, and it was so magical and unbelievable.” The only gruelling parts were the “different time zones and travelling”.",0
1407293291922702344,I can’t even put in to words how much I hate Avril Lavigne and her oversized fangs,"What seemed less natural as her career progressed was Lavigne’s actual identity. The driven 15-year-old from smalltown Napanee, Ontario, was discovered singing country songs in a bookshop. A year later, she moved to New York with her older brother after a Canadian label sent footage of her singing karaoke to a producer. Two months after turning 17, she was signed by pop impresario LA Reid. In Lavigne’s telling, Arista thought they had a Sheryl Crow-style country act on their hands, but she wanted to write heavier songs. A compromise was reached: after writing rockier material with one co-writer, she was paired with LA trio the Matrix, who wrote Let Go’s three massive singles, Complicated, Sk8er Boi and I’m With You. Lavigne and Matrix disagree about the level of her input on the album. Reid maintained “whatever gets the job done” diplomacy.",0
1407293291922702344,I can’t even put in to words how much I hate Avril Lavigne and her oversized fangs,"The first album was so successful that Lavigne says she only had six months to write 2004’s Under My Skin: “They made me put it out before I was ready.” She and co-writer Butch Walker kept writing until the last minute, producing the bittersweet grunge anthem My Happy Ending. “I called them and I said: ‘Guys, I have the first single.’ They’re like: ‘No, we’re going with Don’t Tell Me.’” Arista led with their choice but Lavigne was right: My Happy Ending peaked higher and sold almost three times as many copies.",0
1407293291922702344,I can’t even put in to words how much I hate Avril Lavigne and her oversized fangs,"The brooding Under My Skin reflected the kind of progression that makes sense, especially for a pop star who stressed her autonomy at a time when girls weren’t afforded much of it. Which is why her third album, The Best Damn Thing, seemed so odd. Her first for a new label, RCA, it was a riotous pop record led by the deadpan cheerleader banger Girlfriend, her only US No 1 single to date.",0
1407293291922702344,I can’t even put in to words how much I hate Avril Lavigne and her oversized fangs,"Like Gwen Stefani, Lavigne has always been conservative despite her punk image. Her family are devoutly Christian. She once described girls “having sex with a ton of boys” as “a bad thing”, a belief that informed Don’t Tell Me: “Did I not tell you that I’m not like that girl, the one who gives it all away?” By the time she released The Best Damn Thing, the Disney-pushed purity-ring craze dominated pop. But even that couldn’t explain the album’s regressive lyrics: “You left without me and now you’re somewhere out there with a bitch, slut, psycho babe,” she sang on Everything Back But You. On the title track, she moaned about how she hated it when a guy “doesn’t get the door”, “doesn’t get the tab”, “doesn’t understand why a certain time of the month I don’t wanna hold his hand”.",0
1407293291922702344,I can’t even put in to words how much I hate Avril Lavigne and her oversized fangs,"In retrospect, it would be a relief to blame the album on its producer and co-writer, Dr Luke, who made his name creating debauched hits for the era’s female icons, and lost favour after former protegee Kesha accused him of abuse. (He denies all claims and is suing for defamation.) But Lavigne enjoyed working with him: “We wrote really great songs together.” These three albums were the only records – until now – where she didn’t have to compromise. “It was the fourth album when the tears started,” she says.",0
1407293291922702344,I can’t even put in to words how much I hate Avril Lavigne and her oversized fangs,"“The majority of the time in my career, [RCA] want me to write another Girlfriend. They don’t want the ballads.” It seems especially tragic that on 2011’s otherwise lovelorn Goodbye Lullaby – written following her split from Whibley, although he produced half of it – she had to include What the Hell, a song about snogging a guy’s friends and going “on a million dates” that sounded unfortunately similar to the then ubiquitous Disney pop-rock she had inspired.",0
1407293291922702344,I can’t even put in to words how much I hate Avril Lavigne and her oversized fangs,"“It’s difficult to be a woman and to be heard, and people sometimes don’t take you seriously,” she says, finally warming to a subject. “I’m highly intuitive and I’ve always got a very strong gut feeling. I’ve always felt that I’ve known what’s best for me to do and I’ve had to fight different people on this journey over those 17 years: ‘You need to do this and it needs to go Top 40.’ You make those songs cos you have to, but then the stuff that’s the best on record is the album tracks.”",0
1407293291922702344,I can’t even put in to words how much I hate Avril Lavigne and her oversized fangs,"It sounds miserable. “I would get some songs the style I really wanted,” she says. “I always loved the pop-rock thing and it’s still who I am. I’m still proud of those songs and I wrote them. It wasn’t like people wrote them and gave it to me. It was like: ‘OK, I get it. You guys want singles that are going in this direction. Fine, I’ll work with you but I’d rather be doing something else.’ You can’t be stubborn and just do everything your own way.”",0
1407293291922702344,I can’t even put in to words how much I hate Avril Lavigne and her oversized fangs,"If commercially inclined compromise is one of the secrets of Lavigne’s enduring career, it remains at odds with the delinquent attitude of many of her songs. That was the mood on her 2013 self-titled album, which dwelled on teenage rebellion and contained a J-pop-influenced song about Hello Kitty that many deemed racist on seeing its stereotype-laden video. (She denied the suggestion, citing the Japanese production crew.) Claims of cultural appropriation aside, its lyrics fared little better. Referencing Spin the Bottle and “roll[ing] around in our underwear”, it sounded like a middle-aged pervert’s idea of teenage sleepovers.",0
1407293291922702344,I can’t even put in to words how much I hate Avril Lavigne and her oversized fangs,"“The label didn’t tell me what to write, lyrically,” she insists. “I’m young at heart. I’m a free spirit. I’m super-fun. I love to hang out and have fun and dance and skateboard.” She reels off the diverse types of song she can write “in my sleep”: about love, breakups, partying, dancing, rock’n’roll, friendship. “I’m a fucking rock star, bitch!”",0
1407293291922702344,I can’t even put in to words how much I hate Avril Lavigne and her oversized fangs,"Perhaps it’s a sign of how effectively Arista marketed Lavigne’s debut that you want to believe there was a frustrated artist in there all along. Two years ago, a conspiracy theory that Lavigne had died and been replaced by a doppelganger went viral. It was absurd, and must have been extremely hurtful for Lavigne to witness people laughing about her hypothetical death when her health was so precarious. Beyond the delight of a well-reasoned crackpot theory, I don’t think people were gloating about her demise, but attempting to make sense of her jarring career: surely these artists weren’t the same person?",0
1407293291922702344,I can’t even put in to words how much I hate Avril Lavigne and her oversized fangs,"Musically, maybe Head Above Water is what will finally kill off the teenage immortal.

We were the same age with similar tastes in music, similar viewpoints on life, and similar, sarcastic senses of humor. We were both trying to make it in music and grow a fan base. We confided in each other. We trusted each other. We had an ongoing, supportive relationship that helped both of us when we sometimes felt there was nowhere else to turn. Few knew of my coversations with her - but some of Taylor’s closest friends did know they were taking place (they called me “the guy on MySpace,” as it is my understanding Taylor did not tell them my name).",0

We would discuss music, school, and random jokes we would make upon the fly. As time went on, the messages (and their topics) went from short and complimentary to in-depth and personal. We would write messages to one another that, if printed, would be multiple pages long. Looking back, these were the messages of two teenagers trying to find themselves and, in the process, found a friend in one another. We never had expectations, just a supportive friendship with a member of the opposite sex we could not seem to find offline.

I would do my best to encourage her from a distance and support her as the situation unfolded. Taylor did the same for me.

I began to emotionally struggle with the loss of a grandparent who had passed in 2002. As a young person, I had buried the pain for years and did not know how to cope. I had little in terms of a support mechanism in my “real” life. But things were just beginning in Taylor’s career. I thought that my burdens would weigh Taylor down. So, rather than turn to Taylor for support or tell her what happened, I did the only thing sixteen year old me knew how to do… I closed myself off, shut down my MySpace page… and tried to grapple with the experience on my own. To this day, I feel guilty about having left her out in the dark. But I still believe I did the right thing. Taylor had a dream we both shared and it was becoming a reality. I was not about to stand in the way by making her worry about her friend. She was too kind and sweet to me. Strapping her with that type of burden would have been unjustifiable.

Taylor is a kind, caring, compassionate person who wants nothing more than to love and be loved. Her acts of charity are not acts of publicity, they are acts of character. She has earned and deserves her career. Knowing her as I did, I cannot help but believe she often longs for normalcy, anonymity, and questions what it would be like if she were simply Taylor to this day - not the celebrity, but another person who lived life without being subjected to the critiques, comments, and ridicule.",0

We each had one-on-one time with her, as well as random mingling while she passed out cookies, and played us her album. When talking to her one-on-one she is extremely kind and listens very intently. She is great at small talk, and asking questions that make you feel comfortable. She is very open and caring towards us as fans - I mean she hugged me three times during our conversation. She clearly cultivates a good relationship with her employees who work for her via Taylor Nation. They all spoke highly of her, when Taylor was getting teary eyed over a girls story one of the Taylor Nation girls started crying. If you hated your boss you would not get emotional over their emotions. I have also interacted with Taylor on Tumblr and have followed her interactions with other fans. She is beyond kind and caring. I've seen her stand up to people who've bullied her fans, I've seen her send kind messages to my friend when she is hurting. While I understand her interactions with fans cannot always be considered ""real life,"" the amount of time she dedicates to her fans, the fact that she invited us into her home, has visited fans homes, etc., are all extraordinary actions that suggest she must be kind and caring in ""real life.""",0

1407293291922702344,I can’t even put in to words how much I hate Avril Lavigne and her oversized fangs,"Why? She’s remained relevant due mostly to her off-stage comments and behaviors. She presents herself as honest songwriter and a shameless primadonna. Young people really admire and respect that kind of gumption, whether it’s sincere or not. She’s certainly been adopted by the gay community as a gay icon for her zingers, and she’s been equally as supportive of the LGBT community.",1

1407293291922702344,I can’t even put in to words how much I hate Avril Lavigne and her oversized fangs,"She’s also a mega-star because she did something that few musicians are able to do which is cross over from one genre to another, while still keeping most of her initial fans. Not only did she keep her fans but she re-drew the lines of country music. If you listen to country radio in 2018, half the time you would think you’re listening to the top 40 pop station. It sounds a heck of a lot different than it did before she incorporated R&B pop into her music. Commercial country has changed beyond comprehension just within the last 10 years. Swift, or someone pulling the strings, is largely responsible for that change.",1

They are more like making fun of someone or you but you dont know until other people in the room are laughing by then it's too late. But she does it in a way that it's like normal conversation.

1399947362592727044,John Mayer is a trash heap but continuum belongs in the MoMA bitch,"Several reasons, actually.",0
1399947362592727044,John Mayer is a trash heap but continuum belongs in the MoMA bitch,"1. The 90s happened. Yes, great guitar albums came out in the 90s, but in more radio friendly music, there was a huge push back against the excess of the 80s. Production got less slick and polished, songs got simpler, and displays of shredding were deemed excessive or pointless. Back in the 70s and 80s, you had to be able to play to stand out and sell records, so guys like Eddie, George, Yngwie, Warren DeMartini, etc, could be main draws to a band. In the 90s, because of Nirvana and their ilk (though Alice In Chains is the lone exception here), it no longer mattered if you could solo or not: if you could write something catchy and record it in 3 takes or less, record companies wanted it.
2. The rockstar personalities of a lot of shredders. Don’t get me wrong, guys like George Lynch, Zakk Wylde, and Yngwie Malmsteen can back up almost everything they say, but they are some of the most self-important, arrogant punks you will ever hear speak complete sentences. They have and still do bad mouth basically everyone who can’t play a Randy Rhoads solo or do sweep arpeggios at 200bpm (Zakk is the worst offender of this), and this kind of snobbery turns a lot of people off of listening, and when no one’s listening, record companies stop paying for them to get put on tape and put on the radio. Moreover, because their egos are so tied to how much they can shred, they often force solos in there at the expense of their songs.
3. Soloing is hard. Playing guitar solos well requires a lot of practice at the very least and often more than a little study. You have to learn scales, moveable shapes of arpeggios, different picking styles (alternate, sweep, economy, finger style, etc), and various tricks of phrasing (bending, legato, tapping, whammy bar usage, etc). You have to develop a sense of musical phrasing to make yourself stand out as well. You have to build up dexterity in your fingers to speed AND precision. This takes a lot of time AND a lot of patience. Add to that the fact that a good guitar and amplifier are NOT cheap, meaning in addition to patience, you also gotta be willing to drop some serious coin to just get started. A lot of younger aspiring musicians just don’t see that time and money to do what effectively is showing off as worth it.
4. Guitar solos are often lacking in musicality and often are crowbarred in at the expense of the song. A lot of times a guitar solo isn’t there because it will enhance the song, but it’s just to show off the chops of one, or sometimes two, members of the band (see A7X, DragonForce, etc), whether it makes the song better or not. Let’s face it, a lot this is done just so they can show how fast they can play scales and sweeps, without any real thought for melody, musical theming, emotion, etc. And it is this way because rock and metal are guitar driven music, meaning the guitarists are the ones writing the majority of the music. When I was starting out in bands, I pushed to have a guitar solo everywhere I could, cause I wanted to put my chops front and center. I don’t do that anymore, obviously, unless it adds something to the song. And often times it sounded boring and crowbarred in, save for songs where it did add something emotionally or musically. And those ended up being a selling point for the bands I was in: I started in the hardcore/early metalcore scene, and solos were kind of not done much. Shredders can help sell a band, like Van Halen, Dokken, etc, but a lot of is just guitar wanking, and it gets old fast. As such, the guys that know four chords but who write catchy tunes are getting more work.
5. Guitar is out of fashion. For a large number of reasons, the guitar is no longer an instrument of choice. You can literally write a hit song with just a keyboard and computer now, and producing this way is a lot cheaper, requires less equipment, way less time, and way fewer expensive people to make it sound good. And the record industry is slowly killing itself, so it’s looking at what’s cheap and easy to market. So bands that will need a recording studio, an advance to get decent instruments, and an expensive producer to make it not sound like garbage often just aren’t worth the effort when some SoundCloud moron can go viral by himself and cost virtually nothing out their pockets in comparison.
So that’s why no one solos anymore.",0

2. They are jealous of him and slating his playing is the only thing that helps them cope with that.",0
1399947362592727044,John Mayer is a trash heap but continuum belongs in the MoMA bitch,"1. Repetitive/limited phrasing: He almost exclusively falls back on minor pentatonic/blues licks. There’s nothing wrong with this, and almost all rock guitarists still come from this tradition. Slash, Santana - even Eddie Van Halen - have made a killing off of playing blues licks. The difference is that these guitarists are creative with their phrasing, and gain a lot of mileage out of one or two scales, whereas Kirk’s solos have invariably contained the same old pedal-steel bends, ascending/descending triplet patterns on the pentatonic scale, and that atonal picked pattern he does down the high E string for the past 35 years (I don’t even have to tab these things out, and you probably know what I’m talking about). When you combine all this with Metallica’s innovative off-kilter song structures and odd-time riffs, the results are often less than spectacular.
2. Limited harmonic conception: Despite (briefly) studying with Joe Satriani, Kirk possesses only a very basic grasp of tonal harmony. I can’t believe this isn’t said more, but a RIDICULOUS amount of Metallica solos pre-Load have moments where he’s playing in a flat-out wrong key over the chord changes. Kirk calls it a “modal” approach. However, his tendency for playing stock blues licks and phrases (now away from the home key) makes it sound like doesn’t know what key he’s in. There is a recent video where he jams with Michael Schenker over an A blues and solos over the entire thing as if it’s in E. [ https://youtu.be/uj1e8Ll1pBI?t=53 ] Once again, modes are fine, but without properly resolving notes and phrases, it doesn’t sound like he is listening or playing with intent.
3. Musicality vs technique: Kirk’s style is almost exclusively technique-driven, relying on scale patterns, precision, and speed. The problem is that he’s on the lower end of this spectrum even in this field. He’s not anywhere near as fast or precise as Malmsteen or Becker. He doesn’t know as many scales as Satriani or Vai. He’s not even as rhythmically interesting as Mustaine when it comes to soloing. The stuff he DOES know is simply not executed well or pleasing to listen to. This is true of his bends (consistently sharp) and his vibrato (uncontrolled, narrow, and rapid). The result is that he’s kind of just “there” on Metallica’s records to throw in the obligatory hard rock/heavy metal guitar solo, or, as Malmsteen criticized him in a 1994 blind test, “anticlimactic”.
4. Musicianship: As in Kirk’s has regressed. He was a good replacement for Mustaine in 1983, but since then he has never developed his technique and artistry (in all fairness, the same can be said about pretty much the rest of Metallica post-AJFA) and has actually gotten sloppier over time. It’s fair to say that he’s a follower in the context of the band, but even then that’s not an excuse to not do your job at at least a consistent level.
5. Wah pedal abuse: This is subjective but I’m generally not a fan of mindlessly mashing the wah pedal while you have heavy distortion. I’ve never heard Kirk use the wah pedal effectively during a solo, yet nowadays he employs it almost all the time, sort of like how James Hetfield feels the need to yell “OOH YEAHAUGH” all the time.",0

1399947362592727044,John Mayer is a trash heap but continuum belongs in the MoMA bitch,"First off, without Katy Perry tweeting out about it, no one would have known ‘Bad Blood' was about Katy Perry. Taylor has never talked about their feud. Katy is the one who talks about it. I have to wonder, did Katy Perry ever inform Taylor that the clause the backup dancers put in their contracts was put there so they could leave and go on tour with Katy? If not, Taylor's people may have never hired them in the first place, investing time into people who weren't loyal. Taylor values loyalty. It's petty, but Katy drew attention to it. The only time hints about the feud were given was in the ‘Look What You Made Me Do' video, which was after a long time of Katy Perry shading Taylor and alluding to her in ‘Swish Swish'. There were no allusions in ‘Bad Blood'. It was a petty fight. We've all done petty things before. Diss tracks are nothing new. Unless you are trying to say that Taylor Swift invented diss tracks? Which, is false. When asked about it once, Ed Sheeran says he also writes diss tracks. He says just no one is as obsessed to pry into his life and track down people, so they don't get references. Besides, I think Katy Perry and Taylor Swift have buried the hatchet. Also, I'll talk about the exes thing. Taylor wrote about bad exes because they were bad boyfriends. Joe Jonas broke up with her on the phone (they are friends now, but it was very devastating at the time). Her song written about Taylor Lautner was an apology to him. John Mayer is an egotistical asshole. Even his fans agree. That is why people have compiled entire lists of his douchbag quotes. Jake Gyllenhaal was scared of commitment. They fell in love very quick, and it scared him. She never dissed Harry Styles, just wrote some songs about him. Everyone writes about their exes. Beyonce has a whole album trashing Jay-Z. Calvin's tweet wasn't because Taylor got together with Tom. It was because Taylor's management revealed she was the one who wrote Calvin's hit song he did for Rihanna, ‘This is What You Came For'. He felt that people knowing she wrote it made people not value his work as a DJ. He said he regretted the tweeting spree later on. Now, I'll talk about your hypocritical feminism point. Everyone has been a hypocrite in their lives. For most, it is multiple times. I'll give an example of a hypocritical feminist you seem to enjoy: Demi Lovato. Taylor donated $250,000 to Kesha during her trial to help with legal fees. After Kesha's mom posted about it, Taylor's team released a statement saying it was true. Demi then went on a rant about how Taylor Swift should “Take something to Capitol Hill or actually speak out about something and then I'll be impressed”. She also cited that not everyone has $250,000 to just give away (If it is true for her, she must manage her money poorly. Since, Demi Lovato is a very successful actress and singer). I could be annoyed at her drawing the attention away from Kesha following the loss of her trial, but it would be fine if it was only that. Later on, Taylor Swift was involved in a sexual assault trial of her own. A radio host who had groped her at a meet and greet in 2013 was trying to sue her for 3 million dollars in damages. He filed the lawsuit in 2015, saying he got fired due to it and citing Taylor Swift as the reason. The litigation eventually led to a trial in 2017. Sonce he was suing her, she countersued for just $1 (the lowest you can) to prove a point that sexual assault is NOT okay. After powerful, grueling testimony from Swift, her mother, a bodyguard, a photographer, and a damning photo, the judge dismissed this radio hosts claims, and a jury found him guilty of the assault. You may wonder why I am providing you with this information. The reason is, although Demi was outspoken when Kesha's trial took place, she said NOTHING about the Taylor Swift trial. Taylor's trial was groundbreaking. Rape and assault hotlines recieved massive spikes in calls. Taylor's testimony is being used as an example for other victims during their trial. Little miss feminist Demi, all about speaking out for other women and against sexual assault, said nothing in support of Swift. Demi is a hypocritical feminist. I like her voice and her music, but I lost respect for her after she claimed to advocate against sexual assault, but couldn't bring herself to tweet in support of Swift. She isn't even the only one, either. People are so into blanket dislike that they couldn't even bring themselves to realize that in this case, Swift was just like every other sexual assault victim.",0
1399947362592727044,John Mayer is a trash heap but continuum belongs in the MoMA bitch,"Second, the Kimye situation is totally blown out of proportion. Kanye only told Taylor about HALF of the lyrics. In the phone call, he rhymes ‘I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex' with another line. Therefore, he was implying that there was no other lyric in reference to her. The half she took offence to was the ‘I made that bitch famous' part. In her acceptance speech, she says not to let anyone take credit for your fame. She never gave him permission to take credit for hers, since she never approved of that half of the lyrics. It's like if a friend asked you if they could post a pic of your face, you agreed, and they posted a pic of not only your face, but your naked body as well. Taylor has never liked being called a bitch, and has said that over the years. He never played her the song or the video. She did not agree to the other half of the lyrics, as Kim would have released that part of the phone call if she did. Kimye release an extremely smaller portion of an hour long conversation. Taylor shouldn't have lied about never getting a phone call, but Kim and Kanye have done much worse things in the past.",0
1399947362592727044,John Mayer is a trash heap but continuum belongs in the MoMA bitch,"Finally, Taylor is not a friend stealer. That is such a childish way to think about things. Selena just didn't want to hang out with Demi anymore. Not because of Taylor, but because they just stopped being friends for an unknown reason. Nobody can steal a friend if they are truly your friend. Also, Selena and Taylor are STILL best friends. I know it may be hard for some to wrap their minds around, but you don't have to hang out with someone every second to be their friend. Selena and Taylor have both said that there was NEVER a feud. Watch Selena talk about Taylor during her guest performance on the Reputation tour. On the subject of why she also makes new friends, she has said ""It's not something I can control; it's like a genetic part of my personality ... My greatest strength is not disliking new people or being around people, even if I don't know them”. I don't see a problem with her having multiple friends. People just see it as weird because she is Taylor Swift. Just like how she actually dated less that the average person her age, but people liked to attack her for daring to go out with someone once in a while.",0
1399947362592727044,John Mayer is a trash heap but continuum belongs in the MoMA bitch,"In conclusion, Taylor Swift is not deserving of all of the hate she gets. She is one of the most charitable, humble, down-to-earth celebrities, just trying to live her life. Unlike others, she is under intense scrutiny. She can't tweet in support of women's marches without being attacked for not actually marching (if she did, the march would have turned into a circus). She donates millions to causes ranging from childhood cancer research to sexual assault victim's charities to education to disaster relief to clean water. A lot of it she tries to keep private, and when the media finds out, they accuse her of doing it for publicity. She visits hospitals any chance she gets without advertising it (we find out about just a portion of her visits through videos posted by family members). She really pays attention to her fans, talking with them online through tumblr, twitter, instagram, etc. Her meet and greets are free. She has invited fans to her house, delivered presents to them for Christmas and Valentine's Day, and will even say hi to you by your name or username if she recognizes you from online. She even bought a homeless pregnant fan a house and a bunch of baby stuff (not advertised, the fan posted the story a few months after it happened to the Taylor Swift app). Sure, she can be petty like everyone. Sure, she has made a few mistakes. However, in a 12 year career, who hasn't?",0

1397999264882626560,Jennifer Lopez is a bad bitch since she got an ex bragging about her,"First of all, Jennifer Lopez's apartment looks exactly as you'd imagined, a penthouse in the sky replete with tasteful floral arrangements, flickering Le Labo candles, and sofas in shades of ecru, cream, and white that, while cozy, appear remarkably unsullied by the debris of human life. The most surprising thing about the place is the location: It's smack in the middle of a busy part of Manhattan, and yet, at the same time, it's very private. Looking out from her terrace, you can see thousands of people bustling about, but no one can see you. Jennifer Lopez is GQ's Icon of the Year. Click here to subscribe to GQ. This was where Lopez was sitting on a recent Sunday. She had just finished working out, because of course she had, and was sipping a cappuccino in makeup-less splendor. That's when a late-season bee, perhaps mistaking her famous skin for actual honey, suddenly dive-bombed her face. I must have made a sound like NOT HER FACE, MOTHERFUCKER because Lopez said, “It's just a bee,” and waved it away. Because of course. She can handle a bee. She's Jennifer Lopez. When Lopez first signed on to produce and star in Hustlers, a movie inspired by an article I wrote for New York magazine, I was as familiar with her work as anyone else on planet Earth. Which is to say, I was familiar with it in the way that I was familiar with, say, air. Movies like The Wedding Planner and songs like “Waiting for Tonight” were things I'd ingested and enjoyed my entire life and essentially considered a basic human right. But it's fair to say that I didn't fully appreciate Jennifer Lopez's work—as in, the extraordinary amount of labor she puts into making these works of art and being Jennifer Lopez—until I created a Google Alert for the movie, which had the side benefit of giving me a daily digest of Lopez's activities for over a year. It was like watching Carmen Sandiego or something. Every time I opened my email, she was somewhere, doing something. For Hustlers, in which she plays Ramona, a tough-as-nails career stripper turned criminal, Lopez learned to pole dance, enduring numerous bruises to her thighs to deliver what will go down as the most iconic pole-dancing scene in cinematic history. After the movie was shot—over 29 days this spring—she took off on her “It's My Party” tour, singing and dancing and jumping out of cakes for sold-out audiences. At one point, I saw a photo of her hanging from a giant sparkly ring onstage, which reminded me that sometime before she'd also gotten engaged to Alex Rodriguez. Then, over the summer, she turned 50, a milestone she celebrated as one should—with a massive blowout at Gloria Estefan's house in Miami. Then, like a week after Hustlers came out in September, while the entire internet was obsessing about her performance and demanding she be given an Oscar right now, she created a wholly new iconic moment, at Donatella Versace's show in Milan, when she appeared in an updated version of the green dress that broke the internet the last time she wore it, nearly 20 years ago. Then she popped back to New York to start work with Owen Wilson and Maluma on Marry Me, which she describes as “a mix of a rom-com and The Bodyguard.” She distracted people from herself with herself.",0
1397999264882626560,Jennifer Lopez is a bad bitch since she got an ex bragging about her,"Given the year she's had—which will spill into next, with awards season and her Super Bowl performance with Shakira just around the corner—it's tempting to frame this as a moment. A Lopezaissance, if you will. But is it? At one point during our conversation on her terrace, Lopez refers to “the busiest year of her life,” and it turns out she's talking about a different year. And looking back, one discovers an embarrassment of headlines proclaiming past years to be Her Year, Her Moment, or Her Comeback. To which Jennifer Lopez tosses her head back and yells the only sane response: “Don't call it a comeback—I been here for years!” As her LL Cool J impression travels through the air, over the terrace, through the trees, and into the streets of Manhattan, I imagine it landing in the ear of a passerby who, turning their head skyward, says, “Is that Jennifer Lopez?” GQ: Someone, after seeing Hustlers, tweeted, “Jennifer Lopez is a bad bitch,” which I understood to be a compliment but did not realize was a lyric from “I'm Real,” until I came across an oral history of the song, which talks about how you wrote the line in the studio and beckoned Puffy to come sing it.",0

That “Jenny From the Block” side. With my Timberlands and my hoops. 'Cause we came from such a hard kind of background in that way. Growing up on those types of streets, I used to see girls fighting.

Her relationship with Puff Daddy was super interesting though and I think they made the best couple, but she seems to have broken his heart.

1397999264882626560,Jennifer Lopez is a bad bitch since she got an ex bragging about her,"It’s very obvious why it didn’t work out with A Rod and Marc Anthony. The 2 men are Latino and Latino men, no matter how rich they are, want a woman who cooks (even if its just once a week), and who spends time at home being a wife and mother. Do you think J Lo has ever cooked an entire Thanksgiving meal for any of her men? Think about it. Aside from this, she is VERY busy which takes away from spending time at home. She’s singing at the White House, making movies, singing at the Superbowl, doing photo shoots, seeking publicity etc. Aside from this, let’s admit, she loves publicity and is a bit of a DIVA. Imagine being a man, and you go out with her and people are constantly flocking to her and you are standing in the sidelines. After a while, you get annoyed with it. Almost all of the men that she has been with have treated her like a princess and bought her cars and jewels. After a while, men want to be adored and paid attention to. Are you getting where I am coming from? It’s very obvious. So the men start cheating or pulling away or arguments start. As far as Caspar Smart: that was sex and companionship- he’s too young and doesn’t make enough money for her. He can’t afford to buy her jewels. As far a P Diddy, he got in trouble with the police and that’s why she left. Back in the day, Ben Affleck sorta cheated on her. They were engaged and he was at a strip bar in Vancouver getting lap dances so she dumped him. I’m old enough and I remember it hitting the news. Bottom line is she is very busy and a bit self absorbed.",0

This definitely isn’t good; what is life without free speech? How does this relate to Apple and Overwatch, though?

This resulted in many protestors filling the crowd at NBA games and other heroes tricking the camera into displaying shirts that support Hong Kong or call LeBron James a bitch. This kerfuffle caused other players to voice their own opinions, with LeBron James’s shitty statement being the most notable of all. LeBron claimed that Morey was “misinformed” and “not educated about the situation at all.” I’m not 100% sure though, it was hard to hear him with a mouthful of Chinese boot.

This has resulted in a massive boycott against Blizzard, who still haven’t recovered from their “Diablo: Immortal” controversy back at Blizzcon 2018. Blizzard is likely the most notable bootlicker of all, since it directly resulted in a letter from Congress to Blizzard urging them to revert their decision for blitzchung. This letter had bipartisan support, being signed by big names for both parties, such as Marco Rubio and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. In a political climate where the parties seem to be growing further apart, it’s very nice to see them come together and agree on not only the Blizzard situation, but the Hong Kong situation as a whole.

Ubisoft planned to release one worldwide censored version of their hit first-person shooter: “Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six: Siege.” They would censor any references to skulls, gambling, knives, and other menial bullshit just to increase their profits. However, the fan backlash was utterly insane, which resulted in them backtracking and releasing two separate versions: one for China and one for everyone else. In addition, they added and kept two “operators” from Hong Kong into the game, rather than avoiding controversy and omitting them completely. Valve also handled their Hong Kong situation gracefully when having to deal with it. Professional Counter Strike: Global Offensive player from Hong Kong, Wing Hei “Freeman” Cheung also came out in support of the protests in Hong Kong. However, Valve made no statement on the matter, as it isn’t their business to make a statement about the matter.

Russell’s 44% shooting from the field was the third best in the NBA. Next to Jack Twyman and Cliff Hagan (both of whome averaged more points than Russell and had a better shooting percentage). Bill Russell’s Free Throw percentage was horrific even by 1957 standards. Bill Russell made just 51.9% of his free throws. The best free throw shooter that season was Dolph Schayes who made 90.4% of his free throws. In fact, 15 players made more than 80% of their free throws. So even by 1957 standards Bill Russell was a horrific free throw shooter. One can even say that Russell was not a great offensive player.",0

Celtics also had a top 5 scorer in Bill Sharman, and another guy named Tom Heinsohn that averaged 17 points and 10 rebounds per game. Sharman and Cousy were also the second and third best free shooters in the entire league. On top of that they had the best coach in the NBA with Red Auerbech at the time (also probably overrated when you consider him as one of the best in the NBA). So all the credit does not go to Russell for the team’s performance.

4. David Robinson - If you just go by the box score, he's statistically as good as any center outside of Wilt and Kareem, and on par with Shaq and Hakeem. If you actually watched the last five minutes of a close playoff game with your own two eyes, before the Spurs got Duncan, David Robinson came up small when it mattered most.
5. Reggie Miller - He was a great shooter, who didn't rebound, didn't defend, and couldn't put the ball on the floor in traffic for more than two dribbles. The best player on the Pacers team that went to the Finals wasn't Reggie Miller, it was Jalen Rose.
6. Vince Carter - Physically, he had everything you could want from a player; athleticism, speed, leaping ability, could shoot and pass. Mentally, something was missing. He had one great playoff run in Toronto and then it was over and he became a scorer for hire.
7. Pete Maravich - The original White Chocalate; he was a scoring machine who had every move and pass in the book. He also only got out of the first round once in a decade.
8. Chris Webber - He had a great run in Sacramento, and a terrible run in Washington. He was supposed to be what Tim Duncan became; the greatest power forward of all time. Instead, he was surpassed by Duncan, Garnett, and Nowitzki.
9. Carmelo Anthony - I was a Melo guy when he was in Denver, I stopped being a Melo guy in New York. In Denver, George Karl and the players that were around him masked his deficiencies. In New York, they were glaring. If he wasn't scoring, he wasn't doing anything to help you win. He was a deterrent when it came to ball movement because he was one of the best isolation scorers in history, too bad that's all he was.
10. Paul Pierce - He was one of the best players at his position for a decade. He's on this list strictly because he keeps going on t.v. and saying he was better than players he wasn't better than, or saying he was better at certain things than they were, or saying he was the first player to do something. He wasn't better than Wade or Ginobili, he wasn't a better shooter than Klay, and he didn't invent the step-back, Kiki VanDeWeghe did.",0

Truly sad.","1. Kobe Bryant - undoubtedly the most overrated player of all time. I have a very detailed explanation as to why here Tong Zou's answer to Why does everyone have Kobe Bryant top 5 all time? I have him top 12 for sure, maybe even top 10 [ https://www.quora.com/Why-does-everyone-have-Kobe-Bryant-top-5-all-time-I-have-him-top-12-for-sure-maybe-even-top-10/answer/Xitong-Zou-1 ] A lot of fans put him #2 all time - some even put him #1 all time as the GOAT over Jordan (yes unbelievably)
2. Allen Iverson - one of the worst shooters to ever be a superstar, Iverson gets most of his popularity from his ‘toughness’ and the ‘hiphop’ attitude he brought to the game
3. Isiah Thomas - surprising? don’t be. Isiah gets way too much credit for leading the Bad Boy Pistons to 2 championships - but he wasn’t a great shooter, didn’t play defense as well as any of his teammates, and only led the league in assists once. Despite this, a lot of fans put him in their top 5 PGs all time. The Pistons were a great team Isiah was just one cog in their engine but because he was their leader people give Isiah mostly all the credit - Dumars/Rodman/Aguirre/Mahorn/Laimbeer/Johnson had a lot to do with their success too
4. Carmelo Anthony - is he one of the greatest offensive players ever? perhaps. He is perhaps fairly rated now but most of his career he was overrated. A ball hog that only served to drag the team down, it’s no wonder that every team he’s ever been on gets worse with him playing
5. Steph Curry - see my answer here Xitong Zou's answer to Who is the most overrated point guard in NBA history? [ https://www.quora.com/Who-is-the-most-overrated-point-guard-in-NBA-history/answer/Xitong-Zou-1 ]
What do the players I cite all have in common? they were all “flashy” players (also called the ‘eye test’ by ignorant fans to justify their high ranking i.e you don’t know how great __ is because you never saw him play! the eye test you fool!). Flashy players tend to be overrated because of the excitement they bring on court leads fans to believe that they are better than they actually are. This is the reason why people think Kobe is better than Duncan. He’s not. But because he played in a bigger market, had ‘flashier’/’skilled’ moves, he gets ranked higher.",0

This is quite logical, because the more fans that a player has, the more likely that there is going to be a significant casual following. The most die hard basketball fans are only ever going to be a minority. Most basketball fans do not know or care about John Havlicek or Moses Malone - but they know about Kobe and Curry because these guys are the big names. The most heavily marketed. In every industry it’s almost certain that the most heavily marketed (i.e BTS for Kpop, Marvel movies for the film industry, Apple for the electronics industry etc) are also the most overrated by the nature of having a lot of casual, dedicated fans.",0

But you’ll notice that the media never posts anything negative about Kobe after his retirement and especially not after his unfortunate passing. Curry just never got any negative media coverage ever in his career. Based on the media posts on these two players, you would think that they never missed a shot and they always won and never lost in their life. Something common to both seems to be whenever their team wins, it’s always because of them. But whenever they lose, it’s always their teammate’s fault or injuries. Their fans will never ever blame them for any loss and excuse it on something else.",0

Casual fans, due to their ignorance or refusal to care about context, only care about ONE award (rings) and ONE stat (points). That’s the two most important things to them. Kobe has 5 rings and he scored a lot of points. That’s the two most important things to casual fans, which is why Kobe ranks so high for them.

He also had the fortune to be coached by one of the GOAT coaches in Phil Jackson. He also had the fortune to have the biggest sized team in the league in the late 2000s with a trio (Odom/Gasol/Bynum) of great rebounders which gave him the green light to shoot without much fear of missed shots. The amount of talent those Lakers teams had - how many people know that Horace Grant and Mitch Richmond and Dennis Rodman played for those Lakers?

She came after not only Courtney son, but conventioneer Wallace, who played Hushpuppy in Beasts of the Southern Wild and also Annie in the Annie remake. And so in 2013 conventioneer, who was then nine years old, spent so much time that year getting people to properly pronounce her name. She spent time on the red carpet talking about how to pronounce her name. And apparently that was just too much for Christie to handle because Christie tweets during the Oscars red carpet. Is it OK to call a small child Cocchi before then? Adding, I am forced to like conventioneer Wallis because she’s a child. Right. OK, fine.",0

I truly enjoy your podcast and feel like I’ve learned quite a bit from the ladies. And I appreciate the opportunity to learn. I don’t understand the choreographed dance of quitting social media because I can tell from the celebrity news that does filter into my brain, it seems to involve four steps. Number one, the ring. It step to the ceremonial leave-taking of Twitter, Facebook, step number three, interregnum, a variable duration and step member for I’m back on social media, baby, I have questions. Is this group necessary? Can’t one just delete accounts and erase media? If a tree falls in the forest, does it still count? It’s twenty, twenty one. And even I know that social media can be toxic. When is that no longer news to anyone? Why does that count as a novel observation? And the biggest question of all, why are they back? Did people online suddenly become nicer, mystified? Tim.",0

Before Chrissy Teigen left, there was one final pandemic, Twitter dust up that put her name in headlines. Again, this one involving the creator of the soup, the cookies. God, Miss Schallert Pasta herself, Roman.",0

1394697425458122752,Chrissy Teigen is a nasty woman! President Trump RIGHT AGAIN! White heavy check mark,"S3: So in March of this year, Chrissy Teigen announces out of the blue that she’s leaving Twitter for good. She has had enough quote for two years. I have taken so many small to follower count punches that at this point I am honestly deeply bruised. She says that she’s made mistakes in front of hundreds of thousands of people and has been held accountable for them. But she hasn’t been able to block out the negativity and that she is leaving Twitter. You can hold it in both hands, right in one hand. It’s like I am sure Chrissy Teigen has experienced just violent, graphic threats of all nature. On the other hand, the accountability she’s talking about are four things she said and meant and kept saying. But it doesn’t really seem like she’s truly been held accountable for those things. Right?",0
1394697425458122752,Chrissy Teigen is a nasty woman! President Trump RIGHT AGAIN! White heavy check mark,"S2: Yeah. There’s this kind of interesting turn that a lot of Tegan’s fans and ambivalent observers kind of pull where if you call Tiguan out for the things that she’s done, there’s this kind of bad faith turn where it’s like you’re aligning yourself. For people like Candice Owens and Kuhnen bots by attacking Chrissy Teigen and the answer to that line of argument is both, and we can hold two things in our hands. There is nuance. We can walk and chew gum. Just because Chrissy Teigen has been attacked by Donald Trump and Candice Owens does not excuse the fact that she has done things for which she should be criticized",0

I know we’ve said this. I think at least seven times STON was 16 years old, was being clearly groomed. And so at the same time that they are being manipulated, they are also receiving death threats from people like Tiguan, who finally, 10 years later decides to apologize on Twitter, of course. And Tinnen says that she’s tried unsuccessfully to reach out to son personally and wants to put an apology out in public since the comments that she made were public. Tegan writes, I am ashamed and completely embarrassed and my behavior, but that is nothing compared to how I made Courtney feel. I have worked so hard to give you guys joy and be beloved, and the feeling of letting you down is nearly unbearable.

It’s about the fact that you harassed and attacked a sixteen year old. For what reason? Courtney Stodden accepted the apology, the public one, but says that’s not true. Tegan still has Courtney blocked on Twitter, and Thatn says that Tegan has not made any attempts to reach out personally. Stodden writes, All of me wants to believe this is a sincere apology, but it feels like a public attempt to save her partnerships with Target and other brands who are realizing her, quote, weakness is a broken record.",0

I just don’t care for her stridency. I get that no one in Hollywood likes Trump but there was a tweet she fired off to him directly awhile back that was so rude. I don’t think you necessarily have to like the president but you should show respect for the office. When all these celebrities get up on their high horse about Trump they don’t get it that it makes our whole country look bad when they are posting stuff on social media. I think it weakens how we look. I think it sends the message to other countries that our own citizens don’t respect the White House so feel free to do whatever you want to us. No matter how bad our president is (he might not be good but he’s 1000 times better than dictatorships in other countries and we are enjoying freedom and not running for our lives) I think openly disrespecting the office is low class and just not wise.,0

1393978591495475200,Anne Hathaway is a terrible actress to me. She plays a different version of the same character in every movie she’s in. With the exception of Les Miserables where they chopped her hair off made her look dirty and gave her a British accent to force the difference.,"With her pixie haircut and big brown eyes, aristocratic air, toothpaste smile and acclaimed roles in movies from The Devil Wears Prada to Brokeback Mountain, her coronation as best supporting actress at Sunday’s Academy Awards for her emotionally wrenching role in Les Misérables should have been a moment of triumph. Instead it proved to be the event where the 30-year-old beauty realised that she is the most hated woman in Hollywood. Oscar’s golden girl has become the target of the most astonishing vitriolic personal attacks by a legion of haters among cinema-goers. “The best supporting actress winner almost won the most detested figure of the night,” proclaimed one website, placing her a close second to reviled Oscar host Seth MacFarlane. “People do not like Anne Hathaway,” says Hollywood.com’s Brian Moylan. “Their hatred is vehement.” The flood of antipathy prompted New York magazine to wonder: “Why do women hate Anne Hathaway?” As she made the rounds of awards shows this year her speeches appeared too practised, complained naysayers. With each victory she seemed to struggle harder to feign humility. Her gushing Golden Globes speech, which many critics viewed as coldly calculated faux-surprise, inspired a tsunami of online hate: 19,685 tweets per minute. A typical example: “Can’t watch the Golden Globes any more b/c Anne Hathaway called her award a ‘weapon of self-doubt’ and I threw my pizza at the TV and shattered it.” Her whispered opening words on winning the Academy award – “It came true…” – only gave her detractors more ammunition. Search Google for “Anne Hathaway” and “hate” and you’ll find around 36.5 million hits. Dispirited, Hathaway confesses: “It does get to me.” Online the army of Hathaway haters is burgeoning. “I love that everyone has their own personal reason for hating Anne Hathaway but in the end we can all come together to agree she’s awful,” posted one contributor. Another tweeted: “It’s like they took all the things that people find annoying and put them in one person.” And among the other similar sniping observations was: “Anne Hathaway reminds me of that kid in school all the other kids didn’t really like but all the teachers loved.” Dave Karger of movie website Fandango says: “Of all the actresses in her generation I can’t think of someone as polarising as her.”",0
1393978591495475200,Anne Hathaway is a terrible actress to me. She plays a different version of the same character in every movie she’s in. With the exception of Les Miserables where they chopped her hair off made her look dirty and gave her a British accent to force the difference.,"Top radio DJ Howard Stern, explaining the animosity after she won a Screen Actors Guild award, said: “Let me sum up why people hate Anne Hathaway. ""First of all she gets a speechwriter to write her speech. She’s overly dramatic at these awards shows. She’s always out of breath. ""She’s even acting when she’s winning an award.” Insiders claim she rehearsed her Oscar acceptance speech, paradoxically in a bid to sound more spontaneous. “She was very aware that she had been the butt of everyone’s jokes,” admits a source. So what lies behind this antipathy? Hathaway comes across as over-eager and insincere, claims Hollywood.com. “She makes everything all about her, even when trying to come off as sweet and humble.” Many view her as too “actorly” and overly dramatic. She is the needy, annoying “theatre kid” who has been told she’s America’s sweetheart and believes it. Behind her vilification may partly be what Australians call “tall poppy syndrome”: the desire to bring the successful and powerful down to size. “Deep down, we loathe celebrities,” says film critic and author David Thomson. “We envy them. We think they don’t deserve it. We hate the influence they have over us.” There’s no doubting that she was once loved and admired, ever since her debut as the preppy ingenue in The Princess Diaries. She traded in her Disney tiara for indie fi lm credibility in Brokeback Mountain and the searing Rachel Getting Married. And with The Devil Wears Prada she scored a commercial blockbuster while transforming herself into a fashion plate. Off screen she won sympathy in 2008 when her boyfriend Raffaello Follieri was jailed for conning investors and lying about his business ties to the Vatican and she wept publicly. Emotionally wounded and vulnerable she became the over-eager theatre kid again, bringing a maniacal energy to hosting the panned 2011 Academy Awards ceremony and antagonising critics with her ferocious ambition. People evidently liked her better when she was unhappy. Since she found success in such blockbusters as The Dark Knight Rises, not to mention renewed love and happiness with husband of six months Adam Shulman, her detractors have been multiplying. There is also a chauvinistic double standard at play. “Young women in Hollywood cannot win, no matter what they do,” says feminist blogger Roxanne Gay.",0
1393978591495475200,Anne Hathaway is a terrible actress to me. She plays a different version of the same character in every movie she’s in. With the exception of Les Miserables where they chopped her hair off made her look dirty and gave her a British accent to force the difference.,"Ambition is seen as attractive in men and unpleasant in women. Many found Hathaway’s awards push for Les Misérables painfully grating. “I felt like I sprouted a pair of wings and lifted off of the ground,” she gushed of her experience making the film. During another awards ceremony honouring the entire Les Misérables cast the rest had barely uttered a few words before she commandeered the microphone. When the film won best musical at the Golden Globes she grabbed the microphone to thank people she’d forgotten in her earlier two-minute speech accepting best supporting actress. Yet she does retain supporters. Lena Dunham, writer and star of American hit comedy TV series Girls, told the detractors: “Ladies, Anne Hathaway is a feminist and she has amazing teeth. Let’s save our bad attitudes for the ones who aren’t advancing the cause.” But it doesn’t help that even when trying to put a brave face on all the criticism she comes across as painfully theatrical. “You have to remember in life that there’s a positive to every negative and a negative to every positive,” she says. And it’s hard not to squirm when she makes herself out to be the Mother Teresa of Hollywood, saying: “I live my life with love. I live my life with compassion. I live my life hoping the best for absolutely everyone, no matter how they feel about me. And when you live that way it’s amazing how beautiful every day can be.” Oh dear.",0

Of course, people have their own opinions on what makes someone attractive, and all the People’s Most Beautiful People inclusions won’t make a difference if you think she looks weird. Another common complaint: “This is Maggie Gyllenhaal all over again!” — this is a reference to the common opinion that Maggie Gyllenhaal replacing Katie Holmes for the character of Rachel Dawes was a mistake, because even though Gyllenhaal is a better actress, she wasn’t “as hot.”",0

First of all, the costume looks silly and Tim Burton-y like everything in that movie, and it doesn’t actually look that flattering. It’s also not skintight, so perverts, stop complaining about that aspect.

But why? It could be more Tonal Misplacement, a character that seems too fantastical to fit in Nolan’s Gotham. Or perhaps you don’t like Catwoman as a character, ruined by Halle Barry’s terrible movie Catwoman. You may even be worried that the film will succumb to “Far Too Many Villains Syndrome” like Spiderman 3. All fair points.

• “The ears look stupid”This sort of comment is meaningless until we’ve seen the actual movie — a photo without context is utterly pointless to make any judgments.
• “I don’t know why, she’s just … I don’t know”If there is no reason you can adequately put forth for your opinion, maybe you shouldn’t voice that opinion at all. Or perhaps you’re just prejudiced against Anne Hathaway.
• “I’d prefer … <x>”Perhaps someone else could have been a better choice, but it’s too late now for that — at least for this trilogy.

You know she's probably just having a fun time, but good Lord, you don't have to sell it so hard.

Or how about her nails-on-a-chalkboard, overly theatrical acceptance speech at the BAFTAs, during which she breathlessly thanked, among others, her hair and makeup artist, author Victor Hugo, and also herself for having laryngitis, otherwise she might burst into song. She also called out co-star Eddie Redmayne, who was reportedly backstage vomiting from food poisoning. ""Hey, Eddie,"" she joked, ""Get well soon. I'd come and hold your hair, but, you know..."" After the long-winded and warbling dissertation, one viewer tweeted (via the Daily Mail), ""Sigh.

GAWD — what is it about that laugh that drives everyone crazy? Maybe it's because she's acting and so the laugh seems forced?

She's so used to transforming into different characters, that she's lost her way a little bit. It's not necessarily a bad thing. In fact, I think that's common in Hollywood. Nevertheless, the drama that she brings to the big screen is often duplicated in real life as well, and us Hathahaters can't take it.

I doubt she even needs to do that many auditions; she has that kind of talent that people just trust, which is why it's annoying AF that she speaks about the hardships of acting in such a ""woe is me"" sort of way.

Anne Hathaway, while not an A-list film star, is a popular performer in Hollywood at the moment. That means that unless she is high or drunk (or both) her every appearance or utterances is carefully choreographed so that she remains a popular figure.  That also means that if she is going to wear a designer dress to an event as important as the Academy Awards, she not only involves her agent, but her publicist as well in the decision.
 
Her career simply cannot risk waiting until the day of an event and then appearing is a dress which might be:
 
1. Wrinkled
2. Stained
3. The wrong color
4. Not the best fit for her.
5. Not the best ""look"" for her",0

The dresses would have been designed and fitted previously, but maybe finishing touches weren't there, or maybe the actress left it up to the designer as to which one would be worn. A lot of actresses are there to model for a designer on these occasions, so they don't have control over what makes it to the red carpet. It's all arranged in advance, though, even the accessories and the make-up. Since Anne does model, it's likely she was just being someone's dressing doll. It does take 3-4 hours to get ready before a show.",0

She uses many faces and phases on screen, true, but the moral strength required to portray those phases and faces with such brilliance comes from tireless efforts.

This is a simple fact of human behavior, it's why fads and trends happen, and it drives most of these exact sort of situations. Some famous person starts off beloved or doing well, but then is subjected to a sudden backlash as their popularity and success grows. Then, something happens that eventually ""redeems"" them among the majority of the haters who really weren't true ""haters"" at all, but who in fact were just members of a fad.

There's frankly rarely a rhyme or reason to it, any number of factors just combine with chance and luck to make it happen. For Hathaway, there was the online backlash against her being considered for the role of Catwoman instead of other fanboy favorite actresses, and that caused a steady stream of hate for months, and I think that was a big part of setting off the trend. Then the media talked on and off about the supposed hate, and some of the longer-term Hathaway haters chimed in accusing her of being phoney etc, and that got traction when gossip sites and others kept the story alive, and like any narrrative that takes hold at a given time for some reasons that aren't always clear, this one kept spreading around online and getting repeated until people took it as a truth that there's some big anti-Hathaway sentiment among the broad public -- which there probably is now, because everyone kept repeating it and jumping aboard.",0

With the exception of Les Miserables where they chopped her hair off made her look dirty and gave her a British accent to force the difference.,"To those factors I'd add a really important one that has to be considered, too -- people have totally different and contradicting standards by which they judge actresses and actors, and those standards are particularly skewed against young actresses. Few people ever ask the kinds of questions or make the kinds of demands of male actors as they do female actors. A young male actor who is handsome, talented, comes from a family with a history of acting, and who tries to smile a lot and acts nervous and gives speeches or comments that seem too self-serving or rehersed generally get treated like... well, they get treated just fine most of the time, so long as their smile is ""charming"" and they keep being ""handsome"" and ""talented."" Female actors who don't seem ""humble"" enough, however, get quickly labeled cold or stuck-up and other such things, because the attitude is that if a woman isn't humble enough then she's a b****. That's not just a myopic standard applied to actresses, either -- women in almost any profession get treated to similar accusations, and sadly even other women are likely to apply those standards (we're all socialized and educated etc in the same world, after all, so behaviors and attitudes and expectations spread everywhere).",0

That's all, and obviously it's not rationally a basis for any reasonable person to think they have remotely enough experience or information to make a serious informed, intelligent assessment of Hathaway as a human being, unless she turned to the camera and said, ""Minorities should be segregated,"" or some other such actual assertion of morality that speaks to her personality more.",0

And when people get bored insisting they hate someone they've never met just because her smiles and nice comments don't seem ""true"" enough to them, and/or because she's famous & popular but doesn't act humble enough about it. Or rather, her constant expressions of having a severe self-esteem problem and fear of failure (including self-consciousness about her weight, about bad relationship history, and about comparisons to her mother's expectations) seem ""fake"" and so she's not REALLY humble enough, and is therefore according to her haters fake, unlikeable, stuck-up, etc. That much animosity for pretty much no good reason is hard to maintain, and so Hathaway's redemption will come eventually (maybe soon, since it's peaking right now with her Oscar win and her shocking delivery of a prepared speech at an award ceremony without enough genuine-seeming humility).",0

Or she might really care about the issues she's involved with such as gay rights (her brother came out of the closet to her and her family when she was young, resulting in Hathaway changing her religious association), and she might really be nice and might want to be well-liked but might be better at acting on a stage than being herself in front of a room full of people who expect her to act humble lest she be called a cold stuck-up b****. Some people are more comfortable being themselves than others, some people find it easier to express their real feelings than others, some people find it easier to deliver prepared remarks about themselves easier than others. It'd be interesting if the people who hate Hathaway for supposedly being fake and stuck-up and not humble enough etc were to just film themselves for one week, 24 hours a day, and then see if they ever come off as fake or not approachable enough or not humble enough.

It’s not like she’s in the papers or always trying to get publicity like say Meghan Markle (Who claimed wanted privacy etc)! So I don’t think Anne Hathaway even deserves such a question being posted on quora or people discussing her in such a way? I imagine lots of people think public figures are public property and therefore they are entitled to give an opinion on them when they haven’t done anything controversial to deserve such a thing? Also lots of people are jealous as celebrities get more money and a better lifestyle than they do? Also lastly, good old fashioned sexism when women are always get criticised like ‘ how dare Madonna be over 60 and still dress this way why doesn’t she give up singing and move over for younger generation? How dare Cheryl Cole have dated Liam from one direction who’s more than 10 years younger than her what a cougar! Why doesn’t lady gaga lose weight if she’s going to dance on stage’, etc. It’s stupid and uncalled for! It’s not the same as say ‘how dare Justin Bieber spit on his fans, or Meghan Markle tell lecture others not to waste and think about climate change as she goes about on her private jets, or Amber heard trying to ruin Johnny depps career accusing him of violence when evidence shows she was also abusive etc",0

The men were mean too, but the women were particularly vindictive just because she didn't ""seem approachable"" or ""said hello"" when she first started. Word went round the company was that she was a stuck up beeyotch and a total snob. The truth was, she was scared shitless at starting somewhere new. When she eventually tried to reach out and build a relationship with some of the women, they shat on her even more - apparently it made her fake and annoying. It's hard to change the minds of others when they've already made up their mind about you and aren't willing to change it. It got to her for a bit and affected her work, so she told herself that she didn't care what they thought, she worked hard, loved her job and was excelling at it - she wasn't going to start apologising for her ability. What got her through the day(s) were: ""They hate me because I'm awesome."" Because, really, when everyone is working hard to bring you down, the only way you can stay standing is if you hold yourself up with some semblance of grace. Obviously this doesn't help her campaign in the slightest, the women are working even harder at tearing her to pieces with gossip and baseless complaints to her behaviour.",0

As well as running away from her initial Disney princess image? Intentionally diversifying yourself and your art takes work. Doing random shit to get attention does not.

There is also a difference between tweeting mean things to Donald Trump in 2012, when he was just a racist billionaire in his 60s and held no public office, and tweeting them to a 16-year-old. But that difference seems to have been hard for Teigen to see in 2012.",0

1392673515321581569,Chrissy Teigen is a bully and a bitch,"A backlash against Teigen has been mounting for a while now. No one can be declared “the internet’s funniest (and frankest) person” without courting overexposure. Moreover, Teigen’s status as one of Trump’s most vocal celebrity critics has made her a favorite target of the right-wing spectrum of the internet. (She’s been extensively harassed by QAnon followers.) So hisses of incipient anger have been brewing around her every post for years.",0
1392673515321581569,Chrissy Teigen is a bully and a bitch,"In 2017, the popular celebrity gossip blogger Nicki Swift put together a video called “Shady Things About Chrissy Teigen Everyone Just Ignores.” Many of the offenses listed in the video are fairly benign, like Teigen’s tendency to discuss her and her husband’s sex life in more detail than a lot of other celebs would offer. But some of them tellingly foreshadowed the tweets to Stodden that would resurface in 2021: Teigen calling then-22-year-old Teen Mom star Farrah Abraham “a whore” who “everyone hates” in 2013; Teigen writing of then-9-year-old Quvenzhané Wallis in 2013, “i am forced to like quvenzhané wallis because she is a child right? okay fine.”",0
1392673515321581569,Chrissy Teigen is a bully and a bitch,"In October of 2020, the Chrissy Teigen backlash began to simmer. That month, Teigen suffered a stillbirth, one she announced publicly with black-and-white photos of herself in the throes of grief. Some onlookers jeered at the photos, arguing that they reduced a personal tragedy to a tacky bid for attention. “Chrissy Teigen is so distraught over her miscarriage that she took the time to pose for a photo of herself crying, in black and white for dramatic effect, then shared that photo with the world along with her words. Stop it,” said one commenter.",0
1392673515321581569,Chrissy Teigen is a bully and a bitch,"A counter-backlash eventually emerged in that case, with multiple outlets arguing that taking photographs can be an essential part of the grieving process for the parents of stillborn children and that Teigen’s public vulnerability could lessen the stigma surrounding pregnancy loss. Teigen herself turned the whole incident into the fodder for a raw and vulnerable Medium post later that month.",0
1392673515321581569,Chrissy Teigen is a bully and a bitch,"“I cannot express how little I care that you hate the photos,” Teigen wrote. “How little I care that it’s something you wouldn’t have done. I lived it, I chose to do it, and more than anything, these photos aren’t for anyone but the people who have lived this or are curious enough to wonder what something like this is like. These photos are only for the people who need them. The thoughts of others do not matter to me.”",0
1392673515321581569,Chrissy Teigen is a bully and a bitch,"The backlash died down, but it hadn’t been fully averted. In February 2021, Teigen started a Twitter prompt thread on an apparently anodyne subject — “what’s the most expensive thing you’ve eaten that you thought sucked?” — and paired it with a jokey anecdote about having once accidentally ordered a $13,000 bottle of wine. Her followers erupted into an eat-the-rich fury.",0

1392673515321581569,Chrissy Teigen is a bully and a bitch,"“Chrissy Teigen” began trending worldwide on Twitter, signifying that Teigen had become that day’s main character. “worst nightmare,” Teigen tweeted in response.",0
1392673515321581569,Chrissy Teigen is a bully and a bitch,"People were starting to get bored with Teigen, and it sure seemed like many of them were looking for any excuse to turn on her. Teigen was too savvy to the ways of the internet not to see it coming. In 2019, she told Vanity Fair she’d turned down an offer to host “a high-profile nighttime talk show” for fear of overexposure.",0
1392673515321581569,Chrissy Teigen is a bully and a bitch,"“It was just too much attention and focus on me,” she said. “It’s almost like the more things you do, the closer you are to getting canceled. It’s so scary to me — to have the world turn on you and hate you.”",0
1392673515321581569,Chrissy Teigen is a bully and a bitch,"Teigen is well aware of how cancellation works on Twitter. In 2020, she was central to the cancellation of food writer Alison Roman, who lost her New York Times column and (Teigen-produced) cooking show after criticizing Teigen and Marie Kondo in an interview for “selling out” with their product lines. Teigen publicly announced her hurt feelings, and the Alison Roman backlash took off.",0
1392673515321581569,Chrissy Teigen is a bully and a bitch,"In that case, Teigen accepted Roman’s apology and made a point of noting that she didn’t support the swarms of her followers who had attacked Roman. She added that she identified with Roman.",0
1392673515321581569,Chrissy Teigen is a bully and a bitch,"“I remember the exact time I realized I wasn’t allowed to say whatever popped in my head-that I couldn’t just say things in the way that so many of my friends were saying,” Teigen tweeted. “Before, I never really knew where I stood in the industry, in the world. Eventually, I realized that once the relatable ‘snarky girl who didn’t care’ became a pretty successful cookbook author and had more power in the industry, I couldn’t just say whatever the fuck I wanted. The more we grow, the more we get those wakeup calls.”",0
1392673515321581569,Chrissy Teigen is a bully and a bitch,"So Teigen could see her cancellation coming. But it wasn’t until May 2021, when Stodden revealed how Teigen had bullied them, and it became clear that Teigen had done something genuinely horrible and not just a little cringey, that her cancellation truly arrived.",0
1392673515321581569,Chrissy Teigen is a bully and a bitch,The targets of Teigen’s Twitter bullying were all people who the pop culture of the 2000s treated as acceptable targets,0
1392673515321581569,Chrissy Teigen is a bully and a bitch,"In the wake of Stodden’s video post, news outlets have unearthed other old Teigen tweets that, it is now clear, were in dismayingly bad taste. “Lindsay adds a few more slits to her wrists when she sees emma stone,” Teigen tweeted in 2011 of Lindsay Lohan, who has admitted to struggling with self-harm. Those Farrah Abraham tweets from 2013 that made the rounds in Nicki Swift’s 2017 video are now circulating again.",0
1392673515321581569,Chrissy Teigen is a bully and a bitch,"Teigen’s reputation-damaging tweets all share a certain essential DNA. They are all tweets mocking girls and femmes whom the pop culture of the late ’00s and early ’10s had made it clear were fair game for mockery: people who read as girls (Stodden did not come out as nonbinary until 2021), and whom the culture at large considered to be too trashy, too slutty, too showy. Girly, but not in the right way. (Not that there was a right way.)",0
1392673515321581569,Chrissy Teigen is a bully and a bitch,"What Teigen said on Twitter about and to those people was genuinely horrible, and it is clear that she targeted them because pop culture had given her permission to do so. Even outlets like Jezebel, “a supposedly feminist website,” were mocking Stodden in 2012. Doing so was part of the snarky ethos that defined Jezebel and its more famous cousin, Gawker.",0
1392673515321581569,Chrissy Teigen is a bully and a bitch,"So in the early ’10s, these tweets didn’t hurt Teigen. Instead, they were part of what made her seem real and funny. Then, as now, Twitter rewarded cruelty, as long as it was directed at those the in-group considered to be “the right people.” But then, unlike now, “the right people” could include teenagers trapped in abusive relationships with adults.",0
1392673515321581569,Chrissy Teigen is a bully and a bitch,"The attributes on display in the tweets that have led to Teigen’s downfall appear to be some of the same attributes that made Teigen so widely beloved for so long: her lack of filter, her love of roasting people widely agreed at the time to be terrible. What’s changed is that now, it’s clear that the way she wielded them was fundamentally misdirected.",0
1392673515321581569,Chrissy Teigen is a bully and a bitch,"Our great reckoning with how we talk about women and femmes over the course of the Me Too decade has changed the way Twitter works. And in the process, it’s bringing down the woman who used to rule it.",0
1392673515321581569,Chrissy Teigen is a bully and a bitch,"Update, June 14, 4:15 pm: This article has been updated to include Teigen’s June 14 apology post.",0
1392673515321581569,Chrissy Teigen is a bully and a bitch,"She probably had the same reaction I did—-total disgust that anyone would choose to bully a woman for sharing her devastating loss of their child and encouraging others to check on those who may be hurting also, especially in light of the pandemic. I have seen people criticizing her for talking about something they think should be kept “private,” while at the same time insisting there is no taboo associated with miscarriage. Others have bashed her for waiting months before talking about it. And then of course there are the conspiracy groupies who don’t believe she was ever pregnant and therefore could not have suffered a miscarriage. Some refuse to believe she had a miscarriage without “proof.” I guess this group needs before and after ultrasound films, hospital records, lab results, doctors’ reports, and probably graphic pictures. There are some who offer condolences, saying they believe it could have happened, but criticize her writing as “too dramatic,” suspiciously written like Finding Freedom, or even plagiarized.",0
1392673515321581569,Chrissy Teigen is a bully and a bitch,"So, yes, Chrissy, who recently shared her own story of loss, lost it. I don’t blame her. There is a segment of society who delights in gossip, innuendo, and conspiracy theories and are tabloid, gossip blog/vlog aficionados, and repeatedly share inaccurate, hate-filled “opinions” with others. Like many others, I just thought that common decency, basic humanity, and compassion might prevail—for once. I guess Chrissy felt the same way.",0

I can understand why people don’t like her. Chrissy Teigen says some very divisive statements. I don’t just mean her political statements. Her comments about Girl Scout cookies were despicable. I also notice in her crappy post, she didn’t put Samoa cookies which in my opinion are the best ever! The mint ones are good too. I guess taste is subjective though. I hate the whiny singing of her husband. GS cookies are for a good cause and it’s sad she wants to bring down young girls. She is completely ignorant and uneducated and even if you agree with her politics, she shouldn’t speak for all Americans. I also find her extremely unattractive and have no clue why she was ever a model. She needs to stop tweeting.",0

1392673515321581569,Chrissy Teigen is a bully and a bitch,She was cuter before she did all that cosmetic enhancement but she is still attractive. I just don’t care for her stridency. I get that no one in Hollywood likes Trump but there was a tweet she fired off to him directly awhile back that was so rude. I don’t think you necessarily have to like the president but you should show respect for the office. When all these celebrities get up on their high horse about Trump they don’t get it that it makes our whole country look bad when they are posting stuff on social media. I think it weakens how we look. I think it sends the message to other countries that our own citizens don’t respect the White House so feel free to do whatever you want to us. No matter how bad our president is (he might not be good but he’s 1000 times better than dictatorships in other countries and we are enjoying freedom and not running for our lives) I think openly disrespecting the office is low class and just not wise.,0
1392673515321581569,Chrissy Teigen is a bully and a bitch,If she was out here living amongst the commoners and not in her mansion with a bunch of sycophants around her I’m guessing she would’ve been told to sit down and shut it a long time ago. If she was unattractive very few would be giving her the time of day. Her looks are her only currency. She gets laughs which means attention which makes her “a thing” so people want to capitalize on that. She thinks it’s cause she’s so awesome but she’s really just getting used.,0
1392673515321581569,Chrissy Teigen is a bully and a bitch,I’m sure she feels like she is always right. You can tell by her smugness…if she was educated it might be a different story but she’s just a pretty face who got elevated for posing for SI and she is now acting like she’s on a “Lord of the Flies” Island.,0
1392673515321581569,Chrissy Teigen is a bully and a bitch,I wish people would stop glorifying ignorant people just because they happened to win the generic lottery and not because they’ve actually done something worthwhile on their own merit.

In the fourteen years he has held that title, he has brought honor to it. He hasn't just talked about housing the homeless, he has built houses for them with his own hands and has inspired and organized others to do likewise. He hasn't just talked about comforting the afflicted, he has mounted a little known program through the Carter Center that is well on its way to eradicating Guinea worm disease, a painful, crippling parasite that has inflicted suffering on millions of Africans. He hasn't just talked about extending democracy, he has put his reputation and sometimes his very life on the line in country after country often with little or no publicity, to promote free elections and expose rigged ones. And, of course, most controversially, he hasn't just talked about peace, he has made peace, or made peace possible, by using his moral prestige and his willingness to take risks and his persistence and his patience and his stubbornness to bring hostile parties that extra little distance that sometimes makes the difference between war and not-war.....",0

Carter's inteference--combined, of course, with President Clinton's determination to use force if necessary--turned what would have been a bloody invasion with casualites and bitterness on all sides into a peaceful and apparently quite successful occupation. Carter was roundly attacked for his efforts, and some of the attacks seemed valid on the surface. A lot of people were outraged that Carter treated Haiti's military strongman, Lieutenant Raoul Cedras, with respect and called him a man of honor. A lot of people were outraged that Cedras and his henchmen initilly were permitted to remain in Haiti and allowed to keep some of their ill-gotten financial gains. A lot of people were outraged that at one point Carter said he was ashamed of his country for the way it had treated Haiti over the years. A lot of people were outraged that Carter, in defiance of official State Department policy, allowed the puppet president of Haiti to sign the agreement, thus seeming to give legitimacy to an essentially criminal regime. And, of course, a lot of people were outraged, or maybe just baffled, that Carter kept talking about how slender and attractive Mrs. Cedras was.

Clearly, this was one of those times when modesty and reticence would have been the most effective form of boasting. But he didn't do that. He went on television and talked and talked, and ended up saying some rather graceless and foolish things. The result was that he ended up reminding a lot of people of what they had never liked about him--the self-righteousness, the assumption of moral superiority--and quite thoroughly taking the shine off his triumph....",0

His critics recalled that as President, he toasted the Shah of Iran and the authoritarian rulers of the Philippines and South Korea, described Marshal Tito of Yugoslavia, improbably, as one of his ""best friends,"" and, at the SALT II signing ceremony in Vienna, embraced Leonid Brezhnev and kissed the startled apparatchik on both cheeks. But these gestures spoke not to any admiration for tyrants but to a Christian eagerness to redeem sinners--and, as in the later case of Cedras and the Serbs, a not-so-Christian willingness to manipulate the emotions of his negotiating partners. In practice, Carter has always showed himself as ready to anger authoritarians as to flatter them, in pursuit of peace and human rights....",0

Carter the President was pragmatic, probably a little too pragmatic for the times. He encouraged energy conservation and recognized early on that the dependence on Arab oil was a very dangerous precept.
 
He also ended detent with the Soviets when they invaded Afghanistan and understood the necessity of not negotiating with terrorists.
 
  Overall, I would say yes. His refusal to go along with his own party (he vetoed his own people 17 times) is a good example of a man who realized how important independence in the White House was.",0

Carter was correct in believing that our reliance on Middle Eastern oil was the main reason behind the 70s stagflation. He also was correct in believing that oil dependency in and of itself is incredibly harmful to the environment.

Jon Stewart, then at the height of his Daily Show fame, appeared on CNN’s Crossfire, told the hosts they were ruining the country, and singled out Carlson in particular as a “dick.” Crossfire limped along for three more months before being canceled. Carlson then spent the next four years in the wilderness, appearing on Dancing With the Stars and hosting Tucker, which was canceled for low ratings in early 2008, on MSNBC, still a year or two away from deciding it would be the liberal cable news network. In 2003, a fresh-faced 34-year-old Carlson had released a memoir, Politicians, Partisans, and Parasites, which cataloged and celebrated his meteoric rise through the burgeoning world of cable news.

And here’s the difference: The ones that failed refused to put accuracy first. This is the hard truth that conservatives need to deal with. I’m as conservative as any person in this room—I’m literally in the process of stockpiling weapons and food and moving to Idaho, so I am not in any way going to take a second seat to anyone in this room ideologically.” Watching the clip today, one can feel Carlson’s agitation; trained in the measured pace of TV speak—speaking too slowly makes you seem dumb, while speaking too quickly makes you seem nervous—he is talking at a speed somewhere between Lionel Messi and Usain Bolt. “If you create a news organization whose primary objective is not to deliver accurate news, you will fail,” Carlson said, his voice building to crescendo. “The New York Times is a liberal paper … but it’s also a paper that cares about whether they spell people’s names right; it’s a paper that cares about accuracy.

The outrageous things he says during his show quickly spread on Twitter. They’re blogged about as proof of just how deranged the right has become on any number of issues—crime, immigration, race, vaccines, education, health care. Often, Carlson turns that outrage into fodder for the next night’s program—a cycle resembling the one Trump rode to the White House with his rallies in 2016. The transformation of The Daily Caller is the Rosetta Stone moment of Carlson’s career, a period during which he learned his lesson. He never sought respectability again. But his journey to the top of conservative media began with that CPAC speech. There has always been a nastiness and racial grievance at the core of Carlson, but, for much of his early career, he also sought a degree of respectability. At the time, there was still a somewhat respectable conservative media in existence. Carlson’s wobbly ascent in right-wing media eerily reflects the gradual stripping away of that respectability, as well as its increasing radicalization. “You could argue that Tucker Carlson’s career has been a Tour de France of conservative media. He has literally hit all the stations of the cross,” former conservative blogger Matthew Sheffield told me. “But all that’s changed is the object of his cruelty. Whereas before he was more of an Atlas Shrugged kind of guy—screw the poor. Now he’s decided to change the focus to let’s keep out these goddamned minorities.” A year after his CPAC speech, Carlson would take a stab at creating the type of hard news–focused outlet he described. When he launched The Daily Caller in 2010, he vowed that it would “primarily be a news site” with a straightforward approach to the news: “Find out what’s happening and tell you about it. We plan to be accurate, both in the facts we assert and in the conclusions we imply.”",0

They had 4 yrs but expect Biden to have it solved in 3 months.,"Tucker Swanson McNear Carlson was born in San Francisco in 1969. He was the older of two sons. (Carlson’s brother is named Buckley Swanson Peck Carlson, which suggests the family’s conservative bona fides.) His father, Dick, was a newsman turned banker turned politician, with a penchant for the kinds of red meat culture war stories his son would one day adopt: In 1976, at the end of his career as a self-described “gonzo reporter,” he outed Renée Richards, a trans tennis player who was applying to play in the U.S. Open as a woman. He would go on to lead Voice of America, the U.S. propaganda network, at the tail end of the Cold War. Carlson’s mother, Lisa, abandoned the family when Tucker was six, an event he rarely speaks of. “There’s almost nothing I like less than people who whine about their childhood,” Carlson told GQ, the closest he’s come to opening up. “The majority of successful people I know had childhood trauma.” Four years later, when Carlson was 10, his father married Patricia Swanson, an heiress to the Swanson TV dinner fortune. While at boarding school in Rhode Island, Carlson would meet his future wife, the daughter of the headmaster—the two are still married and have four children—and adopt his signature preppy style of a bow tie and blazer. His boarding school career was, by his own telling and everyone else’s, unremarkable but for one feature: He discovered debate and put it before everything else. Near the end of his time at the school, Carlson supposedly challenged any member of the faculty to debate him; no one accepted. Carlson then shipped off to Connecticut’s Trinity College, where he claims to have spent most of his time drunk. But this was the first PC era on campus, and, though an unremarkable student, Carlson was something of a conservative star. He thrilled at pissing off the hippies and lefties protesting on campus. When it was time to list his clubs and organizations in the school’s yearbook, Carlson cited membership in the nonexistent Dan White Society—a tribute to the murderer of Harvey Milk, the openly gay San Francisco politician of the 1970s—and the Jesse Helms Foundation (which does exist). “His personality was not similar to what it is now; it was exactly the same,” his college roommate (and future Daily Caller co-founder) Neil Patel said in 2017. Already apparent then were the twin pillars of Carlson’s career in conservative media. On the one hand, there is conservative pedigree: the bow tie, the well-heeled family, the debates. On the other, a fratty, trolly, attention-seeking side. Carlson’s journalism career began on the respectable side of conservative journalism. He started out working for Policy Review, the journal then housed inside the Heritage Foundation, where he wrote sober, plodding pieces about conservative policy issues: the decline of Black public schools, the benefits of a private police force, and “HOW TO CLOSE DOWN A CRACK HOUSE IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD.” Carlson was, at this point, on the Buckley track. “I was impressed by the quality of his mind,” former Policy Review editor Adam Meyerson said. “We talked about C.S. Lewis, Whittaker Chambers, Nicaragua, and he had a contagious enthusiasm about ideas.”",0
1384315537811988480,If you don’t think Sean Hannity is a propaganda whore - he has Trump on talking about the border. They had 4 yrs but expect Biden to have it solved in 3 months.,"After a brief sojourn as an op-ed writer at the Little Rock–based Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Carlson joined the nascent Weekly Standard, the Murdoch-owned opinion journal whose early staff also included David Brooks. Carlson told The Washington Post in 1999 that he “begged” friends and colleagues to persuade Weekly Standard editor William Kristol to hire him. He was also in contention for a position at the Clinton conspiracy–obsessed American Spectator, but he worried he would “be written off as a wing nut” if he accepted a job there. His career quickly took off. Much of Carlson’s Weekly Standard work is witty but doctrinaire—gossipy dispatches from Clinton’s scandal-plagued second term and Newt Gingrich’s sputtering speakership. In Carlson’s first Weekly Standard piece, “MUMIA DEAREST,” which appeared in the Standard’s first issue, he contacts a number of celebrities and activists who were calling for a new trial for Mumia Abu-Jamal, the political activist who was sentenced to death for killing a police officer in 1982. In that piece, Abu-Jamal’s liberal supporters—people like Gloria Steinem, Molly Ivins, Roger Ebert, and Ben & Jerry’s founder Ben Cohen—are rendered dupes, people who don’t know the first thing about the person they’re defending. MOVE, the Black radical organization whose headquarters was bombed, is mocked as “the black nationalist cult best known for getting blown up by the Philly police in 1985.” But interspersed are the pieces that made Carlson’s reputation and turned him, practically overnight, into a star. His 1996 profile of future Crossfire co-host James Carville is the gold standard: a sly and devastating hit piece. Dubbed a “populist plutocrat,” Carlson’s Carville is, above all else, a hypocrite and a poseur: a craven check-casher who cares primarily about lining his own pockets and sucking down expensive wines. And yet, Carville is also oddly sympathetic—one senses Carlson recognizes a fellow traveler, another rakish opportunist who just happens to be playing for the other side. In these pieces, we see the nucleus of Carlson’s later persona: He cares not one iota for public policy; what gets his blood up is hypocrisy, particularly when it comes from women, people of color, and LGBTQ people. He continued writing for The Weekly Standard but became one of the most sought-after long-form magazine writers in the country, publishing pieces for Esquire, The New York Times Magazine, and, later, The New Republic.",0
1384315537811988480,If you don’t think Sean Hannity is a propaganda whore - he has Trump on talking about the border. They had 4 yrs but expect Biden to have it solved in 3 months.,"Carlson described his break into TV as a lucky one: “If O.J. Simpson hadn’t murdered his wife, I probably wouldn’t be working in television,” he wrote. CBS needed pundits to cover the O.J. trial, and Carlson answered the call; he quickly became a cable news regular, before hosting his own debate show on CNN with liberal Bill Press, beginning in 2000. That show was a disaster—Carlson was still figuring out what worked on TV—and it was quickly canceled. But the bow-tied Carlson had found a home at CNN, which quickly slotted him in as the fratty, well-heeled Republican on Crossfire, where he would shout at liberals Paul Begala and James Carville every afternoon. Carlson, as ever, understood the assignment: He was there to bark and bicker and to gleefully represent Team Red. In 2003, not long before Stewart destroyed Crossfire, a 34-year-old Carlson published a memoir, Politicians, Partisans, and Parasites: My Adventures in Cable News. The book is a slight and sometimes funny portrait of how cable television works: Conflict is good, intelligence is bad. Its epigraph is Larry King’s advice for succeeding on TV: “The trick is to care, but not too much. Give a shit—but not really.” Carlson buys it whole cloth, pitching himself as someone almost giddy at the prospect of nightly debate, even if he doesn’t actually care about what’s at stake. “Nuance, needless to say, is the enemy of clear debate,” he writes. Later, he notes that “television magnifies almost everything about a person”—an interesting revelation from someone whose entire TV character was built around pompousness. Carlson was, to an extent, playing a character, but it was one nearing its death. He was the blue-blooded, country club Republican; a khakis-wearing suburb-dweller who cares about national defense and marginal tax rates. The GOP establishment was transforming—but Carlson didn’t realize it yet. Stewart’s disemboweling of Crossfire is arguably more well-known than the program itself at this point. The Daily Show host’s ultimate argument—that the series was “hurting America” by injecting partisanship into everything—stands today as both prescient and a tad naïve. By 2004, Crossfire’s weaponized partisanship had spread well beyond CNN; there was no turning back the clock to an era of sober, reasoned political debate on cable television. But what stands out now when one watches the clip is something different. “Real anger is as rare on television as real discussion,” The New York Times’s Alessandra Stanley wrote about Stewart’s appearance at the time. Stewart is actually very angry; Carlson, Begala, and Carville mostly just fumble around. Faced with real anger and real debate, they have nothing to offer. Carlson is revealed as just another phony—the exact kind of person Carlson the magazine writer would have skewered. Thus began Carlson’s time in the political wilderness. He was, during this stretch, still very much a member of the Beltway Establishment. But he quickly realized that the country club, GOP establishment shtick wasn’t working. He ditched the bow tie. He rebranded himself as an Iraq War critic and a kind of libertarian. He appeared on Dancing With the Stars in 2006 and was voted off almost immediately. He got a show on MSNBC, Tucker, that was forgettable and utterly conventional—Carlson’s guests were, by and large, familiar politicos. It was canceled in March 2008, less than four years after the Stewart incident, and no one seemed to miss it.",0

They had 4 yrs but expect Biden to have it solved in 3 months.,"Carlson appeared to have nowhere to go. Speaking to The Hill in 2008, he joked about being unemployed but largely came across as lost. “His ideal next step is to host Jeopardy! and a Sunday politics show,” Betsy Rothstein wrote. “I’m open to everything,” Carlson said. “Something interesting always happens.” During this period, Carlson’s meanness began to warp into cruelty. His racism and homophobia, long parts of his journalistic oeuvre, became even more pronounced. As he ditched the establishment GOP cloak, he leaned more and more heavily into his fratty side. Television helped it along, of course. His last award-winning magazine feature, a 2003 Esquire piece about traveling to Liberia with a group of Black preachers, prefigures the types of arguments that would appear again and again on his show. “The idea that I’d be responsible for the sins (or, for that matter, share in the glory of the accomplishments) of dead people who happened to share my skin tone has always confused me,” Carlson wrote. “I grew up feeling about as much connection to nineteenth-century slave owners as I did to bus drivers in Helsinki or astronomers in Tirana. We’re all capable of getting sunburned. That’s it.” In his 2003 memoir, moreover, he names a woman who accused him of sexual assault in a Kentucky restaurant. (She later recanted; her lawyer did not respond to a request for comment.) Between 2006 and 2011, Carlson made numerous appearances on a radio show hosted by Bubba the Love Sponge, a Florida-based shock jock. Carlson repeatedly used racist and homophobic language. He lamented that “everyone’s embarrassed to be a white man” now, even though white men should get credit for “creating civilization and stuff.” Iraq, the invasion of which he had cheered on, was “a crappy place filled with a bunch of, you know, semiliterate primitive monkeys.” He questioned Barack Obama’s Blackness because he is of mixed-race parentage. He joked with Bubba about loving him “in a faggot way.” In another call, he joked about teen girls sexually experimenting at boarding school and referred to women as “pigs” and “whores.” Many of these comments surfaced much later, but Carlson also rarely bothered to hide them: In 2007, on his MSNBC show, he boasted about beating up a gay man who made an advance on him in a public bathroom. But Carlson still wanted to hold on to his place in the establishment—you don’t talk about hosting Jeopardy! or a Sunday show unless that place is secure. The Daily Caller represented a way back in. Carlson may have pitched it as a Times for the right, but it was closer in spirit to Brown’s recently launched Daily Beast or his sometime friend Arianna Huffington’s HuffPost. Its name, like Brown’s, recalled the gossipy English rags of old, though it lacked the literary élan of The Daily Beast, which takes its name from a fictional newspaper in an Evelyn Waugh novel: Here would be a muckraking, news-breaking outlet that would advance conservative priorities rather than liberal ones. The right, as Carlson said at CPAC, had been losing the arms race for years. Now, it could finally catch up. It also represented an attempt to create an establishment conservative media outlet in Carlson’s image: one less buttoned-up, more freewheeling and mercenary than your standard fare. Here would be a publication for conservatives like Carlson: sharp-elbowed, witty, and ideological, but without resorting to partisanship.",0

They had 4 yrs but expect Biden to have it solved in 3 months.,"The Daily Caller began practically as an outgrowth of the GOP. His co-founder, Neil Patel, was not only Carlson’s old college roommate but a former top aide to Dick Cheney. The site’s opinion editor was a former RNC press secretary. The whole thing was funded by Republican mega-donor Foster Friess. Carlson told Human Events that the site would be opposed to the Obama administration, which he said was behind “a radical increase in federal power ... a version of socialism.” But he also insisted to The Washington Post that he wasn’t going to be a cheerleader for the GOP. “Our goal is not to get Republicans elected,” he said. “Our goal is to explain what your government is doing. We’re not going to suck up to people in power, the way so many have. There’s been an enormous amount of throne-sniffing. It’s disgusting.” Friess, meanwhile, thought that his erstwhile partners would help remake America. “Tucker and Neil present a huge opportunity to re-introduce civility to our political discourse,” he told the Post. “They want to make a contribution to the dialogue that occurs in our country that has become too antagonistic, nasty and hostile.” The whole thing was a disaster. The site’s traffic was terrible; there wasn’t an audience for serious, independent, investigative-minded conservative journalism. Writing in Salon in 2012, Alex Pareene noted that this was wholly predictable. “Carlson’s Daily Caller was supposed to be a home for edgy, independent voices and serious, well-reported journalism from a conservative perspective,” Pareene wrote. “No one actually wants that—if they did, it would exist, right?—because the online right-wing audience simply wants to be told reassuring and outrageous lies.” And so the Caller quickly resorted to stunts. There were pranks, like buying keitholbermann.com and redirecting it to the site’s negative coverage of Olbermann’s MSNBC show. And there were a lot of photos of attractive, scantily clad women. “At first, The Daily Caller was trying to do more substantive reporting or analysis in opinion columns, but they weren’t getting coverage or numbers,” Matthew Sheffield told me. “So they started the side-boob beat to try to juice their numbers—it worked so well that they actually spun off that content into its own website.” The Daily Caller boosted its traffic with posts like “THESE PHOTOS OF KATE UPTON AS A SEXY HOUSEWIFE WILL BLOW YOUR MIND,” “EMILY RATAJKOWSKI USES HER HAND AS A BRA IN SCANDALOUS NEW PHOTO,” and “13 SYRIAN REFUGEES WE’D TAKE IMMEDIATELY,” a story that went on to note that the refugees were “Syria-sly hot.”",0
1384315537811988480,If you don’t think Sean Hannity is a propaganda whore - he has Trump on talking about the border. They had 4 yrs but expect Biden to have it solved in 3 months.,"The Caller’s journalism took a similar nosedive that began with a bogus, sensationalist exposé that would define Carlson’s bad faith approach to journalism going forward. In the summer of 2010, The Daily Caller pushed a delicious scoop: The nation’s journalists were engaged in a vast conspiracy and were colluding together on a private listserv, Journolist, to help define the news agenda for the nation and push the country to the left. The Daily Caller published story after story about how it had caught the journalists red-handed, that their correspondence proved they were a kind of cabal. The whole thing was a sensation; one Washington Post reporter, Dave Weigel, lost his job over emails he sent to the group, which included more than 400 journalists, economists, historians, and the like. (Weigel has since been rehired by the Post.) There were several problems, however. For one, the stories misrepresented a number of key details, making the findings appear much more sensational. The Daily Caller repeatedly pulled emails out of context to make them seem worse. The headline of one story claimed that the listserv wanted the government to “shut down Fox News,” something that the contents of the emails didn’t actually support. Most of the participants, moreover, were liberal journalists and commentators. The Caller hadn’t unearthed a secret society of buttoned-up Times reporters discussing how best to move the country toward anarcho-syndicalism. It had found liberal commentators like Ezra Klein (Journolist’s founder), Matt Yglesias, Spencer Ackerman, and Chris Hayes talking in a way you would expect them to (TNR editor Michael Tomasky was also a member). And then there was how the list was uncovered. Carlson had written to Klein to try to join; he was rebuffed. And so, The Daily Caller snuck on. Someone impersonated Max Brantley, the liberal Arkansas Democrat-Gazette journalist, and got added. (That person may very well have been former Democrat-Gazette employee Tucker Carlson.) The whole episode had much more in common with James O’Keefe’s bogus “stings” than it did with anything resembling the sterling journalism Carlson claimed he was after. From there, things didn’t get much better. The Daily Caller pushed birtherism, it published O’Keefe’s lesser videos, it portrayed Trayvon Martin as a thug. It tried to take down Media Matters and Bob Menendez with shoddy “scoops” that quickly fell apart. The site published several figures on the alt-right, and its deputy editor was forced to resign after it emerged he had written for a white supremacist publication under a pseudonym. The site was nothing like what Carlson claimed he intended it to be. But it flourished. And it also helped resuscitate his career. After years of seeking mainstream acceptance, Carlson stopped. But he did show a knack for driving the red meat culture war stories that fed the right-wing media ecosystem. And, in an era of growing frustration with RINOs and other Republican elites, Carlson also showed a knack for biting the hand that fed him—with one exception.",0
1384315537811988480,If you don’t think Sean Hannity is a propaganda whore - he has Trump on talking about the border. They had 4 yrs but expect Biden to have it solved in 3 months.,"“I have two rules,” Carlson said in 2015 after he killed a piece critical of Fox News. “One is you can’t criticize the families of the people who work here. And the other rule is you can’t go after Fox. Only for one reason, not because they’re conservative or we agree with them [or] because they’re doing the Lord’s work. Nothing like that. It’s because I work there. I’m an anchor on Fox.” In 2009, a year after his MSNBC show went up in flames, Carlson got another shot at Fox News—he began as a contributor and occasional guest host. His ascent was slow, but steady. By 2013, he was hosting Fox & Friends’ weekend hour. Three years later—eight years after his last bite at the apple—Carlson got his own show, not long after then-Fox News chief Roger Ailes brought him to the network. Over the last four years, as his Fox News show adopted more and more radical positions—vaccine skepticism, white nationalism, his growing support for illiberal and anti-democratic right-wing regimes around the world—many who were once in his orbit have wondered what happened to Tucker Carlson. That question has fueled countless magazine profiles and cocktail hour conversations. The answer is perhaps less exciting than the question seems. Carlson is, in many ways, the same as he has ever been. He is whiny and petulant. He insists that he is a rebel, shucking elites of both parties and decrying phonies and partisans. But he advocates again and again only on behalf of whites, particularly well-heeled ones. He contradicts himself constantly and seems to have no fixed ideology at all, beyond a sense of racial solidarity. “Ultimately, I’m just not a guilty white person,” Carlson wrote for Esquire in 2003. Over the ensuing two decades, he has only gotten angrier and angrier at the suggestion he should feel guilty for being white and more insistent that groups advocating for Blacks or homosexuals or anyone who isn’t white exist solely to take what is rightfully his and—as he insists frequently on his television show—yours. Carlson’s narrative is somewhat different from Trump’s. “In a weird way, Tucker isn’t just advocating on behalf of white genocide,” Media Matters president Angelo Carusone told me, referring to the widely held idea on the right that the white race is going to be replaced. “He’s also somebody who does weave in and blur the lines between white genocide and Americana genocide. That’s really his culture war: It’s not just white people and white culture that’s being addressed, but it’s also Americana. You can’t hang Norman Rockwell paintings anymore! It’s all that stuff.”",0

They had 4 yrs but expect Biden to have it solved in 3 months.,"Nothing exemplifies Carlson’s shtick quite like his repeated questioning of the purpose and efficacy of the Covid-19 vaccine. For Carlson, the vaccine is a potent metaphor for the creeping hegemony of Democratic elites. “Democrats believe vaccines are the answer to everything. ‘Shh. Don’t ask questions. Just take the shot,’” he told viewers late last year. At the same time, it is also an example of how elites police discourse to hold on to power. “From the moment that coronavirus vaccine arrived, the most powerful people in America worked to make certain that no one could criticize it,” he said in February. In July, Carlson compared vaccine passports to Jim Crow. Above all, Carlson portrays bad faith attacks as good faith inquiries, simple questions that should be answered by the powers that be. “Don’t dismiss those questions from anti-vaxxers,” Carlson said in March. “Don’t kick people off social media for asking them. Answer the questions.” And: “It turns out there are things we don’t know about the effects of this vaccine—and all vaccines, by the way. It’s always a trade-off.” Carlson is raising concerns with little basis in fact under the guise of asking legitimate questions. The answers to these inquiries exist. Carlson simply pretends they don’t. The result is a mendacious muddle, in which only one conclusion can be drawn: The elites are hiding something—likely something very sinister—from everyone else. Only Carlson has the courage to state plainly what’s under everyone’s nose. To his credit, he has focused more aggressively on the perils of economic concentration and military intervention and occupation than many of his colleagues at Fox—or his compatriots on the right—have. Many saw Trump’s rise as an opportunity: Here was someone gleefully in tune with the anger of large swaths of the country, but who struggled to come up with a coherent ideological vision beyond demagoguery and reaction. Carlson is skilled at finding targets for that anger, whether they be school board members or female journalists, and directing his viewers’ attention there. If you want to know who is destroying America, tune in to Tucker Carlson Tonight. Carlson is practically millenarian. His obnoxious, fratty persona in his early television days and early writing career has given way to something shriller. Carlson hectors. He tilts his head, adopting a look of disappointment like a confused golden retriever that, having become used to prime rib, is suddenly given kibble. He remains boyish, but has gotten puffy and bloated; he squints. Above all, he’s pissed off at what they are doing to you.",0

They had 4 yrs but expect Biden to have it solved in 3 months.,"The Sapphire Caricature portrays black women as rude, loud, malicious, stubborn, and overbearing.1 This is the Angry Black Woman (ABW) popularized in the cinema and on television. She is tart-tongued and emasculating, one hand on a hip and the other pointing and jabbing (or arms akimbo), violently and rhythmically rocking her head, mocking African American men for offenses ranging from being unemployed to sexually pursuing white women. She is a shrill nagger with irrational states of anger and indignation and is often mean-spirited and abusive. Although African American men are her primary targets, she has venom for anyone who insults or disrespects her. The Sapphire's desire to dominate and her hyper-sensitivity to injustices make her a perpetual complainer, but she does not criticize to improve things; rather, she criticizes because she is unendingly bitter and wishes that unhappiness on others. The Sapphire Caricature is a harsh portrayal of African American women, but it is more than that; it is a social control mechanism that is employed to punish black women who violate the societal norms that encourage them to be passive, servile, non-threatening, and unseen.",0

They had 4 yrs but expect Biden to have it solved in 3 months.,"From the 1800s through the mid-1900s, black women were often portrayed in popular culture as ""Sassy Mammies"" who ran their own homes with iron fists, including berating black husbands and children. These women were allowed, at least symbolically, to defy some racial norms. During the Jim Crow period, when real blacks were often beaten, jailed, or killed for arguing with whites, fictional Mammies were allowed to pretend-chastise whites, including men. Their sassiness was supposed to indicate that they were accepted as members of the white family, and acceptance of that sassiness implied that slavery and segregation were not overly oppressive. A well-known example of a Sassy Mammy was Hattie McDaniel, a black actress who played feisty, quick-tempered mammies in many movies, including Judge Priest (Wurtzel & Ford, 1934), Music is Magic (Stone & Marshall, 1935), The Little Colonel (DeSylva & Butler, 1935), Alice Adams (Berman & Stevens, 1935), Saratoga (Hyman & Conway, 1937), The Mad Miss Manton (Wolfson & Jason, 1938), and Gone With the Wind (Selznick & Fleming, 1939).

The show was conceived by Freeman Gosden and Charles Correll, two white actors who portrayed the characters Amos Jones and Andy Brown by mimicking and mocking black behavior and dialect. At its best, Amos 'n' Andy was a situational comedy; at its worse, it was an auditory minstrel show.2 The show, with a mostly-white cast, aired on the radio from 1928 to 1960, with intermittent interruptions. The television version of the show, with network television's first all-black cast, aired on CBS from 1951-53, with syndicated reruns from 1954 to 1966. It was removed, in large part, through the efforts of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the civil rights movement. Both as a radio show3 and television show, Amos 'n' Andy was extremely popular, and this was unfortunate for African Americans because it popularized racial caricatures of blacks. Americans learned that blacks were comical, not as actors but as a race.",0

Many of the stories revolved around Kingfish, a get-rich-quick schemer and a con artist who avoided work, and, when possible, took financial advantage of the ignorance and naivete of Andy and others (see, for example, the episode Kingfish Sells a Lot).

She was the Bible-swinging, angry nemesis and sister-in-law of the main character, Fred. Theirs was a love-mostly hate relationship. Fred would call Aunt Esther ugly and she would call him a ""fish-eyed fool,"" an ""old sucka,"" or a ""beady-eyed heathen."" Then, they would threaten to hit each other. Aunt Esther dominated her husband Woodrow, a mild-mannered alcoholic. In this latter relationship, you have the idea of the aggressive black woman dominating a weak, morally defective black man.",0

They had 4 yrs but expect Biden to have it solved in 3 months.,"The situational comedy Good Times aired between 1974 and 1979 on the CBS television network. The show followed the life of the Evans family in a Chicago housing project modeled on the infamous Cabrini-Green projects. This was one of the first times that a poor family had been highlighted in a weekly television series. Episodes of Good Times dealt with the Evans' attempts to survive despite living in suffocating poverty. There were several racial caricatures on the show, most notably the son, James Evans Jr. (also called J.J.), who devolved into a Coon-like minstrel. After the first season the episodes increasingly focused on J.J.'s stereotypically buffoonish behavior. Esther Rolle, the actress who played the role of Florida Evans, the mother, expressed her dislike for J.J.'s character in a 1975 interview with Ebony magazine: ""He's eighteen and he doesn't work. He can't read or write. He doesn't think. The show didn't start out to be that...Little by little-with the help of the artist, I suppose, because they couldn't do that to me -- they have made J.J. more stupid and enlarged the role. Negative images have been slipped in on us through the character of the oldest child.""(""Bad Times"" 1975) In black-themed situational comedies when there is a Coon character there is often a Sapphire character to mock him. In Good Times a character that bantered with and mocked J.J. was his sister, Thelma. A clearer example of a Sapphire, however, was the neighbor, Willona Woods, though she rarely targeted J.J. Instead, Willona belittled Nathan Bookman, the overweight superintendent, and she put down a series of worthless boyfriends, an ex-husband, politicians, and other men with questionable morals and work ethics.",0

The Jeffersons, which aired from 1975 to 1985, focused on an upper-middle class family that had climbed up from the working class -- in the show's theme song there is the line, ""We finally got a piece of the pie."" George and Louise Jefferson were making so much money from their dry-cleaning businesses that they hired a housekeeper, Florence Johnston. Her relationship with George was often antagonistic and the back-talking, wisecracking, housekeeper approximated a Sapphire.

They had 4 yrs but expect Biden to have it solved in 3 months.,"The film genre called blaxploitation emerged in the early 1970s. These movies, which targeted urban black audiences, exchanged one set of racial caricatures -- Mammy, Tom, Uncle, Picanninny -- for a new set of equally offensive racial caricatures -- Bucks (sex-crazed deviants) Brutes, (pimps, hit-men, and dope peddlers), and Nats (Whites-haters). One old caricature, the Jezebel, was revamped. The portrayal of African American women as hyper-sexual temptresses was as old as American slavery, but during the blaxploitation period the Jezebel caricature and the Sapphire caricature merged into a hybrid: angry ""whores"" fighting injustice. Black actresses such as Pam Grier built careers starring in blaxploitation movies. Their characters resembled those of the black male superheroes: they were physically attractive and aggressive rebels, willing and able to use their bodies, brains, and guns to gain revenge against corrupt officials, drug dealers, and violent criminals. Their anger was not focused solely, or primarily, at black men; rather, it was focused at injustice and the perpetuators of injustice.",0

This is evident by the words of Cal Thomas, a commentator for FOX Television: ""Look at the image of angry black women on television. Politically you have Maxine Waters of California, liberal Democrat. She's always angry every time she gets on television. Cynthia McKinney, another angry black woman. And who are the black women you see on the local news at night in cities all over the country. They're usually angry about something. They've had a son who has been shot in a drive-by shooting. They are angry at Bush. So you don't really have a profile of non-angry black women, of whom there are quite a few.""(""Transcript: Fox"", 2008) Thomas, admittedly an untrained sociologist, expressed what many Americans see and internalize, namely, images of Sapphires: angry at black men, white men, white women, the federal government, racism, maybe life itself. Thomas, shortly after making his statements about black women, agreed with a co-panelist that Oprah Winfrey is not angry.",0

A Google search of Angry Black Women or ABW will demonstrate how pervasive this caricature has become. She lives in most movies with an all-black or predominantly black cast. For example, there is Terri, cussing and insulting the ""manhood"" of black men in Barbershop (Brown, Teitel, Tillman & Story, 2002) and its sequel, Barbershop 2 (Gartner, Teitel, Tillman & Sullivan, 2004). There is the augmentative Angela in Why Did I Get Married (Cannon & Perry, 2007). There is clip art of an angry black woman at www.clipartof.com/details/clipart/16467.html. The clip art description reads, ""Royalty-free people clipart picture image of an angry african american woman in a purple dress and heels, standing with her arms crossed and tapping her foot with a stern expression on her face. She could be mad at her child, a colleague or husband."" There are stock pictures of angry black women, such as those at www.inmagine.com/bld108/bld108498-photo. There are books devoted to angry black women, for example, The Angry Black Woman's Guide to Life (Millner, Burt-Murray, & Miller, 2004), and Web sites such as http://angryblackbitch.blogspot.com/where you can buy Angry Black Bitch cups, shirts, pillows, tile coasters, aprons, mouse pads, and Teddy Bears.

They had 4 yrs but expect Biden to have it solved in 3 months.,"The tabloid talk shows that became popular in the 1990s: The Jerry Springer Show, The Jenny Jones Show, The Maury Povich Show, and The Ricki Lake Show, helped reinforce the racial stereotypes of African Americans, including the stereotype of black women as angry, castrating shrews. By the early 2000s, the ""Trash Talk"" shows had receded in popularity, in part because of the emergence of so-called ""Reality Shows."" Again, these shows served as vehicles for African American women to be portrayed as Sapphires. Vanessa E. Jones, from the Boston Globe, wrote of the Sapphire: ""You see elements of her in Alicia Calaway of ""Survivor: All-Stars,"" who indulged in a temperamental bout of finger wagging during an argument in 2001's ""Survivor: The Australian Outback."" Coral Smith, who rules with an iron tongue on MTV's ""Real World/Road Rules Challenge: The Inferno,"" browbeat one female cast mate so badly a week ago that she challenged Smith to a fight. Then there's Omarosa Manigault-Stallworth of ""The Apprentice,"" who rode the angry-black-woman stereotype to the covers of People and TV Guide magazines even as she made fellow African-American businesswomen wince.""(Jones, 2004) Omarosa Manigault-Stallworth gained a great deal of national disdain and celebrity as a contestant on The Apprentice, Donald Trump's reality show. Manigault-Stallworth, who is almost always referred to by the single name Omarosa, was portrayed (and intentionally acted) as a cross between a Jezebel -- a hypersexual flirt and seductress -- and a bitter, aggressive Sapphire. Lorien Olive (2008), a political blogger, theorized on how white people saw Omarosa: ""At least among white people, she was interpreted in various ways as conniving, lazy, selfish, a sham, overly-ambitious, uppity, ungrateful, and paranoid. I guess I was always less interested in whether Omarosa was actually any of those things or whether it was simply an effect of the distortion of the editing of reality television. I was more interested in the fact that Omarosa seemed to stand for something bigger in the eyes of many white people. Her constant accusations of racism directed toward her fellow contestants and the fact that she wore her alienation and distrust of her team-mates on her sleeve opened up a whole world of racial speculation and ridicule. I would say debate, but in all of my internet travels, I haven't found much of anyone who wanted to go out on a limb for Omarosa. The fact that so many white people felt justified in their hatred for Omarosa (a hatred that could be passed of as a benign over-investment in a guilty pleasure: a reality TV series) is telling. She became the symbol of everything that went wrong in the post-Civil Rights Era: paranoid ""reverse racism""; the ungrateful and undeserving product of affirmative action; the ""uppity"" Black person who puts on airs; the beautiful, hyper-sexualized Black woman who pulled the wool over the powerful white man's eyes."" Olive next makes a connection that many others are making on Internet sites, namely, that First Lady Michelle Obama is the new Omarosa: a bitter, selfish, uppity, ungrateful, overly-ambitious Sapphire. One of the derisive nicknames for Michelle Obama is ""Omarosa Obama."" This demonstrates how the Sapphire caricature has broadened from an emasculating hater of black men to a bitter woman who hates anyone who displeases her.",0

To use sociological jargon, this is an example of an in-group virtue becoming an out-group vice. According to the blogger abagond (2008), ""Where white women are said to be 'independent,' black women are said to be 'emasculating,' robbing their men of their sense of manhood. Where white women are said to be standing up for themselves, black women are seen as wanting a fight. And so on. The same actions are read differently."" Being an articulate foe of injustice may be seen as a praise-worthy trait among whites; however, black women with similar traits may be seen as bitter, selfish complainers.",0

They had 4 yrs but expect Biden to have it solved in 3 months.,"Michelle Obama challenges the scripts that many Americans have for African American women. She is the antithesis of the Mammy caricature. The traditional portrayal of Mammy looked something like this: an obedient, loyal domestic servant, who cared more for the family members of her employer than she did for her own family; overweight and desexualized; and, most important to the portrait: not a threat to the social order. Michelle Obama is a Harvard-trained attorney, a conscientious mother, physically attractive, and she critiques and challenges the culture. She also does not fit the Jezebel image or its modern variant: the butt-shaking Hoogie Mama -- though FOX News tried to imply this when they referred to her in text as Senator Obama's ""Baby Mama."" Michelle Obama is not a Tragic Mulatto; she is a dark-skinned woman actively involved in civil rights and community activism. The so-called Tragic Mulatto was ashamed of her African heritage; Michelle Obama embraces her African American heritage and expresses her dissatisfaction with racial injustice.",0

They had 4 yrs but expect Biden to have it solved in 3 months.,"So, if she does not fit one of the three dominant historical caricatures of African American women, what imagery is left? Ideally, she would be judged on her individual traits and not as a one-dimensional stereotype; however, there is little ideal about patterns of race relations in this country. Racial stereotyping, too often, is a convenient way to pigeonhole others into categories that make sense to us. Instead of allowing Michelle Obama to be central to a new cultural narrative of black women (and the black family) there is a growing tendency to view Michelle Obama's words and behaviors as examples of the black woman as Sapphire. When she said, while speaking at a Milwaukee, Wisconsin political rally, ""for the first time in my adult life I am proud of my country because it feels like hope is finally making a comeback,"" she was accused of being an unpatriotic, ungrateful, and angry radical. In this portrait, she is more Pam Grier (sans the gun and the hypersexuality) than Sapphire Stevens; her supposed bitterness and hatred are directed toward her country -- and implicitly its white citizens -- and not toward black men. Finally, there was a label to stick to her. According to Erin Aubry Kaplan (2008), a journalist and blogger:> ""It's worth noting how Michelle was admired as long as she filled the prescription of a successful black woman on paper -- college grad, married to an equally successful black man, a working but attentive mother, financially secure, immaculately turned out. But as soon as she began revealing herself as a person and airing her views a bit, she began shape-shifting in the public eye into another kind of black woman altogether: angry, obstinate, mouthy -- a stereotypical harpy lurking in all black women that a friend of mine calls 'Serpentina.' The consternation about Michelle suggested an old racist sentiment that you can take the girl out of the ghetto, but you can never take the ghetto out of the girl."" Sean Hannity, Bill O'Reilly, Rush Limbaugh, Laura Ingraham and other conservative talkshow hosts rushed to paint her as the ultimate angry black woman, and they wondered aloud what she had to be angry about. Not all the lambasting came from white Americans. Mychal Massie (2008), chairman of the National Leadership Network of Black Conservatives-Project 21 -- a conservative black think tank, said: ""I find it reprehensible that those like herself and her husband, being devoid of credible positions, are able only to blame America and castigate its citizens. And that is exactly what Michelle Obama did -- with one sentence, she attacked every American, regardless of party affiliation when she uttered those profane words...Many Americans contribute to the Obamas' extravagant lifestyle. From those who clean their floors to those who sweep their sidewalks. Her comments reveal ingratitude and were an insult to millions of hardworking Americans and legal immigrants who appreciate the freedom and opportunity America offers. This country has made it possible for Michelle Obama to enjoy every privilege she and her family enjoy. Compared to the eloquent grace of Jackie Kennedy, Nancy Reagan, Barbara Bush and yes, even Rosalind Carter, she portrays herself as just another angry black harridan who spits in the face of the nation that made her rich, famous and prestigious."" Central to these ""critiques"" of Michelle Obama is the couched argument that a person who is a successful attorney and administrator living in a nice home has forfeited the right to talk about injustice and inequality. This argument is short-sighted and flawed. It implies that only poor people have the right to express concerns about poverty, only the sick and diseased have a right to complain about inadequate health care, only a victim of crime has the right to complain about high crime rates, and so forth. The day that the privileged in this country -- and that includes Sean Hannity, Bill O'Reilly, Rush Limbaugh, Laura Ingraham, Mychal Massie, and Michelle Obama -- are as disgusted with injustice and equality as is the poor black or brown or white single mother in Detroit, Michigan, is the day this country takes a living step toward realizing its potential as the ""city on the top of the hill."" Critiquing America is not the same as hating America.",0

Affirmative action? Multiculturalism? Liberalism? Few people, especially members of the dominant group, questioned whether white men had the right to be angry. After Senator Hillary Clinton lost her bid for the 2008 Democratic Presidential nomination, a great deal of media attention was given to Angry White Women, so angry they threatened to vote for the Republican candidate. Some of their anger was fueled by disappointment; that happens in every political campaign. Others were angry because Senator Clinton's campaign symbolized, for them, the struggles and promise of being women in this culture. Some were angry about the sexist slurs, both thinly-veiled and obvious and gross, that were directed against Senator Clinton. These angry white women had many reasons to be angry, but the point here is that their right to be angry was rarely questioned. However, when a strong-minded, high profile black woman expresses even a hint of displeasure at injustice in this culture she is treated like a non-patriotic, ungrateful Sapphire. The black woman who expresses anything short of a patriotism that borders on chauvinism is condemned.",0

The Sapphire portrayal has been around for as long as black women have dared to critique their lives and treatment. Sojourner Truth was seen and treated as a Sapphire, as were Ida Bell Wells-Barnett, Fannie Lou Hamer, Ella Josephine Baker, Shirley Chisholm, Anita Hill, Alice Walker, Rita Dove, and bell hooks. But the Sapphire label has not been restricted to abolitionists, anti-lynching crusaders, civil rights activists, politicians, and black feminists/womanists. Black women executives who voice disapproval at company policies run the risk of being seen as Sapphires, especially when the policies involve race and race relations. Young African American women who show displeasure at being treated as potential thieves when they shop are treated as Sapphires. The black woman who expresses bitterness or rage about her mistreatment in intimate relationships is often seen as a Sapphire; indeed, black women who express any dissatisfaction and displeasure, especially if they express the discontentment with passion, are seen and treated as Sapphires. The Sapphire name is slur, insult, and a label designed to silence dissent and critique.",0

He is basically known in relation to Michael Jackson, whether he dances better, whether he has surpassed him, whether he is the next Michael Jackson or the closest thing to Michael Jackson, not in his own right. At 25 Michael Jackson was already a global icon, famous even in countries where people don t even own tv sets but Chris Brown is hardly recognisable outside the USA. I would never have even heard of him had it not been for Michael Jackson. Michael Jackson could rap, disco, rock, sing ballads, soul, r and b, he was more versatile than Chris Brown ever will be. Michael Jackson sang They don t care about us and because the video was shot in poor neighbourhoods of Brazil attention was brought to poor districts neglected until then because of Michael Jackson, an impact Chris Brown does not have. Not Brown in particular not any contemporary artist. Michael Jackson introduced epic, iconic dance moves like robot, mime, pulvic thrust, slidewalk to name a few whereas Chris Brown dances like any freestyle dancer can. He has not contributed anything of his own to the art of dance or showmanship. Michael Jackson s moves were clean, elegant and graceful, praised by dance masters like Fred Astaire and Bob Fosse, while Chris Brown comes off as an acrobat very often. Michael Jackson was top in the 80 s and the 90 s and even in the 00 s, he topped the charts, sales, gave sold out concerts all over the world which Chris Brown cannot do. He is not the top of his genre, there are other rappers better than him, all of them combined don t surpass Michael Jackson s world records, sales, popularity and awards. Michael Jackson was not a rapper but when he did it he killed it. And his song had social meaning and has stood the test of time. Could Chris Brown do a video in Brazil and change people s lives like Michael did? Does Chris Brown have Michael Jackson s falsetto or chest voice? Chris Brown is not the closest thing to Michael Jackson and he certainly is not better than him. He is good but to even compare him to Michael Jackson is just as good as it gets for him. Michael Jackson was an artist who only happens once but there are many Chris Browns out there.",0

He hit people and was rude, and had mean things to say about everybody, and was ungrateful. But as time has gone on, he's grown up and matured, and is now a reasonably decent person.
3. Taylor Swift. I’m surprised I’m putting her on here too. She’s generally very generous and kind towards her fans and people in general, but she’s very defensive. When she was being blocked from performing her music at the AMAS, (VERY uncool,) She turned to her fans to drag Big Machines, which also isn’t cool.

Bane is known as “the man who broke the Bat” after he broke Batman’s spinal cord in the comics storyline. Warner Bros has a checkered history with the Catwoman; Michelle Pfeiffer was hailed for her performance as the feline in 1992’s Batman Returns.

1368064507382292480,Anne Hathaway is a baddie,"In August 1993, the American thriller Kalifornia [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalifornia ] came on theaters, featuring Brad Pitt as the psychopathic serial killer Early Grayce, the movie’s main antagonist, a man who not only kills people, but also sickly enjoys killing them (sometimes for no reason whatsoever); not to mention he takes great pleasure in abusing his girlfriend, violating his parole, and terrorizing the two main protagonists, without ever showing remorse nor being ashamed of himself.",0
1368064507382292480,Anne Hathaway is a baddie,"We have seen psychopathic villains before – and a lot of them do give such haunting performances that they truly scare the living s*** out of the audience, and thus constitute a great part of American cinema, such as Norman Bates [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Bates ] from Psycho [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psycho_(1960_film) ] (1960) or Alex DeLarge [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_(A_Clockwork_Orange) ] from A Clockwork Orange [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Clockwork_Orange_(film) ] (1971) –, but what sets Pitt’s performance apart from other psychopaths are two things: (1) is his age, particularly since the idea of having a villain so young (around 20–30 years old) and yet so mentally deranged is uncomforting for most people; and (2) is the fact that he passes on at first glance as a healthy, harmless guy – in other words, when we first get to meet him, Early appears to us just like any normal man with a Californian accent, so you wouldn’t think he has ideas of murder and of taking sheer pleasure in killing; in the end, that’s how all serial killers in real-life are, because they appear as normal guys, and they are human beings like you and me!",0
1368064507382292480,Anne Hathaway is a baddie,"Then again, a lot of serial killers tend to manipulate people, and trick their victims into thinking they’re normal, healthy human beings, before eventually accomplishing their unlawful deeds. And that’s precisely what happens when Early manipulates the two protagonists and makes them believe him to be someone of trust, with all the uneasy suspense that unfolds throughout the film…",0
1368064507382292480,Anne Hathaway is a baddie,"For these reasons, as with most movies featuring psychopaths, Kalifornia gained controversy from critics, whom accused it of being an exploitation film. However, in my opinion, that’s very far-fetched, because the movie is so convincing with its performances (especially that of Brad Pitt) and haunting atmosphere. If you haven’t watched this motion picture, go check it out, and see for yourself how Pitt’s acting is very poignant.",0
1368064507382292480,Anne Hathaway is a baddie,"As such, it is wrong to say that Brad Pitt has never played bad guys in his career, because he has played some, including his terrifying performance as Early Grayce in 1993. Not to mention that Pitt himself has been seeking out a role that was completely different from the wholesome “pretty boy” image he portrayed in his early movies of the 1990s.",0
1368064507382292480,Anne Hathaway is a baddie,"In terms of sheer power and impact, The Joker long-term. But Bane and The League of Shadows are without a doubt the greatest threat that Gotham ever faced. He successfully made a temporary robbery of Bruce Wayne's assets before eventually defeating him, built up an underground army, instigated a successful five-month occupation in which certain Gothamites plus many convicts of Blackgate joined his deceptive cause. Talia al Ghul worked on the inside ensuring that the resistance could not prosper, and the sheer power of the revolution of Gotham which is what brought the caped crusader to his knees (in a way unlike we've seen in a Batman film), makes him, Talia and The League the most powerful villains in the series.",0
1368064507382292480,Anne Hathaway is a baddie,"Since the other user here listed his ranking for the antagonists of the trilogy, here's mine:",0
1368064507382292480,Anne Hathaway is a baddie,"6. Jonathan Crane/Scarecrow: Much like The Joker, this fear doctor’s motives are kept in the dark. He’s not particularly deep like the five other major antagonists, but everything else about him is done to a sharp tune. Jonathan’s twisted love of science and using the fear gas to experiment with his victims, particularly Carmine Falcone, somewhat makes him like a twisted version of Sid from Toy Story. Cillian’s performance is subtly intimidating, snide and charming. Moments including him being gassed and interrogated by Batman, and him riding a horse in a cloud of fear gas are key in the first film. He’s the only villain in any Batman picture thus far to appear in three films- including his standout appearance as the hanging judge in The Dark Knight Rises; which plays an integral role in what makes that films’ social revolution aspect so compelling, and he makes himself memorable in those scenes despite a combined near two minutes of screentime.",0
1368064507382292480,Anne Hathaway is a baddie,"5. Miranda Tate/Talia al Ghul: Talia is the most divisive character in the series, but I stand by though that Marion Cotillard does a fantastic job with her (despite her four-second passing out death, which otherwise doesn’t hinder the films’ quality that much, big deal). Miranda starts out pure and charismatic, as she (apparently) wanted to bring Bruce out of his three-year seclusion (not eight as some have wrongfully assumed). Her misleading motives are sprinkled included picking up the weight of Bruce’s seclusion through a charity ball, and wanting to use the fusion reactor even after being rejected by Bruce. Hints to her true lineage come in waves, including a tender scene with her and Bruce as his life started to crumble again- her telling him about how her poor family felt rich through being by the fire. She contributes to The League of Shadows in ensuring that Gotham City would become a landscape for ruin for as long as it could for the bomb to annihilate them- including plugging herself into resistance movements so that Bane’s men could kill the special forces agents in horrific fashion, then the capture of Gordon and his partners. Her backstory with Bane and her father leaves an emotional impact, adding to the former’s humanity; also drawing influence from Charles Dickens’ A Tale of Two Cities- Bane is Monsieur Defarge to Talia's Madame Defarge. She has some terrific moments like her “The slow knife that cuts deepest” speech to Batman, and her cold look that she gives as she tells her henchman to “Shoot them all” as they kill Deputy Foely. Her inclusion doesn’t make Bane a lesser character but adds to their motives, an ally and his human side (he’s not a henchman, they’re collaborators).",0
1368064507382292480,Anne Hathaway is a baddie,"4. Harvey Dent/Two-Face: In the Company of Men, Erin Brockovich and Thank You for Smoking are pronounced roles in Mr. Eckhart’s filmography; and precursors to his one that’s most well-known to the public. He brings an effortless bravado to Harvey Dent, as seen in his courtroom introduction with Maroni and beating the defendant who fake-shoots him; moments like this imbue him with a sense of character for people to latch onto in TDK aside from the classic clown prince of crime. He also has an emotionally authentic side, making him not merely a wolf in sheep’s clothing; as shown with Rachel Dawes and his commitment to making Gotham a better place. His transformation into Two-Face is heartbreaking, and built up with his frustration towards the justice system and near-murder of the schizophrenic Schiff Thomas. Some believed that his arc was being radiated to make him to become the next big bad in the third installment, but that idea was overturned early on in the making of TDK. It made perfect sense as to not force sequel-bait, plus he wouldn’t have survived long with the scars and his tragedy is the hanging balance of the story. Harvey leaves more than a strong impression, and importance that shall not be forgotten; especially when the dystopian future of TDKR becomes a sad mirror of everything that “this fallen idol” strived for.",0
1368064507382292480,Anne Hathaway is a baddie,"3. Henri Ducard/Ra’s al Ghul: Much like Metal Gear Solids’ Big Boss; he in some ways serves as a foundation for the trilogy, as well as the shoulder devil for Bruce in the first half of Batman Begins. Liam has become notorious for his archetype/roller-coaster action pictures; but in 2005, he sizzled the screen with his small role in Kingdom of Heaven and this. Ra’s is about as radical as you could imagine for the leader of an ancient terrorist organization, but the way his dialogue is written and Liam’s performance makes you understand where he’s coming from. From a comics to film standpoint, the change of Ra’s al Ghul’s ethnicity makes enough sense here- If Ducard was Arabic, it would’ve been obvious that the Decoy Ra’s wasn’t real; and to not depict an Arabian man attacking a city a few years after 9/11. Ra’s, Bane and Talia are all Moroccan/Middle-Eastern; which still makes them foreigners/somewhat like the comics, plus Nolan valuing talent above all so this all makes sense.",0
1368064507382292480,Anne Hathaway is a baddie,"2. Bane: He very well competes with The Joker for my favorite antagonist in the trilogy, and it’s easy to see why certain people prefer him to the latter. Not taking comic book lore into account, he was the perfect choice for the final chapter rather than just settling for The Riddler or The Joker (again). Hardy made Bane his own in addition to the writing. He’s in a constant state of pain, with an animalistic glide of fighting and movement. A lot of horror about his past lies behind his impeccable facial expressions; especially in The Pit where Bane ensures that Bruce made it in there alive, and to know what lied in store for him- his body language in that scene is great. His introduction on the plane, battle with Batman and speech at Blackgate Prison are all incendiary. Hiding behind the guise of a helper of the people; he is surreal but also real, in how many in our own world can believe a madman under the right circumstances. The Nolan brothers could’ve simply written him as a tough guy (like his dreadful depiction in Batman and Robin) or an occasional roadblock for the dark knight; but they went beyond expectations and crafted an emotional and believable malefactor.",0
1368064507382292480,Anne Hathaway is a baddie,"1. The Joker: Not hard to guess, as Heath’s immortalized performance magnetized me from day one of seeing it. All of his tics, influences and horrifying motives and actions, Heath’s transformation have been discussed ad nauseum. All for good reason, “the Coca-Cola of fear” as described by critic Robbie Collin.",0
1368064507382292480,Anne Hathaway is a baddie,"I have reservations about him outside of the film, more so some of the egregious fan perspectives that came up over time. Some act as if he’s the only reason that made TDK successful, or that he should’ve returned in TDKR- all of these are hokum. Joker is an integral part of a well-oiled machine, what made TDK explode in the mainstream; as well as Bruce’s story arc. He appears out of thin air in Gotham, is stopped by Batman and last seen laughing before abruptly cutting to the climax with Harvey Dent. His absence in TDKR only strengthens that film; as it doesn’t rely on him to build the story; respecting Heath Ledger’s at the time recent passing while giving the character a Voldemort effect in how the people of Gotham refuse to acknowledge him- that’s great writing. All three chapters successfully revolve around Batman and Gotham, the fact that we got an award-winning and resonant character for many like this prince of darkness is just one part of the whole puzzle.",0

When Harry Met Sally was a great movie, but her pairing with Billy Crystal didn't work.

That over-the-top, turned-up-to-11 personality is what many find so grating about Hathaway. ""She's got this theater kid thing where she adopts the mood of every situation she's in—rude and bawdy on Chelsea Lately, poised and 'classy' at the Oscars, etc.— but wildly overcompensates every time,"" Richard Lawson explained to Hollywood.com. ""She always seems like she's performing, and her favorite act is this overstated humility and graciousness. I've known theater kids my whole life. I was a theater kid my whole life. She is the epitome of the bad kind of theater kid."" ""It's not really Anne Hathaway I 'hate,'"" writer Sarah Nicole Prickett said in a separate piece for The New York Times. ""It's all the lesser, real-life Anne Hathaways I have known — princessy, theater-schooled girls who have no game and no sex appeal and eat raisins for dessert.""",0

Fuck that bitch.,"The actress and the celebrity are two different people One of the most frustrating things about Hathaway is the alarming disparity between who she comes across as in interviews and how she appears on the big screen. In interviews, she can act like she's trying too hard; the Jimmy Fallon version of the aforementioned ""bad theater kid."" You know she's probably just having a fun time, but good Lord, you don't have to sell it so hard. And yet, for every annoying interview she may give, it's hard to lose sight of the fact that she's actually a legitimately good actress. Not only was she Oscar-worthy in 2012's Les Miserables, but one could argue that Hathaway was best in show the year she received her first nomination for 2008's Rachel Getting Married. She was also extremely underrated in Brokeback Mountain in 2005, held The Devil Wears Prada together in 2006, gave Michelle Pfeiffer a run for her money in The Dark Knight Rises in 2012, and .... ugh.

The one it found — Terry Pettijohn — only made the debate worse by arguing that people may hate Hathaway simply because of the shape of her face. ""When times are good, we prefer actresses with rounder faces,"" he said. ""They convey these ideas of fun and youth."" Pettijohn argued that Hathaway had a ""mature face"" that ""suggests she would be popular when times are more challenging."" Okay, we hear you, dear reader.

Franco initially received most of the criticism for what many felt was a low-energy and bizarre performance, but he eventually fired back, claiming Hathaway was at least partially to blame for why some thought he looked stoned on stage. ""I love her, but Anne Hathaway is so energetic, I think the Tasmanian Devil would look stoned standing next to Anne Hathaway,"" Franco told late night host David Letterman in March 2011. For her part, Hathaway took the experience in stride. ""In the grand scheme of things, I got to have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,"" she told Harper's Bazaar (via Pret-a-Reporter). ""I met great people, wore beautiful clothes. And I got to put on a show. I don't see a downside. Anyone who disliked my personality probably disliked my personality before the Oscars.""

""She's just so affected [and] actress-y that even when she wins an award she's out of breath,"" quipped radio host Howard Stern (via The Hollywood Reporter), ""and then she has the standard joke that sounds like it's [been] written [for her]. And it all seems so scripted and acted."" As Hathaway clutched her golden trophy, she quipped, ""It came true!"" referencing the iconic song she sang in the movie, ""I Dreamed a Dream."" That comment felt equal parts corny and way too rehearsed, to the point where it continues to be mocked all these years later. Suddenly, her dream became fresh fuel for her haters.",0

Take, for example, the time she called out the Broadcast Film Critics Association for spelling her name wrong while casually mentioning it was the second time they had given her an award. Or how about her nails-on-a-chalkboard, overly theatrical acceptance speech at the BAFTAs, during which she breathlessly thanked, among others, her hair and makeup artist, author Victor Hugo, and also herself for having laryngitis, otherwise she might burst into song. She also called out co-star Eddie Redmayne, who was reportedly backstage vomiting from food poisoning. ""Hey, Eddie,"" she joked, ""Get well soon. I'd come and hold your hair, but, you know..."" After the long-winded and warbling dissertation, one viewer tweeted (via the Daily Mail), ""Sigh.

Hathaway has not said much about the barrage of bullying, yet she did admit the jokes ""get to me,"" reported Us Weekly. ""But you have to remember in life that there's a positive to every negative and a negative to every positive.""

With references and examples of the greatest seducers like Casanova, Duke de Richelieu, Ghenji and the likes, Art of Seduction talks deep about personality traits and must have qualities to seduce not just women but people in general. I unlearned so many things after reading this book. For example: Most PUAs will tell you that you should go and approach right away, talk within 3 seconds and engage her. WRONG! Powerful seducers never approach, they only mark their presence for a while and exit the place, making the target imagine about the seducers power, reputation and fantasize the seducer in his absence. Another thing that I unlearned is the greatest seductive quality is not to talk and engage but to shut up, listen and patiently make seductive moves with body language.

Set up in the same break room where the first jam was shared. No cooking is required for this type of jam and simple instructions and recipes for most fruits are inside every box of pectin I have ever purchased. I usually use MCP, but if other brands don’t include recipes, they abound on the internet. Set up in the break room and spend how ever many hours/days it takes to produce the required jam. If possible, have each coworker you are making jam for help you in the process when his/her jam is being made. Turn the whole thing into a big team event.",0

In case he or she has the nerve to ask why (which, from what’s happened so far, seems entirely possible), you’ll want to have a response ready. Do NOT give excuses like “I’m too busy” or “I haven’t gotten around to it.” That implies that your boss has the right to order you to make jam, which is ridiculous. Respond with something like “I don’t want to” or “Because I’ve decided not to”.

Speculation (As only they know the true reason): They were going in two different directions career-wise.
 
While Garner was experiencing some modest levels of success, Affleck was again returning to the A-list after his brief sabbatical from that lofty position. The success of Argo and Gone Girl and the expected mega-success that Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice might be mean that Affleck will again be one of the most sought after leading men in Hollywood. That level of career disparity would be difficult in a marriage where the spouses working in separate fields; when they work in the same field it simply amplifies the inadequacies of the less successful spouse.

Many celebrities , buisnessmen keep visiting these hotels. Many times these celebrities want the furniture in their room arranged according to their need. This is where my Father comes into picture. My Father narrated this incident to me a few years ago. Vijay Mallya had arranged a buisness meet at the hotel. He wanted a round table arrangement. He gave the instructions to the house keeping manager who in turn gave the instructions to my Father. The manager told my father that the arrangement to be made was for ten people. Accordingly my Father arranged the biggest round table that was available in the hotel. Arrangements for ten chairs were also made as instructed by the house keeping manager. It should be noted that the biggest round table available in the hotel was for ten people. Vijay Mallya arrived with his fellow buisnessmen or friends. Amidst their meeting Vijay Mallya's son Siddharth entered the room.All the ten chairs on the table were already occupied. Vijay Mallya was amidst a heated argument with the fellow buisnessmen and was also using foul language. My father was present in the room to attend to the needs of Vijay Mallya and the businessmen seated with him. When Siddharth entered the room , Father arranged a chair besides the table. On seeing this Vijay Mallya became furious and said to my father “Mader***d itna chota table kyo laya “ (Motherfu**** why did you bring such a small table). Siddharth stood there silently, giving an enraged look at my father. We are from a lower middle class background.My Father could not complete his education due to lack of finances.He works very hard to pay for my college fees.Many times guests in the hotel treat him very badly and rudely.Also big hotels have no policy that condems abusing the support staff.

1345472994156560384,Jennifer Lopez is an idiot Also a bitch that will do anything to make a buck,"%3E ""It was Katrina Kaif. Some weeks back, I was at an upmarket hotel in Los Angeles with my extended family. I & some of my cousins were hanging out at the pool and the hotel's gym was right next to it. Through the glass wall, we saw Katrina Kaif working out inside. My 10-year-old cousin is a huge fan of hers for all the mass-y, masala movies he watches. He was very excited to go & meet her but we didn't want to disturb her or be rude. So we asked him to wait till she was done to approach her. After a couple of minutes, she was done with her workout. She was sitting, having juice & chatting to another white girl [May be she was her sister, I'm not sure]. We finally couldn't hold back our cousin any longer, so he grabbed his phone & ran to her. He told her he was a huge fan, told her she looked very pretty, & asked if he could get a selfie with her. Her reply? She looked at him with dead eyes said""Umm.. No""Then banged her juice glass on the table, turned back to the girl sitting next to her, mumbled something inaudible with a disgusted expression & they walked away.Who talks to a child like that? We would have understood if she would have declined firmly or simply ignored. We were prepared for that. We weren't prepared for her to treat a 10-year-old fan like vermin. The tone & expression with which she talked to my cousin was of utter disdain. I could literally see heartbreak on my cousin's face after she did that to him.Luckily Varun Dhawan & Parineeti Chopra were also there. [I think some Bollywood award function was being held in LA]. I don't know if they saw Katrina being rude to my cousin or they were just leaving the gym, but they came to the entrance of the gym where my cousin was standing all numb & heartbroken. Varun lifted my cousin in his arms & asked him if he recognized them. Both Parineeti & Varun talked very sweetly & nicely to him, like Parineeti told my cousin he looked very cool in his orange trunks, Varun told him that he has such a manly body that he should give Varun gymming tips & that he shouldn't become an actor or all actors will go jobless. Parineeti even ordered brownie & ice cream for my cousin, & we weren't billed for it so she was obviously so thoughtful about such a little thing that she must have paid for it herself. Thanks to them & no thanks to Katrina, my baby cousin was extremely cheerful. It is now such a happy memory for him that he has narrated it a hundred times to all his friends & family.""",0

 * Katrina Kaif - Needs the perfect frame, lighting, profile, and will ask for retakes & changes in blocking/lighting if she doesn’t look perfect. Ironically, she gets irritated if the director asks for a retake if she didn’t deliver well. Which happens a loooot. A sweetheart when the cameras are on, will bite your head off when they are off. Very classist, insecure, and cold.
 * Salman Khan - Always irritated and tired. Always. May he has some health problems? Who knows. Extremely unprofessional. Reporting to work 8–9 hours late is the norm. Refuses to rehearse, memorize lines, follow the script, or stick to what the technicians have prepared with days of hard work. If asked for a 3rd take, will announce a pack-up.
 * Sanjay Bhansali - He abuses, yells, throws things and tantrums, kicks people out. But isn’t a bad person, just a perfectionist. Post production, he is very sweet.
 * Sajid Khan - Know it all, disrespectful, hotheaded, and egoistic.
 * Deepika Padukone - She herself isn’t very rude. She is just a bland & dumb person. But she has the worst behaved entourage & she lets them act that way on her behalf. Her team goes overboard for her social media, appearances, songs, and advertisements; to the point that they have become a joke for people of the industry. Everything about her is scripted. Everyone is competitive, but they are obsessive.
 * Vijay - The most self involved Indian actor I’ve seen. Very egoistic, sexist, and disrespectful. Genuinely thinks that the world revolves around him, genuinely. Doesn’t give a damn about director’s vision, script, dialogue, screenplay, investments.
 * Mammootty - Very classist, sexist, egoistic, abusive, ungrateful, and ill-mannered.",0

I wasn't a fan of her music and knew about the movie, but she was just a singer who happened to be in it to me, so I didn't think anything of it. Her assistant seemed like someone who had worshipped her in high school that she ‘let be her assistant’. This girl did everything for her - it was a wonder she didn't break her back. The worst thing about J. Lo was her complete lack of respect for anyone. She wouldn't talk to anyone directly if you were standing in front of her face. She’d tell her assistant what she wanted from us so her assistant could then turn to us to repeat it like we didn't speak or understand English, let alone see or hear what she just said. She was too good to talk or look at other human beings that were beneath her. It was so deplorably rude and arrogant I had to bite my tongue from giving her the ‘what for’ to keep my job. Most of the employees resorted to stopping her assistant after ‘She wants…’ with an ‘I heard her!’ Sadly, it wasn't the only time I witnessed her crudity. There was more throughout the years; she is not a nice human being no matter how hard she might pretend to be. I’ll never forget the way she treated everyone around her. It makes me sad that she seems to have such devoted fans when she doesn't give a damn about anyone but herself. But hey, in America, people like that become President so what the hell do I know?",0

1300173590554464256,This mayer is a complete vile idiot.,"Yeah, but he’s an amazing guitar player. That’s what people say whenever John Mayer is held accountable for his pillow-soft songcraft, the dull sentimentality of his lyrics or that cuckoo-racist interview he gave to Playboy back in 2010. Knowing how to caress a Fender Stratocaster should not absolve a man of such party fouls, so I make this admission through clenched teeth: John Mayer is an amazing guitar player.",0
1300173590554464256,This mayer is a complete vile idiot.,"It’s hard to hear it on his records, where his over-compressed solos might zip past your ears, regardless of how sensitively they’ve been articulated. Strangely, you can hear it in stunning detail inside a cavernous arena, like Washington’s Verizon Center, where on Thursday evening Mayer repeatedly sent his most intimate gestures fluttering up toward the 400 level’s cheapest seats. He knows how to play the guitar, but more importantly, he knows how to play an arena.",0
1300173590554464256,This mayer is a complete vile idiot.,"And he filled this one up despite the fact that his seventh studio album, “The Search for Everything,” hasn’t been released in its entirety. Instead, Mayer has chosen to roll out the 12-track album in truncated four-song “waves,” with the final wave scheduled to crash on April 14. He’s also chosen a sweeping title for a songbook that, so far, chronicles his break-up with pop superstar Katy Perry over a series of sleek R&B toe-tappings.",0
1300173590554464256,This mayer is a complete vile idiot.,"Meantime, Mayer has kept busy on the interview circuit, still doing damage control seven years after casually dropping the n-word in an interview with Playboy during which he also referred to his libido as a “white supremacist” and compared his anatomy to David Duke. Since then, we’ve been left to wonder how, among other things, Mayer’s freaky brain makes such un-freaky music.",0
1300173590554464256,This mayer is a complete vile idiot.,"That doesn’t mean it isn’t mesmerizing from time to time. On Thursday, Mayer played two paralyzing solos – one during the louche strut of “Vultures,” another during a choppy acoustic rendition of “3x5.” Both felt dizzyingly fast, breathtakingly delicate and entirely of Mayer’s own invention. But just as he artfully undersold his virtuosity on the guitar, he often oversold the wistfulness in his voice, deploying his trademark sigh – the one that always makes him sound as if he’s using his dying breath to practice a new pickup line.",0
1300173590554464256,This mayer is a complete vile idiot.,"It sounded as icky as ever, but if you stretched your ears, you might have heard a more fundamental human desire, a man committed to propagating the species at any cost. And while it feels odd to ponder whether there might be a cosmic sexuality secretly coursing through Mayer’s music when there’s already so much cornball sexiness slathered on the surface, it’s important to remember that Mayer belongs to a proud lineage of schmaltz-shovelers – James Taylor, Sting – and that these soft-rock shovelers are often trying to bury something.",0
1300173590554464256,This mayer is a complete vile idiot.,"The most sexy-strange lyric to bubble up Thursday night came during “Love on the Weekend,” a new song cut from a bolt of Fleetwood Mac-grade organza in which Mayer describes his love buzz as a “serotonin overflow.” Crooning about neurochemistry felt like a step in the right direction, but if you heard Mayer recently tell Charlie Rose that his brain is like a “bingo cage,” or if you read that profile in the New York Times where Mayer described tabloid attention as “a human-growth hormone,” it’s easy to wish that his gab-gift would spill onto to his lyric sheet. What if, instead of atoning for all of those old interviews with new interviews, Mayer chose to wrestle with his strangeness in song? Shouldn’t his music be as weird as he is? Imagine a breezy, blue-eyed soul jam about battling the white supremacist beneath your zipper.",0
1300173590554464256,This mayer is a complete vile idiot.,"In the maestro’s mind, he’s already giving us as much as we can handle. Deep into Thursday’s set list, Mayer gave a quick speech that suggested he thinks too little of his audience and too much of himself: “There’s thousands and thousands of people here, and we’re going all over the musical map: acoustic, blues, R&B,” Mayer said to his flock. “And you guys have the breadth of heart and feeling to want to come and celebrate all of these songs. That’s phenomenal ... We are now in uncharted territory for a performer and crowd.”",0
1300173590554464256,This mayer is a complete vile idiot.,"In that moment, he sounded delusional. The territory Mayer had been covering all night was nothing if not well-charted, with more than a few of his bluesier solos sounding like they had been lifted out of ’80s cop movies. Familiarity was paramount. Decorum was upheld. Mayer was a pleaser above all.",0
1300173590554464256,This mayer is a complete vile idiot.,"Maybe that counts for something. Life is weird, which makes constructing a musical world devoid of weirdness a formidable task. Is it an honorable task? So many of our greatest musicians made their magic by communing with the unknown – but during his time onstage Thursday night, Mayer seemed to be extinguishing the unknown. And he made it feel completely effortless. I still can’t decide whether that’s an accomplishment or a pity.",0
1300173590554464256,This mayer is a complete vile idiot.,"On Instagram, he flaunts his IRL friendship with the New Yorker's Naomi Fry, a writer as well as a name with such cultural cachet that Brooklynites would add it to their Hinge profiles to signal their own very-online-ness. He is objectively attractive and only made hotter with the hair of a Boy Meets World star, the wardrobe of a men's fashion editor, and full sleeves. I'd like to submit to the court as evidence this self-styled GQ photoshoot using clothing from Mayer's own closet.",0
1300173590554464256,This mayer is a complete vile idiot.,"He always manages to stay relevant, his content toeing the line between annoying (his Instagram Live show ""Current Mood,"" the title itself a facetious reference to overused social media lingo, which he often co-hosts with Shawn Mendes) and so intentionally cringe-y I'm confused to the point of being appreciative (a TikTok in which he rates his favorite aquarium sizes). He's yet another self-aware boy who sings about waiting for the world to change, but instead of changing it himself he makes jokes to keep us entertained as we sail toward inevitable old age and death. He is the string quartet on the Titanic. And he leans into it.",0
1300173590554464256,This mayer is a complete vile idiot.,"John dated Jessica Simpson, Jennifer Aniston, Minka Kelly, Taylor Swift, and Katy Perry, and was treated in the press with a courtesy that was never extended to his exes. While Swift was subjected to post-breakup coverlines like ""Why She Can't Find Love,"" Mayer's dating track record was chalked up to a bachelor with unquenchable thirst — a 2012 RollingStone cover read ""The Dirty Mind and Lonely Heart of John Mayer."" These editorial choices do not belong to Mayer, of course, but he is not without fault in the narrative. In the same RollingStone interview, he likened breaking up with Aniston to burning the American flag. ""I basically murdered an ideal,"" he says, speaking as though Jennifer were not a person but a prized object. He continued on a strange dialogue in which he says he felt ""cosmically"" responsible for creating a link between Aniston and another woman, Dimple$, both of whom he'd slept with, as though he were the central figure in either woman's story.",0
1300173590554464256,This mayer is a complete vile idiot.,"It's these actions I'm talking about when I say that I don't trust myself with loving John Mayer. I don't trust myself to remember his faults, to hold him accountable. Through the course of his career, Mayer has been criticized for being a douchebag toward women, for being the exact archetype of the glorified bad boy that we, in a post-#MeToo society, have begun to break down. When I share his funny Instagrams with friends, the messages are always prefaced with, ""Ugh, I hate how much I love this."" Because if John can get away with referring to his junk as a ""white supremacist,"" with publicly discussing the very private details of his sex lives with multiple famous women without their consent (and I'm not talking about his lyrics, but interviews he's given), then what am I condoning? What does this crush say about me?",0
1300173590554464256,This mayer is a complete vile idiot.,"You could label this conundrum the burden carried by any person who dates cisgender heterosexual men: It's not my job to understand or forgive John's actions, or to make space for his career to continue to flourish despite his flaws; it's my job to work toward a society that is safer for marginalized people. It just so happens that we live in a world where a man whose career exemplifies white-male privilege is given a million chances, and his scorned exes are not. Simpson wrote about how uncomfortable his ""obsession"" (his word) with her body was in her 2020 memoir; Swift, who was 19 to Mayer's 32 when they dated in 2009, wrote of their relationship in a song, ""​​Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?/ The girl in the dress cried the whole way home.""",0
1300173590554464256,This mayer is a complete vile idiot.,"If you've ever met a Taylor Swift fan, they will tell you that Mayer is on a tier with the shittiest men in Hollywood history. But he's also one of many who've slipped between the fingers of cancel culture. Here's a successful white man who has admitted that he's kind of a dick to the women he dates. At the same time, he is fed to me via the algorithm as though none of his disgusting behavior ever played out in public. And you know what? I eat it up. I have a fat crush on John Fucking Mayer, but I also love and hear and see the women he has harmed.",0
