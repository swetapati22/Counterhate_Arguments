While the ‘center’ is arguably further ‘right’ than it used to be, I wouldn’t call Pelosi a ‘Republican Classic’, not by a long shot.

1450943621046362112,Nancy Pelosi is so ugly her mama had to tie a pork chop around her neck to get the dog to play with her!!! BTW! # FJB,"Nancy Pelosi is a corporate Democrat aka NeoLiberal. She has supported some progressive legislation when she would look bad if she hadn’t done so but she mostly avoids legislation that will be harmful to rich lobbyists, banks, insurance companies, certain corporations, and Big Pharma. If you do a little research into the bills she has blocked or not supported in the past, you will notice that they all would’ve had a negative impact on people who are huge donors of hers. She’s an angel compared to Mitch McConnell who never compromises at all and doesn’t care what people think of him. He’s totally corrupt. But Nancy is basically a corrupt politician who is very good at playing the game and who is willing to compromise and do the right thing occasionally. A recent example is when Ilhan Omar called out the undue influence a Pro-Israel lobby group had over lawmakers, Nancy sponsored a resolution naming Ilhan as “Anti-Semitic”. When she got blowback from a majority of Democratic lawmakers, she backed off.",0

BTW! # FJB,"To answer your question one would have to assume that Nancy Pelosi was a Republican at some point. NP is the antithesis of a Classic Republican. To some degree, I can understand the confusion as in 1987 when she first went to Congress the parties were much different, not polarized and actually cared about the constituents. Dark money had not yet entered into the races and there was some restraint on the part of lobbyist and their masters. The Russians did not yet own the presidency as Ronald Reagan was still president and they were our nemesis. The EU was our friend and we worked together. But overall, in my opinion, NP is a classic Democrat and not a liberal despite her association with San Francisco, she is a pragmatic Democratic with a severe distaste for Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell.",0

Even things they SHOULD know she has no power or control over, they automatically blame her. When Trump rejected that last bill with the stimulus in it, people complained there was too much money being allocated to other countries, to the Kennedy Center, etc. Trump rejected it. Nancy was to blame. I was in disbelief at the things I read about her because anyone who knows even the most basic of politics would know that the only way that bill ever even made it to Trump in the first place to be able to reject it was it had to have enough agreement from both sides, which is made up of BOTH Democrats AND Republicans. But it’s all Pelosi’s fault? Not one word about the conservatives that helped get it there. It was all Pelosi.

He then went on to say he planned to make sure anything Obama(the sitting President at that time) tried to accomplish while in office he would make it his business to BLOCK it! If you think Nancy ripping up a piece of paper that didn’t even kill a tree was disrespectful, but you’re completely ok with the Senate Majority leader openly admitting his plans to deliberately oppose any and everything a President wants to do even before he does it is ok, then you’re the worst kind of hypocrite to be and you should really be embarrassed, though clearly you’re not.",0

1450942595215998978,Piers Morgan is a twat,"To get a glimpse as to why so many people loathe him, just watch Piers Morgan on TV and you’ll bear witness to one of the slimiest, most obsequious interviewers around, giving the likes of Jimmy Fallon and Alex Zane a run for their sycophantic, shoe-shining money. Planting his lips firmly on the anus of every celeb he encounters like a butt-loving lamprey, Morgan usually sits there flattering and slobbering all over his subject (Pamela …ahem… Anderson). It’s rather perplexing how this boot-licking twat has made such strides on British television when he possesses no talent at either presenting or interviewing, I assume dick-licking gets you everywhere from being Murdoch’s flunky to Trump’s bitch.",0
1450942595215998978,Piers Morgan is a twat,"In what was billed as an “exclusive”, Piers recently interviewed President Donald Trump, I say “interviewed”, as what took place was the pair sitting so close that you expected them to embrace each other and make out at any moment. If you take a quick look at Morgan’s Twitter profile pic, you’d be forgiven in thinking he was Trump’s rent boy but only if ol’ Don was blind or had a thing for middle-aged, saggy-necked pretentious gits. With Piers venturing so far up Donald’s arsehole during this interview, he could probably see the fast food lodged in his teeth. Safe to say, this was in no way a hard-hitting or probing interview and this seems to be a trait of his.",0
1450942595215998978,Piers Morgan is a twat,"Piers Morgan also recently sat down with stand-up bigot Jim Davidson, and surprise, surprise, his questioning of his well-documented racism and homophobia was condensed to approximately five minutes (if that) of an hour long interview bookended by the likes of Peter Stringfellow, Iain Duncan Smith, Michael Gove, Nigel Farage, Dappy, and sell-out Matt Blaize defending him (what a great set of people to be acquainted with).",0
1450942595215998978,Piers Morgan is a twat,"Basically, if you’re a has-been celeb, Piers Morgan will be half-way up your sigmoid colon before you’ve answered his first non-question, if however you’re some regular chap he disagrees with, he’ll interrupt you like a parrot with Tourette’s. I can say with confidence therefore that Piers Morgan is no Jeremy Paxman or Jon Snow, he isn’t even a John Bishop, his questions hardly scrutinise and therefore the answers hardly enlighten or entertain. And because the likes of Morgan and Fallon have become the norm when it comes to interviewing, this is the reason celebrities have a hissy-fit when someone like Krishnan Guru-Murthy asks question not pre-approved. Quentin Tarantino and Robert Downey Jr. would probably love the Piers Morgan treatment, he’d never dream of deviating from the publicist-approved script. But I digress.",0
1450942595215998978,Piers Morgan is a twat,"On the topic of moronic Yanks, Piers Morgan pratted around in America during the noughties like an ambassador of arses. It makes you wonder why only the worst Brits are exported to our former colony; from Simon Cowell, James Corden, John Oliver, to Piers Morgan, hopefully sending these vanilla white fuckwits states-side is some kind of revenge for American Independence, if not, the United States really has a skewed idea of what a British celebrity is.",0
1450942595215998978,Piers Morgan is a twat,"Of course, Piers is no longer living or working in the US of A, and yet if you keep up with his continuing pontification on US-based topics, you’ll know that he is still firmly anti-gun. Morgan’s stance on gun control is understandable I guess, because if guns were declared legal in the UK tonight, he would resemble Swiss cheese before tomorrow’s Good Morning Britain started airing. When a twat like Jeremy Clarkson punches you and comes off as a veritable national hero, you know how much of a cunt you are.",0

This trash tabloid working, hoax photo peddling, phone hacking scandal involved, share meddling, Celebrity Apprentice winning cunt is more irritating to the eyes and ears than CS gas. The fact that he’s sucked Simon Cowell‘s cock and licked Donald Trump’s backside, it seems he has a taste for peremptory pricks. Maybe that’s why he’s such an arrogant gobshite himself.

1450942595215998978,Piers Morgan is a twat,"Foremost among those demons is his thin-skinned tendency to embark on vendettas. His efforts to destroy Ian Hislop because he didn't like his nickname in Private Eye, his feuds with Jeremy Clarkson, AA Gill, Hugh Grant, Madonna… To use the well-known phrase that has become emblematic of his latest catastrophe, he can dish it out but he can't take it. Everything is personal with him.",0
1450942595215998978,Piers Morgan is a twat,"Not far behind his fragile ego is his disregard for common decency. His sense that consequences were for other people has led him to do some genuinely lousy things - from the breach of a struggling woman's privacy that cost him the editorship of The News of the World to the knowing slander of serving British soldiers that cost him the editorship of The Daily Mirror, and the culture he created at that paper which led to a slew of phone hacking claims.",0

That Piers, what a card, eh?",0
1450942595215998978,Piers Morgan is a twat,"This time, though, it was all too clear that he simply lost all self-control - that his personal venom would always outweigh his professionalism, and that he just wouldn't care.

1450942595215998978,Piers Morgan is a twat,"Behaviour like that costs a network viewers. It arouses the concern of advertisers' media buyers. It makes the network look bad. And if you have systematically steamrollered your colleagues on camera for years, you can expect no support from those around you. You make your professional position untenable. You make your employer lose faith in you. That high-stakes gamble becomes a thousand-to-one shot, not a business risk worth taking.",0

1450920155559731202,Avril Lavigne is the baddest white bitch to ever live and I will fight anyone on that pedestal,"On the 15th anniversary of the pop star’s hit single “Complicated,” a conspiracy theory claiming that she died in 2003 and has been replaced by a lookalike has resurfaced. If you aren’t familiar with the theory, this blogpost dating back to 2011 from a Brazilian site should bring you up to speed. The basic idea is that Lavigne, who was at the peak of her career at the time, committed suicide after her grandfather’s death in 2003. Rather than coming to terms with what had happened, Lavigne’s record company used Melissa Vandella – Lavigne’s doppleganger who was supposedly hired to pose as Lavigne for paparazzi – in her place to profit off of her celebrity.",0

At some point, the real Lavigne is said to have died, so the record company replaced her with Melissa full-time. “Proof” has included Lavigne’s red carpet shots (Lavigne wears trousers; Melissa prefers dresses and skirts) and supposed differences between the facial features of pre-2003 Lavigne and the current incarnation. Theorists also believe Melissa has left clues in songs, such as Slipped Away, in which she sings: “The day you slipped away was the day I found it won’t be the same”. There was even a publicity shot in which Lavigne had “Melissa” written on her hand. Spooky.",0

The urban legend took root in 1969, following the release of the Beatles’ Abbey Road. Fans hunted for clues – they were convinced John Lennon was saying “I buried Paul” in Strawberry Fields Forever, for example (Lennon said he was actually saying “cranberry sauce”). Unlike some more recent conspiracy theories, the person at the centre actually rebutted the claim. In an interview with Life magazine in November 1969, McCartney said: “Perhaps the rumour started because I haven’t been much in the press lately.”",0

Seems reasonable. The theory, which dates back to 2011, claims Swift is an Illuminati clone of Zeena LaVey, the daughter of the founder of the Church of Satan. Essentially, the two look similar.

It is also claimed that the Illuminati uses clones to brainwash society. Sometimes, all it takes to set the conspiracy wheels in motion is two different pictures of the same person, and the Beyoncé cloning theory gained a flurry of attention last year when a Facebook post that compared images of the singer from 2010 and 2016 went viral.

Her album of the same name was released five months later and continues in the same vein as the lead single. Head Above Water is relentlessly personal, there is no doubt about that. Unfortunately, there isn’t too much musical identity anywhere else in the record, and the rebellious spirit of Lavigne’s earlier music is absent.",0
1450920155559731202,Avril Lavigne is the baddest white bitch to ever live and I will fight anyone on that pedestal,"While the message of Head Above Water is abundantly clear — Lavigne has survived the turmoils of disease and toxic relationships — the actual music fails to have a consistent theme throughout. It doesn’t help that most of the tracks just aren’t that great to begin with. The production sounds too dry, and Lavigne’s vocals too bland. An album filled to the brim with rock-driven ballads, the more pop-oriented tracks tend to come out of left-field, and not in a good way. In particular, the fourth track, “Tell Me It’s Over,” is a doo-wop disaster of a song that would make Billie Holiday roll in her grave.",0
1450920155559731202,Avril Lavigne is the baddest white bitch to ever live and I will fight anyone on that pedestal,"The slower ballads that make up most of the album don’t bring much to the forefront. The title track “Head Above Water” is the most powerful of the bunch, which would be fine if the other songs were nearly as good. Most of them sound like tunes that a Christian rock band would put out. On the sixth track “It Was In Me,” Lavigne sings about turning to her faith on top of a very uninspired orchestral accompaniment: “All I needed was a little faith in my life.” Indeed, there are quite a lot of references to God throughout this record, which might put off someone who never really listened to Lavigne’s music wanting to be more religious.",0

Not only does it sound like it belongs in the 2000s, but the idea of claiming that blonde, white women are oppressed is quite laughable, especially in a time where women of color are claiming more agency than ever before.",0
1450920155559731202,Avril Lavigne is the baddest white bitch to ever live and I will fight anyone on that pedestal,"I don’t want to dismiss the pains that Lavigne has gone through over the past years; no one is doubting that Lyme disease is terrible and sometimes fatal. However, since the record is overloaded with slow ballads and emotional lyrics about sadness and toxicity, I found it extremely difficult to continue listening by around the 30-minute mark. My favorite track of the album, the groovy sounding “Bigger Wow,” is upbeat and fun, but comes way too late in the record for it to make much of an impact. Head Above Water is a strikingly intimate record for Lavigne, but regrettably, not her best.",0

I really just wanted to sing and make it about that, so it was nice to explore with different sounds like “Crush” and “Tell Me It’s Over”; they’re a little bit more throwback and jazzy. I kind of felt like I was going back to my roots — I got my start in church and musical theater before I started writing my own music.

I was like, “Ooh that’s a good concept and title.” It started as a misogynist intimidated by my independence. I just thought that was really unfair. If you’re a leader or you’re a strong woman or someone who has an opinion or is driven, you shouldn’t be made to feel bad about that.

It’s not necessarily about my illness but about other stuff in my life. I love that song because it has an empowering message of standing up for yourself, doing something about a situation you’re in, taking charge, and removing yourself. I think a lot of people can relate to that whether that’s a toxic relationship they’re in, or they’re not happy with their job.",0

His writing is beyond Saintly, & overflowing with profound wisdom. He’s even younger than Harry Styles but carries a mind typically reserved for the greatest philosophers & Leaders of all time. It’s something you really have to listen to yourself, and a true test of will not listening to his songs 100’s of times. His newest release may be the greatest song ever recorded, and exclusively revealed to his Instagram followers. Thats one thing that really makes him special.

1450920155559731202,Avril Lavigne is the baddest white bitch to ever live and I will fight anyone on that pedestal,"1. BTS: Usually my go-to with the deep meanings and endless genres. Ballad, rap, hip-hop, trap, pop, EDM, and even Latin and rock.
2. Sam Smith, Ed Sheeran, Lana Del Rey: They both have pretty sad types of music (which is what I listen to a lot) and, Lana del rey is definitely underrated.
3. Rihanna, Khalid, Shawn Mendez , Ariana Grande: They all have popular music but most of the music I listen from Shawn Mendez are his non-recent ones and, all of the music I listen to from Ariana Grande are her older ones because I don’t like her new music.
4. Cardi B and other rap/hip hop: Listen to a bit ya know when I need it.
5. Lil bit of Maroon 5, John Legend, Taylor Swift: I listen to them casually and, I used to love Taylor Swift before her “the old Taylor is gone” thing but, I kinda am getting into her again after Me with Brendon Urie.

1450920155559731202,Avril Lavigne is the baddest white bitch to ever live and I will fight anyone on that pedestal,"Alternative rock: Weezer: which I started to listen to a ton during my middle school years and still listen to now as a senior in high school. Will always love them. Ozma: are very similar to Weezer in that they sing about love n’ stuff, and their first album is such a joy. The Strokes: but listen to pretty much their hits, which are pretty nice. Cage the Elephant: listen to the hits. Pavement: some of their hits. The Cure: my friend put me on them and I wasn’t disappointed, love listening to them. The Smiths: well, my friend also got me into them, great band. The Smoking Popes: love their hits!",0
1450920155559731202,Avril Lavigne is the baddest white bitch to ever live and I will fight anyone on that pedestal,"Other types of rock: Dealership: a very lofi/garage rock kind of band from California, which aren’t very well known. I started listening to them during my sophomore year of high school and love all three of their albums. What’s interesting about them is that literally none of them knew how to play their instruments, but they prevailed and made a pretty solid debut album. You can find them on Spotify. Voxtrot: listen to just their hits, but their damn good hits. Someone Still Loves You Boris Yeltsin: My Lord, this band has had a BIG impact on my life. I think I picked them up during my junior year of high school and I just enjoy them. Their first album is a must listen, please listen. My Bloody Valentine: During my junior year philosophy class, my philosophy teacher told me about a band he would listen to with his buddies while at college, it was called My Bloody Valentine. I listened to them and they weren’t bad, love When You Sleep. Neutral Milk Hotel: Found them during my freshman or sophomore year of high school. Definitely got more into them during my sophomore year of school because of the same teacher who taught my junior year Philosophy class, but taught theology. On Avery Island and In The Aeroplane Over The Sea are gems for sure. Also started guitar playing guitar with their songs so thanks NMH. The Olivia Tremor Control: they’ve got a weird ass name for sure, but they’ve got amazing stuff! Their Dusk At Cubist Castle Album is certainly a great one and must listen, well some of them. Overall a great band. Peach Kelli Pop: they’ve got some cute hits. Potty Mouth: ah, these are amazing ladies. They’ve got some powerful punk songs and are inspiring to me, they’re from Massachusetts, I think. Steve Lacey: love his hits. Vampire Weekend: love like two songs",0
1450920155559731202,Avril Lavigne is the baddest white bitch to ever live and I will fight anyone on that pedestal,"K-Indie/Rock: Hyukoh: wow! These guys are where it’s at! They are truly amazing and love basically all their stuff. Look and Listen: a strong rock band that isn’t too well known I don’t think. Love their first album and they’re just amazing, for real!",0
1450920155559731202,Avril Lavigne is the baddest white bitch to ever live and I will fight anyone on that pedestal,"J-Rock: This genre is a big one for me! Found most of these bands in my sophomore year of high school. Shishamo: they are one of the best I’ve ever set my ears to listen to. I fell in love the first time I heard them, they’re stupendous! Truly! I just love all the stuff they put out and I just love them, give them a listen. POLKADOT STINGRAY: a great, pretty sure they’re math rock, band. Found them and loved them, really amazing stuff. Tricot: awesome math rock band and they’re something different which I needed. Gesu No Kiwami Otome: wow! Just wow! Love the lead singers voice, and they’re something for sure. The rest are just bands who just do openings for anime to be honest. Sakanaction: different from other bands, I like that.",0
1450920155559731202,Avril Lavigne is the baddest white bitch to ever live and I will fight anyone on that pedestal,"Rap: ok, rap, I don’t listen to rap anymore to be honest, but used to listen the hell out of it. Kendrick Lamar: legendary, really. Found him during middle school and he’s just one of the greatest. JCole: wet dreamz was a gem and other hits. Basically early 2010 rap was good.",0

Then there are the various genres of modern popular music, pop rock,blues, country etc. Practically,get on a streaming service,search and listen. The service will offer you tracks based on your listening,so widening your experience. YouTube is brilliant for finding new music. Pick a track listen, then read comments.

Why do I continue to eat ice-cream when I have a lactose intolerance? We may never know. Here’s another mystery I’ve been grappling with for a few years: what did we, the human race, do to deserve the excellence of Beyoncé?",0
1450891437470519298,I hate Beyoncé so much. She is so overrated.,"Like everybody else on the planet, I received the gift back when she was lead singer of Destiny’s Child. (In 1998, I co-choreographed a routine to their hit No, No, No, and performed it at school.) I remember no special affection for DC-era Bey: she was a great frontwoman, and managed to carry off some truly terrible outfits with aplomb, but somewhere along the way, my feelings morphed into something more passionate.",0
1450891437470519298,I hate Beyoncé so much. She is so overrated.,"Here’s why: raw talent and an unstinting work ethic. It’s that simple. Nobody works harder than Bey. The muscular voice, the obvious care when it comes to choosing her collaborators, the fashion and the thighs: they’re all just frosting. The cake is a ton of sheer hard work, which I was lucky enough to witness when I (finally) saw her in concert earlier this month. When you add in the maturation of her politics (feminism! police brutality! girls’ education!) and her style, Beyoncé is in a league beyond any other popular musician. “Empower” is one of those words much bandied about by marketers eager for women’s cash, but it’s truly how Beyoncé makes me feel. When I watch and listen to her, I feel a number of things: a surge of self-love, wonder, strength and a bubbling, excited joy at being a woman – a black woman, at that. That’s magic.",0

Most would agree that her voice is naturally beautiful; she doesn't need the fancy technology to enhance her singing. Not to mention that all her songs provide listeners with a good beat and lyrics that you can sing along with (unfortunately I do her no justice). This is one of the reasons to love Beyonce.,1
1450891437470519298,I hate Beyoncé so much. She is so overrated.,"Everyone knows that Beyonce is one curvy lady, she is highly known for it. She is not one of the girls who hides who she really is, in fact she owns it. Beyonce has never changed how her body is or been ashamed of it.

Now, I haven’t actually achieved dancing like her, but it’s the effort that matters. She is known to be one of the great dancers, and watching any of her videos or performances always brings a good show. Based on the amount of videos inspired by Beyonce I’d say most agree that she is an outstanding dancer.",1
1450891437470519298,I hate Beyoncé so much. She is so overrated.,"Beyonce has admitted that her ears a big, now normally if a celebrity has a flaw, they will go out and get it changed with surgery. Beyonce plays it up, she wears extravagant earrings to dress up the ears that she finds to be big. I think that is a wonderful way to play up any flaws you have, don’t be ashamed because as previously stated we are all beautiful just as we are!",1
1450891437470519298,I hate Beyoncé so much. She is so overrated.,"With the recent addition of baby girl Blue Ivy, Beyonce got the three from two that she sang about. She and hubby Jay-Z married in 2008 and they just seem to get happier and happier. The sweet little family is so cute, and I know they make me smile; they are an inspiration for families everywhere! There are so many reasons to love Beyonce; I’ve just talked about a few. Are there any more that you can think of? Why do you love about Beyonce?",1

Her music over the years has evolved from highlights of her love life to now shifting the spotlight on political, social and cultural issues that root back to her community and ethnicity. While we know that Beyoncé has championed the art of audio-visually painting a powerful story through her music, but there’s more to her contribution than changing the tides in the world of pop, country, and R&B. On her 40th Birthday, let’s look at her body of work that cemented her as the multi-hyphenate that she is.",1

In 2013, when she became the second black female artist to perform at the Super Bowl halftime she brought the house down will all-female band members and backup dancers.

The list of ventures she co-pilots and leads include self-produced music records, a music streaming service, a hefty and long-running contract with Pepsi and L’Oreal as a model and spokesperson, fashion label Ivy Park and a film production house called Parkwood Entertainment.

From her Destiny’s Child day Queen-B rocked that backless halter, cowboy metallic boots, low-waist jeans and frosted lips like no other, serving just the right amount of glamour. Thigh-high bodysuits with laced-up sky-high heels became her signature attire on stage and also the ultimate pop star uniform. Who can forget her 2011 VMAs pregnancy announcement in a sparkly suit? To top it all, she manages to weave in black history while walking the red carpet in iconic ensembles.

Her vocal was not pre-recorded (not that I could tell), she danced her effin ass off, the numbers were well polished and rehearsed, and her charisma was incredible! Her command is superior! You first have to understand what it takes to pull off a performance like that…. YEARS, my friend! Years of dedication to your craft! Learning how to connect with your audience. Perfecting every inch, every breath, every syllable and every step of your performance. And mostly, to have an ability to interact with your audience as she does, it ain’t easy. I can tell you that from experience. She excites her audience… So, unless you have been able to do such a thing, or have been a spectator at such an event, then I guess you are right, you would not know what is so “special about it.” You would not be able to appreciate the artists’ beauty and perfection.",0

1450891437470519298,I hate Beyoncé so much. She is so overrated.,"First of all I am gonna say that I am not a Beyonce fan. “If I Was A Boy” is the kind of sexist dribble that makes all men out to be misogynistic adulterers, and Beyonce probably did the opposite of what she intended by creating a whole generation of the ‘nice guys’ that have to point out “not all men are pigs”, every five seconds. Her other hits are nowhere near that awful but even then I can’t quite get into them because when a guy treats her badly in one of her songs and she rightfully shows her power to him, it feels very much like a fantasy, not something that would actually happen. My favourite songwriters are ones that show vulnerability. You can see a lot of realism in the words Joni Mitchell wrote or the words Leonard Cohen wrote, or for a more modern example, the words that Regina Spektor wrote. Not every songwriter needs the most accurate understanding of relationships ever but I find Beyonce to be more about girl power (which isn’t necessarily a bad thing, young women may get a lot of confidence from that which is important for their development) than the actual truth of what happens when a couple seperate.",0
1450891437470519298,I hate Beyoncé so much. She is so overrated.,"Now that this is out of the way I have to blatantly disagree with that statement that her voice is very average. It’s incredible. Beyonce can hit four octaves and while four is a small number in general, anyone who knows music theory knows that this is a huge range. Bruce Dickinson of metal band Iron Maiden and many opera singers can be credited with this, but how many people in the pop world can say they have four octaves or more? Well there’s Mariah Carey at five octaves. She’s unbelievable. Yet i’m not sure I can think of anyone else. Now this is of course on a purely technical level and I don’t think that’s what makes a great singer, I mean i’m in the minority that Tom Waits has one of the most unbelievable voices i’ve ever heard because I have a different definition to the masses of what constitutes as a great singer. That being that a singer doesn’t need to sound polished and easy to bare on first listening nor does a singer have to have a particularly high range. A singer just needs to be in control of the notes they’re singing and have a lot of passion in the way they deliver them. And Beyonce is passionate.",0
1450891437470519298,I hate Beyoncé so much. She is so overrated.,"As much as I don’t enjoy her power fantasies, I do believe they would not work if it wasn’t for how much power her voice has. No one would listen to one of these songs if they were sung by a squeaky voiced mouse. You need someone with command to be able to perform this kind of anthem. She does it well. As for never having a huge hit songs, i’d suggest looking at the numbers. “All the Single Ladies” is super popular. It’s everywhere. Does that make it good, well that’s subjective. Yet based on your criteria, it has to be.",0
1450891437470519298,I hate Beyoncé so much. She is so overrated.,Beyonce has personality and she has presence and she has tapped into something that other artists have not.

She also was in Destiny’s Child and stole the show because she knew what people wanted to see and never settled for less. Beyoncé is a wonderful singer with a powerful voice but she is a performer so she knows how to get a crowd. Most singers now days aren’t really performers but she’s a good dancer and singer.

She’s all about money and getting money, and you hear this from very early on in her careeer. And she’s about using her own sexuality and sex appeal to get money. Her rabid individualism displays itself very early on in her career; if not in her work in Destiny’s Child, then in her song Me, Myself and I [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Me,_Myself_and_I_(Beyonc%C3%A9_song) ] (in my opinion one of her best songs musically and an impressive work) which came out on her solo album.

Both of these songs emphasize the need for self-care and the fact that, in many important moments of our life, we are alone and can only care about ourselves. But for Black Thought, this one song lives within a context of a career of music that focuses intensely on community, telling not just his story but those of constant others. Even in that song itself, I think his love for others and for the broader community and society is evident; it’s like the fabric in which the song is written.",0

This song, besides focusing just on women, also plays into the sort of materialistic individualism that I referenced before. I didn’t have a problem with this one song when it came out. It was only when I started to see the broader pattern here…that it seemed like this was all Beyonce had to say: empower women through advancing in the materialistic capitalistic system. There is little to no emphasis on community; the only solidarity in her later music seems to be between “strong women”, who are depicted as women who are aggressive, flaunt their sex appeal, and succeed in the capitalistic economy.",0

1450891437470519298,I hate Beyoncé so much. She is so overrated.,"I don’t mean this to sound like i’m dissing her, but in my opinion if you compare her skill to skill against other singers from the 1990’s and 2000’s, she just doesn’t really measure up. Vocal Chops? sorry but Whitney, Mariah, Christina and Celine have her beat there. Dance talents? sorry but Janet, Madonna, Britney and Rihanna have her beat there. The only area where Beyonce really is competitive is that she has had a lot of marketing and promotion geared towards making people think she’s a genuine talent.",0

1450891437470519298,I hate Beyoncé so much. She is so overrated.,"Musically, I find Beyonce’s solo work slightly less compelling than her work with Destiny’s child. One of the things I liked so much about that group was the interplay of the voices, the busy, complex textures with different people singing in a kind of counterpoint. So part of it is that I love that R&B girl group sound and I think Beyonce really shined more in that environment than as a solo artist.",1
1450891437470519298,I hate Beyoncé so much. She is so overrated.,"But I do think Beyonce does some really great and innovative things on her solo albums. She collaborates with a ton of artists and her songs have a more diverse range of sounds than she ever had with Destiny’s Child. The production quality on her songs is good and a lot of them are catchy but musically interesting enough to listen through over and over again. If it were just a question of how the music sounds, Beyonce’s work would fill up my playlists.",1
1450891437470519298,I hate Beyoncé so much. She is so overrated.,"I perceive Beyonce politically because she actively got political.

1450891437470519298,I hate Beyoncé so much. She is so overrated.,"Beyoncé is the ideal entertainer for our time. Vocally, she isn't one of the best ever. In other aspects of music, she also isn't the best ever. However, she's highly developed in each aspect, and it is the combination of all these things in one person that makes her so great. She also has longevity and -contrary to what people think - originality (even if she took from Tina Turner and Michael Jackson). She is going to be a legend for sure. In fact, she is already legendary. However, I feel that her fans are fanatical to suggest that she is on par with or superior to Michael Jackson in any aspect of music.",1

I mean she is beautiful and a good singer, and an awesome performer but a fan of hers, nope. I believe the way her fans called the beehive idolizes her is a huge turn off for me. She is not in the league of Whitney Houston and certainly not Micheal Jackson, so I don't see the idolism. I believe she has a great PR team that keeps her relevant and thus her fan base. I like her business antics but her music, I don't. It's a personal opinion.",1

She is inspiring the next generation of artist which I think is cool. Also, I think it’s cool that she keeps to herself and doesn’t get caught up in all the useless drama. I hope that’s one thing the next generation takes from her. she’s no Michael jackson (as people are comparing her to. No one is ever going to accomplish what he did.) but she is a living legend.",1

1450891437470519298,I hate Beyoncé so much. She is so overrated.,"I think she’s a talented singer who managed to capitalize on the girl group trend of the late 1990s, became the lead member of one of the most popular groups in that trend, then embarked on a wildly successful solo career and developed a cult of personality for herself that’s managed to keep her in the spotlight years after she stopped having hit singles. It’s this cult of personality, I would say, that’s cemented her status as one of the most enduring figures in 21st-century popular culture.",1
1450891437470519298,I hate Beyoncé so much. She is so overrated.,"This is simple. People like to be noticed. They like to be loved. Therefore, they realize that Beyonce is popular. They begin to act more like her, wear things like them, and possible become them. This brings more attention to Beyonce, making people realize more and more, how popular she is. This gives her more influence over people. Repeat over and over, and you begin to see why she is treated as a God. This is usually only for people with lower brain activity. A.K.A. Sheeple.",0

After she filed for divorce from Pitt in September 2016, sources alleged to Page Six that Jolie was on a mission to ruin Pitt's otherwise perfect Hollywood golden boy reputation, even assembling a team to smear his name. The site reports that Jolie enlisted Lady Arminka Helic, a member of the U.K. House of Lords and a former adviser to Britain's ex-Foreign Secretary William Hague, and Chloe Dalton, a former aide to British ex-Foreign Secretary William Hague. One source said, ""They have been calling all the networks and news outlets, placing stories that he was cheating, drunk, on drugs, out of control and abusive, which Brad denies ... They were with Angelina in LA as she filed for divorce, and advised her how to handle things ... which was basically a scorched-earth approach. It's no coincidence that since they went back to London, things have calmed down."" Insiders also told People that Jolie's moves in her divorce from Pitt were deliberate in an effort to make the proceedings public. In December 2016, Jolie filed court documents publicizing her and Pitt's custodial agreement, a move that infuriated the actor and those close to him. ""There is absolutely nothing different about the situation today as opposed to yesterday as opposed to when this agreement was put into place,"" a source said. ""This is pure spin and manipulation, as absolutely nothing has changed ... There is zero legal purpose for filing this. Zero."" Legal experts also pointed out that the filing could have potentially compromised the family's safety, as it provided information about her, Pitt's, and the children's schedules. A source told E! News, ""Angelina regrets the way she handled certain things and wants to be at peace with Brad ... His kids are everything to him and their happiness and success is what's most important. He would never ever put them through what they went through if he could have prevented it,"" the source said. Another insider explained, ""He blames Angie for how public everything became ...

(She did the same when she and Pitt first got together in Africa, Rolling Stone alleged.) The New York Times explained it in 2008: ""Ms. Jolie expertly walks a line between known entity and complete mystery, cultivates relationships with friendly reporters and even sets up her own photo shoots for the paparazzi ... Most skillfully, she dictates terms to celebrity magazines involving their coverage of her and her family, editors say, creating an awkward situation for publications that try to abide by strict journalistic standards."" Those terms reportedly included no longer using the name ""Brangelina,"" ""blanket positive coverage"" of the starlet, and a large focus on her and then-lover Pitt's charity work. Some of those terms were exposed when The Smoking Gun published a contract from Jolie's lawyers for reporters to sign while doing press for A Mighty Heart (2007) in 2007, leading more than one outlet to reportedly boycott the film's promotional rounds. The contract dictated that ""the interview may only be used to promote the Picture. ... The interview will not be used in a manner that is disparaging, demeaning or derogatory to Ms. Jolie."" The contract was later rescinded by her lawyer, but the damage was done. Page Six reported in February 2017 that after Jolie's split from Pitt, she was desperate for an image makeover to the point that she actually attempted to hire a publicist for the first time in years after handling press on her own, though at least initially there were no takers. However, public relations expert Raoul Felder explained, ""Hiring a PR person now is like going for a checkup at the doctor after you've already had the heart attack ... The real skill would have been avoiding the PR problem to begin with ... Angelina has for years used her kids, and used the UN, for her own benefit.

And Brangelina was, aptly, the ultimate celebrity brand. Both are Oscar winners, among the highest paid stars in the film business (Pitt is said to be worth $300m, Jolie $150m), mainstream draws and indie icons, and of course utterly gorgeous (Pitt was twice voted the sexiest man alive by People magazine, while Jolie was named sexiest woman alive by Esquire magazine in 2004). But Brangelina also became a byword for celebrity altrusim and consciousness-raising. Pitt accompanied Jolie on many of her UNHCR trips, they opened schools in war-torn countries, and three of their six children were adopted from countries brutalised by conflict and poverty – 20-year-old Maddox is Cambodian, 17-year-old Pax is Vietnamese and 16-year-old Zahara is Ethiopian. They even managed to manipulate the media to their own ends. Faced with the inevitability of being papped when their daughter Shiloh was born in 2006, Jolie and Pitt auctioned off the photoshoot to People magazine in the US and Hello! in Britain for $7.6m. Two years later, when twins Knox and Vivienne arrived, they sold the shoot to the same magazines for an estimated $14m, making them the most expensive celebrity photos in history. On both occasions, the proceeds went to the Jolie-Pitt Foundation to fund humanitarian projects. As a couple, they seemed too good (or at least too successful) to be true.",0

Pitt admitted he had an alcohol problem (he attended Alcoholics Anonymous after their separation) and that he had yelled at one of his children, but has always denied being physically abusive to them.

She suggests that had she been a boy, other choices would have been offered. “Nobody tells you you can be a director or a lawyer.

Angelina couldn’t take his emotional rejection and was determined to punish him by taking his kids away so she filed for divorce and filed bogus child abuse claims.

I too think Angelina Jolie is overrated as an actress. She has won an Oscar for Girl interrupted, which i don’t agree. Her performance was just good, not Oscar worthy in my opinion. Most of her movies are commercially successful ( Gone in 60 seconds, Tomb Rider, Salt, Mr and Mrs Smith, the tourist ) but objectively she has not much range. She is not very versatile. She has a star power no doubt but i don’t think it comes so much from her acting talent. However, her performance, her best so far in my opinion, in Gia i must say was fantastic. She killed it. Then, again she was playing a character very similar to herself. I have not been impressed by her other movies.

In the beginning and into the 2000′s she had relationships with her costars/headliners. In Foxfire she even switched teams and began a relationship with that costar as well(Jenny Shimizu) I think the exception might have been her next film, Girl Interrupted. Winona Ryder had the lead in that one. Then there was Pushing Tin in which she married her costar and famously wore his blood around her neck(Billy Bob Thorton) She then met Brad Pitt in Mr. And Mrs Smith, stole Jennifer Anniston’s husband in this one broke up a family and married him. She continued to acquire children and husbands and even had three natural children with him.(Twins and one other) I don’t doubt she has talent. But giving her habit of acquiring husbands and children, her life has overshadowed her work. You never think of her work first when her name is mentioned.

To me she’s in the league of Julia Roberts, Halle Berry and Emma Stone who all are mediocre at best in both talent and beauty yet keep getting shoved down our throats as ‘greats’.

His impressive auto collection consists of more than 100 vehicles, including a McLaren F1 that he bought for $800,000 that is now worth $12 million. Otherwise, the host of CNBC's ""Jay Leno's Garage"" is pretty frugal. His financial philosophy has always been ""really conservative,"" he tells CNBC Make It, partly because he had Depression-era parents: ""They just frightened me to death, saying, 'You gotta save every penny!' And I'm glad they did."" If cars are his big splurge, the main thing Leno refuses to spend on are clothes. ""I'm not a big shopping guy. I'm just not interested in clothes"" outside of the essentials, says the self-made millionaire. ""To me, it seems like a complete waste of money. I just want to have enough clothes to cover legally what parts I have to cover.""",0

I own my buildings. I own my cars. That way, if it ends tomorrow, I know what I've got,"" Leno told CNBC Make It in 2016.

The problem is that people who are out of control do crazy, unpredictable things, like drink bleach and stab themselves in a suicide attempt. I think at first Howard was just terrified that someone who was so close to him could do something like then. After that, you have to ask yourself the question, “How did I not know that this guy was still doing heroin?” It makes you question your own judgment and I think after Howard had done some soul-searching, he decided that the best thing for him and for Artie is for them to end all contact. Not with malice, but with the understanding that Artie needs to get his life together and Howard can no longer enable him or be a part of his life. The fact that Artie has gone to rehab again and again (have you seen his nose lately?) means that he is still struggling with his demons. He’s no longer the fun-loving former longshoreman who has great stories, he’s a self-destructive drug addict who is endangering himself and anyone around him. While as a fan I would love to hear Artie back on the show one time, I understand if it’s too painful.

In the years that followed, Gibson made several comments that went public, made him seem anti-Semitic and racist. They made him persona non grata at major studios and agencies, the same ones that work with others who’ve committed felonies and done things far more serious than Gibson, who essentially used his tongue as a lethal weapon. As a journalist who vilified Gibson in The New York Times and Entertainment Weekly until my coverage allowed me to get to know him, I want to make the case here that it is time for those Hollywood agencies and studios to end their quiet blacklisting of Mel Gibson. Once Hollywood’s biggest movie star whose film Braveheart won five Oscars and whose collective box office totals $3.6 billion, Gibson hasn’t been directly employed by a studio since Passion Of The Christ was released in 2004.",0

During his breakup with Grigorieva, he’d gone through a terrible emotional breakdown and struggled to get healthy, gain joint custody of his infant daughter and deal with the fallout from the publication of those awful tapes. He was in a very bad place and we talked for some time about how difficult it was for him to deal with the pain he’d inflicted on his family — his ex-wife Robyn and his seven children, his infant daughter. He got so upset talking about that period in his life that he ended our call abruptly.

Whether it’s Gibson, Tom Cruise or Alec Baldwin, the descent from media darling to pariah can happen quickly after they do something dumb. I was part of that pack of journalists paid to pounce, so I know. I consider myself intelligent, someone who makes up her own mind, but just like readers do, I have accepted some reports at face value. The press said that based on Gibson’s statements, he was a homophobe, a misogynist, a bully, an ant-Semite, so he must be. What he was, I discovered, was an alcoholic whose first outburst was captured after he fell off the wagon.

Just as he refused to condemn his father in that TV interview with Diane Sawyer, Gibson refused to discuss his dad with me. Similar to what he told Sawyer, Gibson told me that he believed that 6 million Jews were murdered in the Holocaust. “Do I believe that there were concentration camps where defenseless and innocent Jews died cruelly under the Nazi regime? Of course I do; absolutely,” he told Sawyer. “It was an atrocity of monumental proportion.” In our conversations, I took that a step further. Why, I asked him “did you say those things about the Jews starting all the wars? Where did those unkind things come from?” Gibson thought for a moment, then answered that he’d been terribly hurt by the very personal criticism of him from the Jewish community over The Passion Of The Christ. He said that while he’d been criticized for films before, this was personal and cruel. He said that when he drinks, he can be a mean drunk and “Stuff comes out in a distorted manner…” His own faith led him to make his version of Christ’s story, and he found himself being attacked for making a film that might get Jews killed, and that he was insensitive that his depiction of Jews as Christ’s killer could inflame religious tensions. He was called names by numerous Jewish leaders and a few people literally spat on him. “The criticism was still eating at me,” he told me. “This was a different kind of hammering. A very personal attack.”",0

He worked in Hollywood for 30 years without a single report he was anti-Semitic. Before that drunken evening in July 2006, he worked all the time with producers, directors, actors and crew who happened to be Jewish, without incident.

It takes a certain kind of person to make movies with the intensity of Braveheart, The Passion Of The Christ, and Apocalypto. As I’ve seen with other temperamental stars, there is a wildness in his blue eyes, an electricity that is part of what has made him a big movie star and a great director. One has only to interview the man to see that there’s something a little different in how he sees the world. He’s intense and rash, and he struggles with alcoholism. Despite the Australian bravado, and the crude humor, he is actually quite sensitive to criticism, even if he doesn’t publicly challenge or deflect it.",0

Gibson followed up by meeting with a wide variety of them. He gave me their names when I asked, but Gibson asked me not to publish them because he didn’t want them dragged into public controversy or worse, think he was using them. The meetings were not some photo op to him, he told me, but rather his desire to understand Judaism and personally apologize for the unkind things he said. He has learned much about the Jewish religion, befriending a number of Rabbis and attending his share of Shabbat dinners, Passover Seders and Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur dinners. I believe that effort, along with our conversations, helped him understand why Jewish people reacted as they did to The Passion Of The Christ and why there was Jewish support for the Second Vatican Council. Gibson has quietly donated millions to charitable Jewish causes, in keeping with one of the highest forms of Tzedakah in the Jewish faith, giving when the recipient doesn’t know your identity.",0

He came out of that experience determined to film the Jewish version of Braveheart. He set at Warner Bros a film about Judah Maccabee, who with his father and four brothers led the Jewish revolt against the Greek-Syrian armies that had conquered Judea in the second century B.C. That seminal story is celebrated by Jews all over the world through Hanukkah, the Festival of Lights. Gibson planned to direct, but the effort was undermined by the decision to hire Joe Eszterhas to write it.

Start with Robert Downey Jr, who at one point was broke and an insurance risk on films. Gibson put up the insurance bond himself to secure Downey to star in The Singing Detective, which Gibson’s Icon produced. It was a performance that ignited the actor’s resurgence. I know that he also helped Britney Spears when she hit bottom, and that he tried to save Whitney Houston from the drug abuse that ultimately killed her. Not everybody is that generous: when Gibson himself needed a break that came when Warner Bros hired him for a showy role in The Hangover Part II, he was abruptly dropped when cast complained to director Todd Phillips.

I base this on interviews with her lawyer and the deputy district attorney who handled the case.

In the one case of domestic abuse, the victim could potentially be a defendant in the other case of extortion. If we’d filed an extortion charge against Ms. Grigorieva and tried to call her as a witness in the domestic abuse case, no defense attorney on the planet would allow her to answer questions.”",0

He was depressed and lonely, his career in shambles as he apologized to anyone who’d listen. Alone in a new house, he tried to stay off the sauce. It was then that he met Grigorieva, a Russian pianist who’d dated composer David Foster after being married to actor Timothy Dalton.",0

Shortly after, according to published emails, Grigorieva began arguing with Gibson about whether he would provide for her if they split. This intensified after the birth of their daughter in October 2009, when she began taping the recordings that she allegedly leaked to the press despite a judge’s order. Those recordings revealed a man in personal turmoil. While they contain racist and misogynistic statements, there is also evidence that the comments she made to provoke those statements were conveniently edited out. No matter. You can’t make any of what he said OK, and Gibson paid a price much higher than whatever monies Grigorieva walked away with. Whatever good will Gibson had in Hollywood evaporated.",0

He is sober seven years, hitting the gym for a role in an independent film, and thinking positively about the future. It has been 11 years since he was paid by a major studio to star in a film, and he hasn’t directed a studio film since Braveheart won five Oscars including Best Picture and Best Director. He wasn’t the bad person I thought he was back when I first wrote about him, and I’m telling you, he is now not the person you think he is.

 * Keanu Reeves turned down Speed 2 because he had just wrapped up another action heavy film just a month before he was offered that part (and also didn’t like the script) and was tired of the physical demands of those films. It’s worth mentioning that the film sucked, as well as that Sandra Bullock had originally declined the part herself, but eventually caved in when Fox promised to distribute a film she had produced that same year (and pay her a butt load of money).
 * Rachel Weisz did not return to make the Mummy 3 because she had signed on to produce another film at that time (or at least that was her excuse).
 * Emily Blunt turned down the role of Black Widow also due to scheduling issues.
 * Julia Roberts turned down Shakespeare in Love because she wanted to work with Daniel Day-Lewis so, when he dropped out, so did she. Gwyneth Paltrow took the part instead (and the Oscar).
 * Sandra Bullock turned down Million Dollar Baby again, due to conflicts in schedule, Hilary Swank took the part (and the Oscar).
 * Julia Roberts turned down the Blind Side, due to conflicts in schedule. Sandra Bullock took the part (and the Oscar).
 * Kate Winslet was eventually denied the role of Bridget Jones because she was considered too pretty.
 * Sean Connery denied the role of Gandalf in Lord of the Rings because he didn’t understand the film.
 * Will Smith denied the role of Django (in Django), because he wanted to be the only lead character, and didn’t like the fact that the film actually had 2 lead actors.
 * Robert Downey Jr and Anjelina Jolie were originally cast for Gravity. Jolie dropped out due to schedule, RDJ because both he and the director agreed that the technical aspects of the project didn’t allow him the freedom he needed to create the part.
 * George Clooney was supposed to be the main character in the film Our Brand is Crisis, a film he had in development for years (and was the producer of). Sandra Bullock read the script, asked him if he was too attached to the role because she liked it, and he offered her the part.
 * And my personal favourite: Pamela Anderson was considered by FOX for the role of Dana Scully in the X-Files. The only reason they didn’t cast her was because the creator of the series, Chris Carter, insisted on casting Gillian Anderson instead.

 * Neither Keanu Reeves, nor Sandra Bullock read the script for Speed 2. They both declined when asked if they were interested in coming back for the sequel. Bullock eventually caved after negotiations, and was begging to be handed a script even after shooting began.

What she’d learned from her fiancé’s death, as she put it in her book, was that “there is a very real struggle going on in our world today—the age-old struggle between good and evil.” For Grace, the criminal justice system became a realm of damsels and dragons, a prime-time morality play that she starred in and cast.",0

Today we want to understand colleges’ bureaucratic oversights in adjudicating sexual assault or the ingrained biases that guide routine traffic stops. It’s telling that Grace’s slew of episodes devoted to Brock Turner, the Stanford swimmer convicted of sexual assault, failed to make her into a dominant voice on the topic.

It’s worth noting that alignment with the perspective of victims is now the default media position in a way that it once wasn’t and that Grace may even be partly to thank for this development. But even when she was right—and it is hard to deny there was some satisfaction to be found in her medieval wrath—she was so enamored of human drama that she was too often blind to the context around it, so focused on giving us villains that she ignored the structures that aided and protected them. This may also be why her coverage of the Black Lives Matter movement felt so forced—the unrelenting news of police shootings has made it impossible to pretend that each new case is somehow phantasmagoric or strange. Our new mode is to see the kinds of stories Grace covers not as one-off scandals but as evidence of racism, sexism, or some other deep societal flaw.

In order for her to loom so large for so long, she needed the cannibals and the toddler-killers to stoke our deepest fears. Now all around us we see signs of how entrenched our cultural demons are and how banal their disguises can be.

Leather gloves, in order to fit snugly, stretch out a bit when they are worn, and stay stretched out for a period of time, but shrink back slightly when they’re not worn. So, they were in a state where they had to stretch a little to achieve a proper fit.
2. OJ was also wearing latex gloves which added a slight amount of thickness and significant friction to OJ’s hands.
3. Most importantly, it was left completely up to OJ himself to demonstrate whether the gloves fit or not. If he was able to get the gloves on, he might spend the rest of his life in prison. He needed them to not fit, so the attempt to get the gloves to fit on his hands was laughably weak. If he had worked them a bit, he might have gotten them on - that’s normal for snug-fitting leather gloves, and OJ knew that because, well, they were his gloves.
Edit: As many responders have pointed out, OJ was also advised by his defense team to stop taking his arthritis medication for a while before attempting to fit the gloves. This caused his hands to swell, making it even more difficult to fit them on his already large hands.",0

If they had wanted to cut the movie time down, they could have just had Kevin call the police from the parents’ bedroom when Marv and Harry first came to the door. This, however, would have completely broken the script. These two not-so-bright robbers were terrorizing an eight-year-old, for crying out loud.

Nancy Grace is a villain.","%3E Despite being released in 1990, there's no real attempt to set it in the same year. Christmas Day was a Tuesday in 1990. Within the reality of Home Alone, Christmas Day is a Friday. The events shown on film denote a five day week.The film opens on the evening of Monday the 21st of December and the McCallisters leave for Paris on the morning of the 22nd. It would take around 9 hours (average flight time) to get there and the time difference would mean that they would land early morning, French time, on Wednesday the 23rd. A journey back by plane would take another 9 hours but the next plane to from Paris to Chicargo is not until Friday morning. As previously discussed, Friday is Christmas Day and Kate refuses to wait for this. Kate begins her journey back home on the evening of the 23rd by getting a plane to Dallas and then onto Scranton where she arrives on Thursday the 24th. She is forced to travel by road with Gus and his band. The car journey from Scranton to Chicago would take approximately 12 hours so we can assume that she leaves in the evening with a few stops on the way. She arrives on Friday the 25th, shortly before the rest of the family. They caught the Friday morning plane from Paris and gained back the journey time in time difference. Kevin is therefore left home alone for almost exactly three days (Tuesday morning to Friday morning). Each of his evenings alone end with a visit from Harry and Marv (the first where they are disturbed by the sudden light, the second where Kevin fools them with the silhouette party, the third when they actually enter the house).",0

For someone like me, it really sets the tone for an audibly historical ambience (as much as possible… the pronunciations aren’t completely accurate to the era, but this film at least tried). However, for the general public, they may be lost, even with subtitles. For example, there is one scene where Pilate is questioning Jesus in Aramaic. Jesus suddenly responds in fluent Latin and shocks the Romans in the room. This scene was entirely lost on the general public unless they knew some Latin or Hebrew to “get the gist” of one language or the other.

1450768683937288192,Mel Gibson is absolute scum. 🤬 https://t.co/pADH982v0e,"I used to work in the film industry, feeding the cast and crew. I absolutely LOVED my job and did it on & off for about 20 years. I was working on a film with a woman I was really looking forward to meeting, Marlo Thomas as I used to watch her on “That Girl” back in the 60’s. Her co-star was Joe Penny (from Jake and the Fatman) and I had worked with him before on another movie. When I delivered his breakfast to the make-up trailer, she was at the far end & just staring daggers at me. Right from the get go, she wanted me fired & made it her mission to make my life miserable. When she couldn’t get me fired, she came up with the most creative ways to make me look bad. She sent her minions to ask me to write out EVERYTHING I did during the day & have it sent to her. Then, in front of the crew, she blurted “what IS this (referring to the craft table), do you know how hard these people work? I received many sympathetic looks from the crew, most of whom I’d worked with for years. She continued to shame & embarrass me but my PM (production manager) came to my rescue & told her that if I go, HE goes. I had been specifically asked for because of my experience & personality and managed to get through the entire show. She mentioned to the crew that she would be coming back for another project and asked for them to be on that show with her again. Not one of them said yes. She was such a hateful shrew. The daughter of Danny Thomas, who grew up in the industry but because of some personal vendetta, she acted like a spoiled kid. I was soooo disappointed but there ya go. Just because you see them on tv or the movies, you don’t have any idea who they really are.",0

A whiner (his show was cancelled because he was too conservative, according to him. Waaaahhh!), a drunk, and not even a funny comedian. Seems like a full service jerk.
2. Angelina Jolie - All over the map and not in a “good way”. Puts her personal life on display and then complains when she’s questioned about the inconsistencies. Went on a “child buying tour” around the world , yet seemingly treats them like accessories. Made a number of unfounded accusations about her ex-husband Brad Pitt and has not retracted even though the majority were proven to be false or overstatements.
3. Mariah Carey - Tremendously insecure. Acts like a diva which would be good if this was 1995, but it’s actually 25 years later. Apparently goes out of her way to make people who work for her and around her feel uncomfortable at all times.
4. Gwyneth Paltrow - Completely detached from reality beyond her own wants and needs. Is making a great deal of money selling junk and nick-knacks to the foolish and unwary. Is possibly the phoniest person in Hollywood which itself is quite an accomplishment.
5. Jenny McCarthy - Presses an anti-vaxxer agenda, all the while knowing that she’s influencing people and causing harm. Unwilling to modify or end her cause célèbre even after medical professionals have come out against it. Basically a person without a moral center.",0

Years ago, in  the middle of the Whitewater investigation, one heard the first murmurs: white skin notwithstanding, this is our first black President. Blacker than any actual black person who could ever be elected in our children's lifetime. After all, Clinton displays almost every trope of blackness: single-parent household, born poor, working-class, saxophone-playing,  McDonald’s-and-junk-food-loving boy from Arkansas. And when virtually all the African-American Clinton appointees began, one by one, to disappear, when the President’s body, his privacy, his unpoliced sexuality became the focus of the persecution, when he was metaphorically seized and body-searched, who could gainsay these black men who knew whereof they spoke? The message was clear: “No matter how smart you are, how hard you work, how much coin you earn for us, we will put you in your place or put you out of the place you have somehow, albeit with our permission, achieved. You will be fired from your job, sent away in disgrace, and—who knows?—maybe sentenced and jailed to boot.

In the case of black men who rise out of poverty or troubled households, it's the system of employers or the business community or law enforcement, who all always treated black men as somehow being more worthy of suspicion or scrutiny; in the case of Clinton it's the system of Congress and (especially) the press, who both relentlessly dogged him for his perceived personal failings in a way no prior president had been dogged.",0

That changed with his sharp-elbowed campaigning on behalf of his wife in her run against Obama in 2008, and revelations about the sometimes sloppy conduct of his postpresidential personal and financial life (including flights on Epstein’s private plane) dimmed his luster further.

Commanders intended the attack to be swift and precise, but the operation quickly fell apart. Hostile Somalis shot down two hovering U.S. combat helicopters. U.S. ground forces were assaulted as they tried to flee and were ambushed as they attempted to reach the crews of the downed helicopters. With exits to the city blocked, and an increasing number of killed and wounded, American soldiers were forced to hunker down and await reinforcements. In the end, eighteen U.S. troops died, and eighty-four were wounded. America was left with horrific images of soldiers' bodies being dragged through the streets and angry questions of how and why such a disaster occurred. The U.S. presence in Somalia dated from December 1992. Then-President George H.W. Bush envisioned that “Operation Restore Hope” would be limited to humanitarian assistance and would ideally conclude sometime in early 1993, time enough to have put Somalia on the road to recovery from famine and civil war. Nevertheless, the operation became more complex than anyone imagined. Leaders at the United Nations became convinced that Aidid, who had resisted political reform both prior to and following the recent introduction of UN personnel, was largely responsible for the harassment and killing of peacekeeping forces and humanitarian workers. In the end, they sought to remove him from power. When President Bill Clinton came into office, his administrative team sought to scale back the venture in Somalia. Calls from Congress and Pentagon officials, urging the President not to expand “Operation Restore Hope,” contributed further to a more circumscribed approach. Defense Secretary Les Aspin rejected requests from local commanders for more troops and vehicles, confident that U.S. forces would not attempt operations exceeding existing capabilities. The Battle of Mogadishu, however, led President Clinton not just to minimize but to end the U.S. presence in Somalia. Clinton's actions generated criticism from those who believed he should have carried through and captured Aidid- that in not doing so, he had simultaneously dishonored the soldiers' deaths and harmed American military credibility. The affair contributed to the perception that the President lacked foreign affairs expertise. Many became skeptical of the idea that the United States could or should serve as a post-Cold War, peacekeeping nation-builder, particularly under the direction of the United Nations. Regardless, the Battle of Mogadishu- both its causes and its effects -highlighted the complexities of the post-Cold War American military mission.",0

On December 8, 1993, President Bill Clinton signed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which eliminated nearly every trade barrier between the United States, Canada, and Mexico, creating the world's largest free trade zone. The House of Representatives approved NAFTA on November 17, 1993, by a vote of 234 to 200. Remarkably the agreement's supporters included 132 Republicans and only 102 Democrats. That unusual combination reflected the challenges President Clinton faced in convincing Congress that the controversial piece of legislation would truly benefit all Americans. President George H.W. Bush was NAFTA's original sponsor, signing the deal on December 17, 1992. The trade agreement ended tariffs between Mexico, Canada, and the United States, and set a 15-year timetable for the elimination of most other impediments to international investment and commerce between the three nations. Like many Republicans, President Bush believed that open economic borders between nations would benefit all concerned. Ideally, as production rose to meet the new demand for American exports, jobs, wages, and the economy as a whole would improve. However, securing Congressional approval fell to the newly elected President Bill Clinton. It was not an easy task. Labor leaders were skeptical of NAFTA's promises. They believed that American corporations would flee the United States in order to profit from much lower Mexican labor costs and the new absence of tariffs. Presidential candidate Ross Perot spoke to those concerns when he famously predicted a giant “sucking sound” as U.S. jobs were lost to America's southern neighbor. The fears of labor—traditionally one of the strongest components of the Democratic coalition—helped explain why passage of NAFTA proved so difficult. President Clinton and key members of his administration worked tirelessly to assuage the fears of key House Democrats. The President inserted limits on agricultural imports to minimize the negative effects of competition on produce. He also created a North American Development Bank in order to assist development along the Mexican border and show sympathy with the concerns of Hispanic Representatives. Clinton was willing to risk alienating American labor to some degree because he was convinced that long-term prosperity depended on free trade between nations, and because he felt that his administration needed an important, visible early win to generate momentum and credibility. NAFTA amounted to an administration victory, but many still regarded it as a net loss for American labor and the environment, which they claimed suffered in the absence of adequate Mexican regulations.",0

The agreement establishes a unitary Bosnian state and allows refugees to return home. On November 21, 1995, the Dayton Peace Accords were initialed in Dayton, Ohio; they were formally signed in Paris, France, on December 14, 1995. The agreement was reached between the warring nations of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, and Serbia. It sought to end one of the worst European conflicts since World War II, a four-year struggle of hardship and atrocities that had claimed the lives of more than 250,000 people, and made refugees of more than two million. President Bill Clinton's Assistant Secretary of State Richard Holbrooke led the negotiations and worked with the leaders of Bosnia, Croatia, and Serbia to reach acceptable terms. The details of the accords were cast in seductively simple and hopeful terms. Bosnia would remain a single state and would be granted international recognition. While its capital of Sarajevo avoided partitioning, the nation now consisted of two divided segments: the Bosnian Croat Federation, inhabiting 51 percent of the territory, and the Bosnian Serb Republic, occupying the remaining 49 percent. The accords also sought to create within Bosnia the institutions of a modern liberal democracy, including a central government composed of a constitutional court, a national parliament, and a presidency, with the latter two being filled by internationally supervised free elections. Military forces were to be substantially restrained, with protections for human rights coming from an independent body and an internationally-trained civilian police. President Clinton sent a peacekeeping force of 20,000 American troops (part of a larger NATO deployment) into the region to enforce a cease-fire that was to be followed by free elections. While few would say that the Dayton Accords were not an important step toward peace in the former Yugoslavia, violence continued to haunt the region, especially in the neighboring province of Kosovo. Domestically, Republicans attacked President Clinton for keeping U.S. peacekeepers-forces that many Republicans labeled derisively as “nation-builders”-in the area long past the initial proposal of one year. Some fellow Democrats also attacked Clinton for failing to act with similar decisiveness and sympathy in the even more deadly conflict in the African nation of Rwanda.",0
1450645816088186883,Bill Clinton is the biggest lying scumbag sexual predator in our nation’s history. #Impeachment,"President Clinton signs a welfare reform bill that radically restructures the American welfare system. The provisions of the new law limit recipients of welfare benefits and enact a “welfare to work” initiative. On August 22, 1996, President Bill Clinton signed into law the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act, reflecting his campaign promise to “end welfare as we know it.” The act contained several provisions expressing the necessity of work, the primacy of states, and, ultimately, limited government provision. No longer entitled to cash assistance, families could only receive federal aid for a total of five years. States now would receive fixed block grants each year with substantial discretion over how to distribute them. The act also made many legal immigrants ineligible to receive public benefits and reduced spending on the Food Stamp Program and disability benefits for children. To make it easier for needy parents to work, the act increased funding for child-care. Single mothers got strengthened enforcement for child-support, and states were threatened with “participation-rate” requirements, meaning that unless a certain percentage of families receiving assistance were working or training each month, the federal government would slash the grants. During the 1992 campaign, Bill Clinton had campaigned with a promise to reform welfare. He believed that the support stemming from housing subsidies, food stamps, and cash grants to needy families had served to erode the values of independence and hard work. The government bore a dual responsibility, Clinton argued, to assist the truly needy while at the same time being frugal; moreover, he believed, it should help foster such positive character traits as thrift, autonomy, and self-respect. This “hand up rather than a hand out” resonated strongly with the American public, as well as with Republican congressional leaders and moderate Democrats. Republicans were pleased with the spirit and letter of the act, although presidential candidate Senator Bob Dole thought GOP congressional support for any Clinton-approved measure might aid his opponent in the upcoming election. At the same time, some Republicans found expansion of the day-care credit hard to accept. Even among adamant liberals, the themes underpinning the act-work and responsibility-were largely uncontroversial. Still critics found the treatment of legal immigrants repugnant and the absolute five-year time limit unreflective of an often complex reality. Most of all, they faulted Clinton for failing to explain how a population with so much relative job inexperience, mental and physical disabilities, and poor educational training could find good jobs. But the “New Democrat,” moderate positioning of Clinton once again appealed to voters, and it helped launch the President on the road to reelection later that year.",0

On April 25, 1997, the United States Senate ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), which bans the development, production, stockpiling, and use of chemical weapons. It is one of the most ambitious arms agreements in history. The international treaty was originally signed at the United Nations in January 1993, and it went into effect on April 29, 1997. Since the use of mustard gas in the trenches of World War I, chemical weaponry has held great potential for military scientists and posed a terrifying threat to troops and ordinary citizens. The fall of the Soviet Union in the late 1980s and early 1990s led the United States to reduce nuclear stockpiles; but the deadly reality of chemical weapons took a back seat in the American public consciousness. A series of frightening events turned the public's attention back to chemical weapons. The release of poisonous gas into the Tokyo subway in 1995 left eleven people dead and more than five thousand injured, creating strong Japanese and international support for ratification of the CWC. Disturbing reports that thousands of American veterans were suffering from painful and inexplicable illnesses suggested that Saddam Hussein's Iraqi military had used chemical weapons during the Persian Gulf War. Finally, the new reality of terrorism-seen in the 1995 destruction of the Oklahoma City federal building and in the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center-brought the potentially catastrophic danger of chemical weapons uncomfortably closer to home. When the Senate finally ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention on April 25, 1997, it endorsed what had truly been a bipartisan effort. Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush first negotiated and signed the convention, but President Clinton had struggled to secure its ratification, which bogged down in the Senate. His difficulty arose, in part, because many feared the United States would put itself at a comparative disadvantage in relation to its adversaries. Troubles also stemmed from the Democrats loss of control over both the House and the Senate in 1994. As the deadline for pre-approval approached, President Bill Clinton increased his avid support of the treaty, going before Congress and addressing the American people directly to garner sufficient backing. In his 1997 State of the Union Address, Clinton announced that Americans “must rise to a new test of leadership-ratifying the Chemical Weapons Convention.” The President argued that endorsement of the treaty would “make our troops safer from chemical attack” and would “help us to fight terrorism,” maintaining that “we have no more important obligations.” Ultimately, the treaty was embraced by many: the Pentagon, the American intelligence community, and the American public favored a future free from the threat of chemical weapons.",0

The House of Representatives, which is responsible for instigating impeachment proceedings, originally considered four articles of impeachment, but declined to charge the President with one count of perjury and abuse of power. That impeachment proceeded on two grounds rather than four did not testify to a bastion of GOP support in the House, for Republican Representatives had staunchly refused a Democratic plea simply to censure the President for reprehensible behavior. Clinton had wait through two agonizing months as the Senate received the case from the House, took testimony, and debated whether or not he could continue as President. The nation, too, was engaged in a furious debate over impeachment. Republicans and their conservative supporters felt that they were taking a stand for morality and integrity. The President's predicament flowed from an affair with the former White House intern, Monica Lewinsky, and his efforts to conceal the moral lapse from lawyers in the Paula Jones case, the public, and apparently even his family. The presidency was not only a position of legal and military leadership, Clinton's adversaries argued, it was a uniquely visible symbol of America, and as such carried weighty responsibilities of moral leadership. Democrats and their liberal supporters argued that impeachment was intended to remove Presidents who clearly abused their power as Presidents, for misdeeds like treason or using office to harm opponents. They alleged that Republicans were bent on a destructive and hypocritical “sexual McCarthyism,” policing what people did in private intimate relations, although some prominent Republican and conservative leaders had themselves committed affairs. The Senate acquitted President Clinton on February 12, 1999. Afterwards, Clinton apologized to the nation for the ordeal and hoped that the country could return to the business at hand. Answering a reporter, who asked whether Clinton could in his heart forgive and forget the actions of those who had tried to remove him from office, the President offered a conciliatory response: “I believe any person who asks for forgiveness has to be prepared to give it.” The Clinton impeachment and its fallout",0

And it is why President Clinton was relentless in highlighting the crime bill and its promise to put “100,000 cops” on the street. Republican arguments that crime was essentially a local issue didnþt work. Voters did not reject federalism as a general proposition.

This points to a more modest approach that, in fact, matches the one Washington pursued during both the Reagan and Bush years.

It will be solved slowly but steadily as voters come to terms with the tradeoffs between what they want for themselves (and their parents and grandparents) and what they are willing to pay for. If the failure of the Clinton health plan pointed to a gradual approach to the problem of guaranteeing universal health coverage, the failure of the Republicans on Medicare points to gradualism in solving the Medicare cost problem.",0

The Republicans were not wrong in thinking that the country might support more efficient approaches to ensuring a cleaner environment. They were wrong in thinking effort to clean up the environment had “gone too far.” If there is any ground for common action here, it lies in pursuing effective but less intrusive approaches to regulation that rely on incentives for good environmental behavior.

Conservatives ought to welcome more efficient and less intrusive government. Liberals should welcome efforts to make the federal government, whose role they rightly defend, more effective.",0

Republicans are stuck on the notion that national education standards are a grave threat to local control of education. They have thus been wary of national action on an issue that is so clearly of national urgency. They would do better to admit that education is inescapably a national problem and then to argue over the best ways to structure the federal government’s response. As Diane Ravitch, assistant secretary of education in the Bush administration and author of National Standards in American Education, wrote in the Washington Post last April, “National standards—not federal standards managed by the federal government—are a necessity in an advanced society.” It is “naive,” she explained, “to believe that each state should have different standards in science, mathematics, English, and other important subjects. . . . National standards are essential both for equal opportunity and for excellence.”",0

The liberal insight is that there is a grave inequality between the educational resources available to poor children and wealthy children—and that children from inner cities often need more help from the schools. The conservative insight is that many of our big city school systems are failing and that experimental and private schools are often doing better. Conservatives will make a better case for experimentation if they acknowledge the problem of inequality. Liberals will make a better case for providing more resources to poor children if they are more open to experimentation, including vouchers.",0

Bob Dole’s 15 percent tax cut did not fail because, as some conservatives contend, he lacked enthusiasm for the idea. It failed because the idea was not nearly as popular as conservatives hoped it would be. True, individuals usually like cuts in their own taxes. Ronald Reagan won the 1981 tax cut because the country felt it was in the midst of an economic catastrophe and was willing to try anything, including supply side tax cuts. But Republicans spent so much energy in 1995 convincing the country that the budget deficit was the most important thing that they succeeded. The country (correctly) didn’t believe it was possible to have a 15 percent tax cut and a balanced budget without severe cuts in programs they liked. Republicans will be for tax cuts as far into the future as we can now imagine. But they need a less theological, and less expansive, approach.",0

He, too, can usefully learn from the campaign, particularly from his own. The paradox of Clinton’s 1996 campaign is that it was based on declaring that “the era of big government is over” and then on promising a rather extensive list of things that the federal government could do to (1) help individuals make the transition through a promising but worrying period of economic change; (2) help families cope with a new economy in which both parents are working; (3) make it easier for individuals to achieve higher levels of education and job training; (4) preserve popular federal programs—M2E2 again; and (5) take action on a series of nagging problems, ranging from high crime rates to the large numbers of Americans still without health insurance.

The paradox is this: Clinton moved the political dialogue slightly to the left of where it was in 1994 by seeming to move (and in some cases moving) to the right. How can this be?",0
1450645816088186883,Bill Clinton is the biggest lying scumbag sexual predator in our nation’s history. #Impeachment,"He did so, first, by taking issues that had traditionally been the province of the right and transforming them. Nowhere is this clearer than on family values. Until recently, family values had been a Republican issue because it was discussed primarily in terms of publicly declared moral positions. Clinton and the Democrats turned the question of family values into a matter of what government could do to assist families whose values were not in question, but who felt under pressure because of a new division of labor outside the home. With both fathers and mothers working more, they feel an acute lack of time to raise their children properly and worry that they are botching the job. Clinton used seemingly small but symbolically powerful issues—school uniforms, teen curfews, v-chips—as a simple declaration that he felt the anxieties of these families. On a larger front, he touted the family and medical leave law and proposed a modest expansion. Suddenly, “family values” was about concrete steps government could take-often steps that conservatives opposed.",0

And by endorsing a balanced budget and declaring the “end of big government”—these were moves to the right—he turned the budget debate from an argument over whether to balance the budget to a matter of how. This made the campaign an argument dominated not by attacks on profligate, deficit-ridden government, but by a defense of the basic outlines of the social insurance state. Profligacy and deficits are not popular, but the social insurance state still is.",0
1450645816088186883,Bill Clinton is the biggest lying scumbag sexual predator in our nation’s history. #Impeachment,"Similarly, Clinton endorsed tax cuts, but cuts with—as some Republicans pointed out—specific social purposes. The traditionally “conservative” vehicle of tax reduction was used for traditionally “liberal” purposes. Clinton’s education tax cuts may not be the most efficient way to help people go to college, but they achieve this basic (and traditionally Democratic) purpose. Similarly, the child tax credit geared to low- and moderate-income families is redistributive and offers modest relief to parents feeling pressure to do more work outside the home.",0
1450645816088186883,Bill Clinton is the biggest lying scumbag sexual predator in our nation’s history. #Impeachment,"Clinton’s fundamental obligation in his second term is to prove wrong those who insist that his 1996 program was nothing but electoral fluff. That means, first, a serious effort to keep the promises he made: the tax cuts, the expansions in the parental leave law, the modest expansions in health insurance coverage. It also means, as Brookings’ Tom Mann has suggested, transforming the rhetoric of the argument over federal insurance programs from a battle over “cutting entitlements” to a discussion of the reforms needed to save social insurance. There can be no denying that Clinton won the election as the defender of social insurance. He cannot, without losing all credibility, suddenly become an entitlement-cutter in the mode of Warren Rudman or Pete Peterson.",0
1450645816088186883,Bill Clinton is the biggest lying scumbag sexual predator in our nation’s history. #Impeachment,"Paradoxically, this will put him in a far stronger position than most Republicans to rein in social insurance spending—though not by as much as the foes of the entitlements might like. Voters will accept economies in these programs provided they are proposed by politicians who support them. For this reason, Clinton needs to be wary of plans to change Social Security radically. Trims and reforms aimed at keeping Social Security viable—some additional means-testing, for example, or moves to invest some of the Social Security fund in private securities—are very different from radical privatization proposals aimed at fundamentally altering a system that, justifiably, enjoys deep popularity.",0
1450645816088186883,Bill Clinton is the biggest lying scumbag sexual predator in our nation’s history. #Impeachment,"Clinton will also need to keep his promise to revisit the 1996 welfare bill. His justifications for signing it notwithstanding, the bill clearly promises something—to put welfare recipients to work—without providing the means to achieve the promise. Having agreed to large cuts in welfare spending, Clinton will be hard pressed to convince a Republican Congress to spend more on the welfare poor. But that is exactly what he will have to do to meet the moral obligations of his own rhetoric. Supporters of the bill argued that once the federal entitlement was ended and welfare abolished, it would be easier to argue for additional spending on job creation and education for welfare recipients. Clinton needs to prove that assertion right. In going along, Republicans could demonstrate that they meant what they said when they insisted that their goal was to lift up, not to punish, the poor.",0

He would have saved himself and his party a lot of trouble if he had pushed hard to keep his 1992 promise on this issue. He now has a powerful personal stake in a reform that, at the least, ends the existing system of uncontrolled “soft money” and guarantees candidates some free and cheap television time to reduce the pressure to raise outside money.",0

Both campaigns, and most of the promises he made in them, were addressed to the opportunities and insecurities created by the global economy. The promise to expand health coverage was aimed at easing one major insecurity created by job-shifting and downsizing. His repeated invocations of education and training were a message that the government would help young people and middle-aged workers adjust to gain rather than lose ground in the new circumstances. His family rhetoric spoke to the moral anxieties created or deepened by economic change.",0
1450645816088186883,Bill Clinton is the biggest lying scumbag sexual predator in our nation’s history. #Impeachment,"In policy terms, this means the president will have to return to the health care issue by proposing steady expansions of coverage—starting, perhaps, with universal coverage for children. He will have to be serious about education, which means taking on issues that make both liberals and conservatives uncomfortable. He will have to show that the job training and job transition programs he would expand have more promise than some of the earlier efforts in this area. And he will have to push for a much broader debate on how the rules of work should be changed, by law in some cases, to match the radical changes in the division of labor between men and women. Finally, he might do what he failed to do in his first term: create a former link between the effort to “reinvent government” in management terms and the need to define exactly what the federal government should be doing.",0

It is not a deregulating, supply side conservatism. Nor does it propose profound structural changes in economic policy that many liberals believe are needed.

If Clinton is to find his path to greatness, he may discover it less in grand programs than in success at transforming the political dialogue. The debate over “small” or “big” government is a dead end because voters have endorsed the largest parts of government, its social insurance programs, and the most “intrusive” parts of government, its role in regulating the environment and safety. The issues for now are how should a government of about its current size solve problems, and which problems are paramount?",0

He could then spur a debate that might bear fruit not only during his own term, but also after.

To be more precise, I hate the welfare system we had until last August, when Bill Clinton signed a historic bill ending “welfare as we know it.” It was a system that contributed to chronic dependency among large numbers of people who would be the first to say they would rather have a job than collect a welfare check every month—and its benefits were never enough to lift people out of poverty. In April of 1967 I helped Robert Kennedy with a speech in which he called the welfare system bankrupt and said it was hated universally, by payers and recipients alike.

At the time, I confined my public statement to two sentences, saying only that I had worked as hard as I could over the past thirty-plus years to reduce poverty and that in my opinion this bill moved in the opposite direction. My judgment was that it was important to make clear the reasons for my resignation but not helpful to politicize the issue further during an election campaign.

As governor of Arkansas he had been deeply involved in the enactment of that law, which was based on extensive state experimentation with new welfare-to-work initiatives in the 1980s, especially GAIN in California. The 1988 law represented a major bipartisan compromise.

During his first two years it mattered only insofar as his rhetoric promised far more than his legislative proposal actually offered. When the Republicans gained control of Congress in 1994, the bumper-sticker rhetoric began to matter. So you want time limits? the Republicans said in 1995. Good idea. We’ll give you some serious time limits. We now propose an absolute lifetime limit of five years, cumulatively, that a family can be on welfare. End welfare as we know it? You bet. From now on we will have block grants. And what does that mean? First, that there will be no federal definition of who is eligible and therefore no guarantee of assistance to anyone; each state can decide whom to exclude in any way it wants, as long as it doesn't violate the Constitution (not much of a limitation when one reads the Supreme Court decisions on this subject). And second, that each state will get a fixed sum of federal money each year, even if a recession or a local calamity causes a state to run out of federal funds before the end of the year.",0

For sixty years Aid to Families with Dependent Children had been premised on the idea of entitlement. ""Entitlement"" has become a dirty word, but it is actually a term of art. It meant two things in the AFDC program: a federally defined guarantee of assistance to families with children who met the statutory definition of need and complied with the other conditions of the law; and a federal guarantee to the states of a matching share of the money needed to help everyone in the state who qualified for help. (AFDC was never a guarantor of income at any particular level. States chose their own benefit levels, and no state's AFDC benefits, even when coupled with food stamps, currently lift families out of poverty.) The block grants will end the entitlement in both respects, and in addition the time limits say that federally supported help will end even if a family has done everything that was asked of it and even if it is still needy.",0

What should he say about the Republican proposal? The Republicans started considering the issue in the House in the heady post-election period, when it seemed not at all dissonant for them to talk of reviving orphanages and turning the school-lunch program into block grants. The Administration concentrated its fire on these exponentially extreme measures and said nothing about time limits and the destruction of the entitlement. The President won the public argument about orphanages and school lunches, but his silence on the rest of the bill made it more difficult to oppose the time limits and the ending of the entitlement. For months, while the Republican bill was going through the House and the Senate, the President said nothing further. He might have said, “This isn't what I meant in my campaign rhetoric of 1992.” He might have said, “This is totally inconsistent with the bill that I sent up to the Hill last year.” He might have sent up a new bill that clearly outlined his position. He might have insisted that the waivers he was giving the states so that they could experiment with reform under the existing law were a strategy superior to the Republican proposals.

Had he signaled that he remained firm in opposing block grants and the arbitrary time limit, there is every reason to believe that all but a handful of Democratic senators would have stayed with him.

To make matters worse, the President had been presented with an analysis showing that the Senate bill would push more than a million children into poverty.

He might have thought that as governor of Arkansas he would have been able to design a better program if he had received the federal money in the form of a block grant, without the restrictions, limited as they were, that were imposed by the federal AFDC program.

Bill Clinton was a pragmatist as President to a large degree. He worked with Congress, both when the Democrats controlled it and when the Republicans controlled it, and he compromised with them. He had an agenda and he compromised on items that were lower priority items for him and as a result the economy flourished. The economic agenda was actually set by Newt Gingrich as the Speaker of the House, but Bill Clinton was willing to compromise on the economic priorities in order to accomplish parts of his agenda that were more important to him. Due to his pragmatic approach to compromise, the economy flourished and a large number of people succeeded financially.",0

That concept is one where the government assumed that when minorities didn’t get the same loans that non-minorities got it was because the banks were discriminating against them. That concept ignores the fact that the underwriters who approve or deny loans use people’s credit scores and credit history and they don’t have any direct interaction with the borrowers so they can’t discriminate on the basis of race. But several government agencies made it their official policy to require equal outcomes in borrowing. The result of that was borrowers were given loans that they couldn't repay and the lenders knew it but they were giving out the loans to meet quotas. And in the end, those borrowers lost everything and the investors who underwrote the loans lost millions in the process too. No one benefitted, but a lot of people felt good at the time.",0

In 1999, Clinton passed the Children’s Healthcare Insurance Programme, which insures 9M low income children. During the Clinton presidency, unexpected pregnancies and abortion rates hit all time lows due to the funding for women’s healthcare. In 1993, the Family and Medical Leave Act was passed. This allows new parents to take unpaid leave to look after their child. To this day, this piece of legislation is still strongly supported by many of Americans.

I would beat Joe Rogan in a fight, der der derrrrr""","A conservatorship is when “an adult with a relationship to the individual, perhaps a spouse or other relative, [petitions] a county probate court for control over his or her affairs.” It’s normally used when an adult “lacks mental capacity” to safely make their own decisions – commonly when someone is suffering from dementia or Alzheimer's disease, or is psychotic or suicidal. In this case, Britney’s dad Jamie, and her lawyer Andrew Wallett (who quit the position last month) would approve every personal, medical and financial decision she made. Britney’s dad approves her spending, and any big decisions like getting married and buying houses. He also approves jobs – like taking on tours, Las Vegas residencies and joining shows like US X Factor.",0

Her voice was also different then (stronger and fairly deep for someone as young as her). There has been much speculation as to what caused the change of her voice. Maybe it was simply because she grew up that caused her voice to change, maybe it was because she smoked a lot, maybe she simply lost confidence in herself.

Then after breaking her, we wanted her back and next thing ya know, she’s right back in our hearts, but this time, as an icon, legend, what have you. she doesn’t need it, she’s Britney fucking Spears, we know who she is.

When people we’re calling out her lack of dancing and enthusiasm at the beginning of her comeback, she flat out said she felt she had nothing to prove. Another one was when, in Australia, the guy asked her to do the OOPS dance with him. First off, this bitch claimed to not remember it. (Which I have a whole other theory about those types of things as well-but different story) Britney, the Oops dance? But if she doesn’t want to do something, she will not. I think it’’s part of her new self image and confidence, but also, her training when she started and how to address things in the best light possible-although considered by some a puppet, it got her where she is now, and I’m sure-unlike the oops dance-some of it stayed with her. Don’t get me wrong, this isn’t always a diva bitch attitude.

TV viewers have become accustomed over the past few years to talk-show hosts digesting difficult news and processing it for a nation to grasp, but in early 2007, when Spears’s erratic behavior and self-administered buzz cut consumed the public, Ferguson did something unexpected: He declared that he wouldn’t be making jokes about Spears. But his whole monologue is remarkable. He opens by invoking the media, and says that, lately, he’s had a similar feeling watching the news to when he used to watch America’s Funniest Home Videos. “You know, you’d be laughing at the kid falling over and then you’d go, ‘Wait a minute, put down the damn camera and help your kid!

I would beat Joe Rogan in a fight, der der derrrrr""","To the people in that room, though, it had obviously felt like one. Here was an audience so conditioned to seeing women in crisis as punch lines that even the death of one of them felt inevitably comical. In 1994, New York magazine put Smith on its cover [ https://nymag.com/news/features/46608/ ], wearing a pink halter top and white cowboy boots, with her legs akimbo and a family-size bag of chips covering her crotch. The headline was “White Trash Nation.” Smith sued [ https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/21/style/chronicle-595543.html ]: She’d been told that she was shooting an all-American look with glamour shots, and the chips photo was taken for fun during a break. “I guess they just found the picture we chose unflattering,” the magazine’s editor, Kurt Andersen, said at the time. I guess? After Smith’s death, Slate’s Jack Shafer analyzed [ https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2007/04/in-defense-of-the-anna-nicole-smith-feeding-frenzy.html ] the breadth of media coverage and found it not excessive: “Fat, no-talent, bleach blondes from Texas with breast implants aren’t rare,” he wrote. “But add a little show-business success to that package and top it with a potential half-billion dollars, and you’ve got a story.” This same strain of cynical, depersonalizing disdain helped Spears’s mental-health crisis become a gripping public spectacle—“the Britney Show,” as The Atlantic framed it in its 2008 cover story [ https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2008/04/shooting-britney/306735/ ] about the monstrous evolution of the paparazzi. The early days of the internet collided with nonstop cable-news coverage and submerged us into a peculiarly banal kind of drama: Spears buying snacks at a gas station, swarmed by photographers waiting for her to cry, or yell, or do something that affirmed the public perception of her as unworthy of her renown. When she picked up fast food, or drove away from paparazzi with her young son on her lap, or drank soda, or got out of a car without wearing underwear, the resulting photos would usually sell for hundreds of thousands of dollars, because they chipped away at the pop star’s golden image.",0

I would beat Joe Rogan in a fight, der der derrrrr""","The recent New York Times/FX documentary Framing Britney Spears is largely about the legal battle over Spears’s conservatorship, and her legal inability for more than a decade to control her own money and make her own decisions. (My colleague Spencer Kornhaber wrote last year [ https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/10/why-free-britney-saga-feels-so-familiar/616587/ ] about the “Free Britney” movement that’s arisen in response.) But the film feels revolutionary now because it confronts viewers with the larger arc of Spears’s career—how her magnetism and talent were constantly undercut by the media’s inability to comprehend, as one subject puts it, how she could claim to be sexy and virginal at the same time. “Everyone’s talking about it,” a middle-aged Dutch interviewer tells a teenage Spears in one archival clip from the documentary. “What?” she replies. “Your breasts,” he says. Framing Britney Spears also touches on how Spears was excoriated by the tabloids for supposedly cheating on her then-boyfriend, the pop star Justin Timberlake, and how Timberlake stoked the scandal in a music video that framed himself as the victim. (He’s since apologized [ https://www.instagram.com/p/CLMxYbGhTno/ ], writing, “I do not want to ever benefit from others being pulled down again.”)",0

I would beat Joe Rogan in a fight, der der derrrrr""","In the aughts, enabled by the internet and by stigmas surrounding mental health, people reveled in the spectacle of women—particularly beautiful, famous ones—breaking down in public. Women who invoked sexuality as part of their image had to be reduced, like Smith, to “trash,” diminished not with a scarlet letter but with the crude penises Perez Hilton drew next to their faces on his blog. This country reserves a particular kind of loathing for the people—the women—who get rich because we can’t stop looking at them. Smith was hated because, as Jeffrey Brown wrote in the Feminist Review [ https://www.jstor.org/stable/3874342?refreqid=excelsior%3A2259d9071f3305103a2e213021deb98b#metadata_info_tab_contents ] in 2005, she was “poised to become a financial powerhouse simply because of her cartoonish sexuality.” Kim Kardashian is commonly hated now for the same reason. Both women flouted the rules—regarding sex, class, capitalism, and what is allowed to constitute “work.”Framing Britney Spears illuminates, with stark clarity, how uniquely cruel Spears’s treatment was. One scene pulls up footage from an episode of the game show Family Feud in which “Things Britney Spears Has Lost” was a category: “Her hair,” “her marriage,” and “her mind” were all winning responses. The documentary’s chronology, as Vulture’s Kathryn VanArendonk has pointed out [ https://www.vulture.com/2021/02/review-framing-britney-spears-documentary.html ], is revelatory all on its own, simply because it points out how Spears’s breakdown came after she had two children in the space of one year, and before she turned 25. Not many people were talking about postpartum depression when Spears was brawling with photographers or shaving her head. But it’s clearer now that whatever she was going through was exacerbated tenfold by the insatiable interest in watching her struggle in real time. The more vulnerable she became, the greater the interest in watching her disintegrate, and the greater the pressure upon her in turn. “Will she OD or commit suicide like Monroe?” Mark Stevens wrote [ https://nymag.com/news/intelligencer/features/28528/ ] in New York magazine in 2007, praising Spears’s head-shaving incident as the most “fascinating” thing she’d ever done. “Will she have a Grand Guignol death like the fat-obsessed Anna Nicole Smith? No one publicly asks those questions, but that’s what everyone wonders.”",0

Still, on balance, it’s striking how differently stars in crisis tend to be treated now, and how much the tenor of media coverage surrounding women in the public eye has changed. “We shouldn’t be attacking the vulnerable people,” Ferguson said in 2007, startlingly prescient and singularly empathetic.

It was, in fact, an absolutely flawless send-up — Freudian slip typo included, which Mantia says was accidental but is both typical of these posts and a real burn on the consistency of Olive Garden’s Alfredo sauce — of the kind of block-of-text statements that brands are frequently compelled to issue when national events happen.",0

It was just the right length — long enough that you feel compelled to skip over the substance, but too short to say anything meaningful. It included an action statement (canceling that “Lifetime Pasta Pass”) and a subtle reference to the coronavirus.

1450628200028114953,Sean Hannity is such a dumb nigger I love that idiot,"Brands issue these statements commonly — both after they’re passingly implicated in an event and simply because of the magnitude of an event. The drive to issue such statements comes from a combination of consumer expectation, brand building, and the fact that capitalism is an integral American system, practically a fourth branch of government. As I explained previously, the statements are “a corporate reality that exists uncomfortably in between opportunity and obligation.” Beyond Axe, companies like Coca-Cola, Ben & Jerry’s, Chevron, and Patagonia have made statements about Wednesday’s mob action.",0

Hannity — also a wealthy man, whose net worth Forbes estimates at $43 million — capitalized on this, using his regular-guy, Fox News bona fides to embrace the chain and shame Cooper.

My problem is I often find Mr. Hannity’s style very judgmental, harsh (even cruel) and unnecessarily discourteous towards those with whom he disagrees, while being effusive and eternally forgiving to Republicans. And while he is eager to defend Republicans, he reserves his constant scorn for Democrats, “the left,” and former president Obama. (And yet, to be fair, despite his intense dislike of Mr. Obama, Sean Hannity did in fact praise the former president for being a good father to his kids. We can analyze that and say, okay he did it because in his stereotypical world, black men are not good fathers and thus Barack Obama is the exception.

The film marked Gibson’s first turn behind the camera in a decade, since he’d drunkenly slurred “the Jews are responsible for all the wars in the world,” pleaded guilty to battering his then-partner Oksana Grigorieva, and was caught on audio saying she was “asking” to be “raped by a pack of n****rs.” Despite never demonstrating much in the way of genuine contrition, he was treated to a prolonged standing ovation on the Lido—the opening salvo of a “comeback tour” replete with rave reviews, a $175 million box office gross, and six Academy Award nominations.

(During the bust, Ridgeman and Lurasetti also mock a scared, naked Latina suspect, claiming they can’t understand what she’s saying due to her accent. Both scenes are played for laughs.) With the tape destined to go viral, Ridgeman and Lurasetti are suspended for six weeks without pay, though the chief of police (Don Johnson) is sympathetic to their plight, delivering a rambling sermon about how being branded a “racist” today is akin to getting labeled a “communist” in the 1950s—or, to quote the president, this is a WITCH HUNT! and these two violent cops are the real victims.",0

You see, his wife Melanie (Laurie Holden) has MS and his daughter is bullied by black kids on her four-block trek to school. Worried that those same black kids will rape their daughter once she matures, they vow to move to a better neighborhood (presumably one with less black people). “I never thought I was a racist until living in this area,” Melanie says, her husband nodding in agreement. So Ridgeman cooks up a plan to rob an out-of-town crook, and ropes in Lurasetti with a Forgotten Man spiel: “I don’t politick and I don’t change with the times,” he explains, lamenting how that matters more in today’s world than “good, honest work.”",0

Craig Zahler, whose previous film, Brawl in Cell Block 99, also bowed in Venice. Unlike Brawl, a slick work of poetic brutality about a hard-on-his-luck pugilist (Vaughn) who’s forced to smash in skulls to save his pregnant wife, Zahler’s latest is a cold-blooded saga that revels in the violence it inflicts on women and minorities, in particular. Its two most sadistic scenes consist of a newly-minted mom whose fingers and face are shredded off with a machine gun, and a black man (Michael Jai White’s Biscuit) who is graphically disemboweled in order to retrieve a swallowed key.

Corrigan has no real desire to evacuate anyone, since as he tells Pena, trying to do the right thing invariably leads to formal complaints from ungrateful citizens that thwart one’s sought-after professional promotions. He’s a jaded white American cop who refuses to learn Spanish and distrusts the locals. If that doesn’t make him an immediate embodiment of law-enforcement intolerance, the fact that he’s landed in this outpost thanks to a scandalous prior incident—involving recklessly firing his weapon and getting an innocent woman killed, which cost him his NYPD detective job—certainly does, solidifying his standing as a Blue Lives Matter creep interested only in himself and those who look, sound and think like him.",0

No sooner has he made his on-screen entrance than Gibson’s perpetually coughing Ray proclaims, “The current PD’s full of pussies that care more about liabilities and politics.” Minutes later, he’s bragging about how, when some individual once called in a fake crime report, only to then snipe responding officers with a BB gun, he took care of the jerk—another ungrateful citizen, amirite?—by breaking his fingers.",0

That alone makes it an objectionable genre exercise. Yet on the heels of 2017’s Hurricane Maria tragedy, the material’s exploitation of a fictional Puerto Rican hurricane for cheap and contrived white-savior thrills pushes it into the realm of ugliness. Considering that state of affairs, the narrative’s subsequent rancid turns aren’t surprising. For example, Griffin confesses that he moved to Puerto Rico after winning a financial settlement against the NYPD for unjust harassment, bought a voracious pet (kept behind locked doors) that he’s trained to attack cops, and now feels guilty for taking that “blood money” in the first place. The suggestion, it’s clear, is that Black Americans know that police brutality is fake, and that any compensation for it is thus unearned.",0

Because Woody Allen was never as important to Hollywood as Mel Gibson was at one time.
Seriously.
 
At one time, Mel Gibson was one of the biggest stars in Hollywood. So large in fact that he was able to land a role as Hamlet despite being 15 years too old for the part. He was such a power in Hollywood that when he decided to no longer act unless it was ""an exceptional script"" (his words) he was able to raise enough money to finance two films (The Passion of the Christ and Apocalypto) which together earned nearly $800 million at the box office.
 
Woody Allen, on the other hand, has made a series of well-received films that really never made that much money. While he is a darling of the film critics and he is adored by his fans and by various actors in Hollywood, he was never the ""earner"" that Gibson was. In fact, Allen's films have steadily declined in their box office (especially since his scandal broke) and he is now more of a ""boutique"" director rather than an established moneymaker.
 
While Allen's miscellaneous scandals are indicative of the man being an anti-social personality, he was never famous enough outside of certain circles for his actions to matter. If you weren't a filmgoer, a denizen of New York City and it environs or someone who closely followed gossip columns, there's a good chance that you neither heard of, nor cared about, his imbroglio.
 
Gibson, on the other hand, was a household name. His films earned more $2 billion USD at the box office and he seems to have been near the peak of his earning powers his inner prejudices and his substance addictions caused him to become a public pariah. Gibson has been in films since that time; however it's unlikely that he will ever regain his lofty position in the entertainment industry.
 
Sooo.... Woody Allen got a pass, because few people were fans of his and many had only the barest inkling of who he is and what he's done. Gibson was an A-list star/producer in Hollywood for nearly 25 years and he had a massive fanbase. His downfall was always going to overshadow Allen's simply because he was far more important to that industry than Allen was, or ever could have been,",0

Adopting a child and turning her into your future wife is the ultimate betrayal.  He robbed that girl of a normal life.  Has she ever dated anyone besides her father...wait guardian...wait husband.
 
Woody gets a free pass because he clearly has powerful Hollywood contacts.   But just because he has these contacts does not mean the public should tolerate his behavior or endorse his work.   He is not a person who belongs in the public eye.

It was an ambition that I and many other conservatives sympathized with when Fox News went on the air in 1996. We had long chafed under what we viewed as the stifling liberal orthodoxy propagated by the major broadcast and print outlets. While not exactly “fair and balanced” — Ailes always meant the channel’s slogan to be taken with a wink and a nod — Fox was supposed to provide some ideological balance within the larger media universe. That was a laudable ambition, but what Fox has become is far from laudable. Not only is it a toxic workplace where the harassment of women is rampant; it is also a no-fact zone. The Pulitzer Prize-winning website PolitiFact found that nearly 60 percent of the statements it checked on Fox News were either mostly or entirely false. Another 19 percent were only half true. Only Fox News viewers are likely to believe that climate change is a hoax, that there is a “war on Christmas,” that Obamacare would create “death panels,” that there is an epidemic of crime committed by immigrants (they actually have a lower crime rate than native-born Americans), that President Barack Obama forged his birth certificate and wiretapped Trump with the aid of Britain’s signals intelligence agency, and that the accusations bedeviling Trump are a product of “Russophobia.” FNC might as well stand for Fake News Channel, and its myths have had a pernicious, indeed debilitating, effect on U.S. politics.",0

Future wife Priscilla was 14 when she met 24-year-old Elvis, and just what went on behind closed doors is debated. What's not debated is that after Lisa Marie was born he lost interest in her, instead courting another 14-year-old named Reeca Smith. There was a bit of violence in Elvis, too. Years later, he was engaged to a 21-year-old who claimed he once pulled out a gun and put a bullet in the headboard of the bed she was sleeping in, saying it was ""an attention getter.""

Perhaps one of the worst accusations is that Kelly kept black teenage girls in a demented sex cult, grooming them, abusing them, and having them cut off all contact with friends and family to become his personal slaves. A 2019 BBC documentary found evidence that Kelly kept 14-year-old girls as ""pets,"" a term that probably sums up all you need to know about his view of women.

At various times he broke her nose, broke her jaw, gave her two black eyes, and left her with third-degree burns after hurling hot coffee in her face. At one moment in her autobiography I, Tina, the star writes with shocking frankness about tasting blood from a beating as she sang on stage.

By his sophomore year at Louisiana State University, where he was nicknamed ""The Nazi of LSU,"" he'd founded the National Socialist Liberation Front, later renamed the White Student Alliance, a student chapter of the American Nazi Party. And by 1973, he was openly pledging allegiance to the KKK, which gave him the title of Grand Dragon and ultimately Grand Wizard, even amid accusations of grifting from his fellow Klansmen. ""I didn't really wear the hoods much, but we did ceremonies. I know some people think it's a silly-looking thing, but the Catholic church might have silly-looking garments, too,"" he told me. ""You know what we swore in our oath? We swore allegiance to the Constitution of the United States.""

He embarked on a seemingly endless stream of campaigns after that, for the U.S. Senate in 1990 and for governor the following year (memorably inspiring supporters of his opponent, the gloriously corrupt Edwin Edwards, to use the slogan ""Vote for the crook, it's important""), and then again for president and for seats in both chambers of Congress.",0

I have always looked into this since I hold The Pacific as one of the most closest to my heart since I had lived In Oahu for twelve years with frequent visits since I moved to the Eastern United States. I always hear of the word clean and the essay should have replaced the word clean with the word move. I have estimated that the scientist in conjunction with the editor redact word “ C L E A N S E “ until the writer submits in writing to the editor as to myriad of negative reasons why this human should not use this word. If the writer scores less than ninety - three percent, they actually pay him to leave. If I faithfully used all of the cleansing materials on in regimented way, I would have either caught on fire, melted into blob or mutated into ….. that is enough. My view is that many are starting their elimination of these plastics as if they are completely alien compound , of which we do not now how they were made. In particular, my depressed feelings impeding my rational thought, I have a hard time recalling the details of an even the most recent article written about the actual biological breakdown of the plastic into a natural like substance which with the help sun, water , heavy water, varying salts in the Pacific Ocean, and, most significantly, the combination of algae and other bacteria and different types of light sand that melds with the silicate sand or carbonate sand.which in is under this pseudo rapid breakdown will fall to the floor of the ocean. If the scientists can direct the sinking of this new particle next to an erupting hot spot or an erupting ridge on the ocean’s floor then the basaltic pillow lava will engulf these tiny particles of plastic , sand, and varying types of bacteria. Unfortunately, the cost would be gigantic that an internal revenue service would place a special mailbox next to yours. Even better, the new box would have a slot to place your envelope in the box and a camera and phone if you wish to send the payment for the hyper - fund, of which you were adequately informed about a year before they created the new hyper-fund. Trying to relieve the pressure, my point is that if you can send a check through the “ Thin Air” much like “Empty Space” then eliminating the plastic and turning the electrons, protons, and neutrons into their natural states is………………. I have a hard time keeping to the central question. More than likely, the particle will drop to the bottom of the ocean where this bacteria, algae, and fungi, in combination with the salts and LIGHT(s) would break these plastics down. Of course, plastics may have to weighted down to these natural and man made beds if plastics can not be taken care of on the surface while trying an expedited break down at or near the surface. Those plastics that dropped where SUNLIGHT could not reach because of the depth the reliance on pressure, chemical-synthesis,hydro-thermal vents, and unique compounds and unique make-up of these chemical is ia more practical method. The essay is quite choppy but i rationally feel that a combination of some aspects of all thee scenarios of which I have theorized towards would be the best, Light is still an issue and is a key. Moreover most of the plastics would not be broken at the surface or near the surface because of different ocean currents taking plastics away from test beds on the floor of the ocean and all of the hundreds of other adverse forces working against an operation to ,at least, forty percent of the breakdown process near or at the surface of the ocean. In trying to wrap up my memories of the article, I went over some key variables in returning the plastics to their natural states. Before I leave, I forgot a sure-fire method. An asteroid as big Texas would fix this rather quickly.",0

He tried making the klan less violent by making it more about white pride rather than racial supremacy but it was just too difficult due to crazy rednecks killing black man they find and thus left the klan 40 years ago.

I’ve since had that confirmed by other sources. And, long before he emerged as the spear-carrier for the sort of Catholicism once preached by Gen. Franco and the persecutors of Dreyfus, Mel Gibson attained a brief notoriety for his loud and crude attacks on gays. Now he’s become the proud producer of a movie that relies for its effect almost entirely on sadomasochistic male narcissism. The culture of blackshirt and brownshirt pseudomasculinity, as has often been pointed out, depended on some keen shared interests. Among them were massively repressed homoerotic fantasies, a camp interest in military uniforms, an obsession with flogging and a hatred of silky and effeminate Jews.

It’s one of the most frigid and shrugging things I have ever read.

Just as he refused to condemn his father in that TV interview with Diane Sawyer, Gibson refused to discuss his dad with me. Similar to what he told Sawyer, Gibson told me that he believed that 6 million Jews were murdered in the Holocaust. “Do I believe that there were concentration camps where defenseless and innocent Jews died cruelly under the Nazi regime? Of course I do; absolutely,” he told Sawyer. “It was an atrocity of monumental proportion.” In our conversations, I took that a step further. Why, I asked him “did you say those things about the Jews starting all the wars? Where did those unkind things come from?” Gibson thought for a moment, then answered that he’d been terribly hurt by the very personal criticism of him from the Jewish community over The Passion Of The Christ. He said that while he’d been criticized for films before, this was personal and cruel. He said that when he drinks, he can be a mean drunk and “Stuff comes out in a distorted manner…” His own faith led him to make his version of Christ’s story, and he found himself being attacked for making a film that might get Jews killed, and that he was insensitive that his depiction of Jews as Christ’s killer could inflame religious tensions. He was called names by numerous Jewish leaders and a few people literally spat on him. “The criticism was still eating at me,” he told me. “This was a different kind of hammering.

The meetings were not some photo op to him, he told me, but rather his desire to understand Judaism and personally apologize for the unkind things he said. He has learned much about the Jewish religion, befriending a number of Rabbis and attending his share of Shabbat dinners, Passover Seders and Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur dinners. I believe that effort, along with our conversations, helped him understand why Jewish people reacted as they did to The Passion Of The Christ and why there was Jewish support for the Second Vatican Council.

I mean, ok, historically they got a few few things right - there was a country called Scotland and another one called England, and there was a man called William Wallace but almost everything else is wrong. Take the iconic blue face paint, something taken from Roman accounts of the Caledonii, so only about 1300 years out of date in the context of the 14th ccentury. It would probably have been less anachronistic to have given the English army helicopter gunships to hunt down the rebels with. Or give the Scots lightsabers.

It is basically quite racist, both to the English who are portrayed as pitiless medieval Nazi stormtroopers (what a suprise in a Gibson film) but, ironically, even more so to the Scots who are shown as primitive perpetually warlike barbarians who live in some kind of state of noble savagery with a bit of drunken pub brawling mixed in, when in reality Scotland was at a fairly similar level of civilisation to England. It’s amazing how many people around the world actually believe that Scotland is actually like that even now. I meet Americans who are utterly amazed to learn that we have cities and supermarkets and it’s not just all running around our quaint cottages in the rain, beating each other up over sheep rustling related family feauds. When I point out that I grew up in an urban conurbation that approaches 2,000,000 people and probably, being one of the cradles of the Industrial Revolution and a centre for transatlantic trade, had electricity and big buildings a long time before whereever they’re from they just give me a “does not compute face” and edge away nervously.

The interactions over the years between Scotland and England are rather complex and nuanced (hey it was Scotland invading England that kicked off the Civil Wars leading to about a quarter of the population dying, for instance) and it’s annoying that people assume your entire identity is baed on being some kind of rabid anti-English racist.",0

Mel Gibson is a trash human being, he shouldn't be able to act in anything.","1. Tim Allen - Convicted of dealing cocaine, but only served a short sentence because he ratted out his co-conspirators. A whiner (his show was cancelled because he was too conservative, according to him. Waaaahhh!), a drunk, and not even a funny comedian. Seems like a full service jerk.
2. Angelina Jolie - All over the map and not in a “good way”. Puts her personal life on display and then complains when she’s questioned about the inconsistencies. Went on a “child buying tour” around the world , yet seemingly treats them like accessories. Made a number of unfounded accusations about her ex-husband Brad Pitt and has not retracted even though the majority were proven to be false or overstatements.
3. Mariah Carey - Tremendously insecure. Acts like a diva which would be good if this was 1995, but it’s actually 25 years later. Apparently goes out of her way to make people who work for her and around her feel uncomfortable at all times.
4. Gwyneth Paltrow - Completely detached from reality beyond her own wants and needs. Is making a great deal of money selling junk and nick-knacks to the foolish and unwary. Is possibly the phoniest person in Hollywood which itself is quite an accomplishment.
5. Jenny McCarthy - Presses an anti-vaxxer agenda, all the while knowing that she’s influencing people and causing harm. Unwilling to modify or end her cause célèbre even after medical professionals have come out against it. Basically a person without a moral center.",0

(He had claimed tax-exempt status for a college course run for political purposes then lied to investigators to cover his butt.) Admittedly, this was no small achievement. Partisanship notwithstanding, it’s exceedingly tough to get House members to spank one of their own. Still, these days the American public regards pretty much all politicians as ethically shady.

(To be fair, Newt might have stuck with his second wife a bit longer if she had honored his reported entreaties for an open marriage.)

It wasn’t until after the party got its clock cleaned in the 1998 midterms, however, that members finally managed to pry the gavel from Newt’s hands.

Newt Gingrich was its leader.” Having ridden to power on a flood of money, Gingrich had every intention of staying there, noted Lessig. “The four years between 1994 and 1998, Republican candidates and party committees would raise over $1 billion. Never before had a party come anywhere close to raising that amount of money, because never before had any party’s leaders so effectively focused the energy of their members on this single task: fundraising.”",0

Jeffress is a member of Trump’s informal council of evangelical advisors and has backed many of the president’s controversial decisions, including war of words with North Korea. “God has given Trump authority to take out Kim Jong Un,” Jeffress said in August.",0

According to Erickson, the pastor “seems more committed to Trump’s America than Jesus’s eternity.” In an interview, Jeffress responded critically, wondering if Sasse and others would criticize religious leaders who were involved in the American revolution, the abolition of slavery, and the civil-rights movement.",0
1450444118279196672,Sean Hannity is Satan,"Jeffress, who sees himself as Trump’s “most vocal and visible evangelical spokesman,” embodies a distinct school of thought about the way Christians should relate to politics. During his sermon the day Hannity came, Jeffress spoke about Supreme Court decisions that he felt had derailed the country. He encouraged his parishioners to be politically engaged: “How do we push back against evil in the world?” he asked. “One way we do it in our country, a major way we do it, is through the government officials that we elect.”",0
1450444118279196672,Sean Hannity is Satan,"Jeffress peppered in little digs at the left, referring to the “pinhead lawyers from the ACLU and the Freedom from Religion Foundation” and later introducing Hannity as “Rachel Maddow’s worst nightmare.” But he was most focused on what he saw as widespread cultural decay. “We have allowed the atheists, the infidels, the humanists to seize control of this country and pervert our Constitution into something the Founders never intended,” he said. “And we have to say enough to that.”",0
1450444118279196672,Sean Hannity is Satan,"None of this is incidental to Jeffress’s project of teaching people about “a place called heaven”: He believes God calls on Christians to engage in and shape politics.

1450444118279196672,Sean Hannity is Satan,"QUESTION: Welcome to the Sean Hannity Show. Thank you for being with us. Joining us on our newsmaker line is Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice (inaudible). Don't you love it that I drive liberals nuts? SECRETARY RICE: (Laughter.) How are you, Sean? QUESTION: It's always good to talk to you. Are you doing well? SECRETARY RICE: Doing very well, thank you. QUESTION: Well, we always love having you on and we appreciate everything that you're doing. I know it's hard work and difficult. Actually, do you want the harder political question which you hate first or do you want that last? SECRETARY RICE: Why don't we do that last, Sean. Let's get through those hard questions like North Korea and Iran first. QUESTION: You know, it's funny because you always want it last in the hopes of, oops, sorry, we're out of time. SECRETARY RICE: Out of time. Exactly, right. QUESTION: All right, we'll do it the way you want. But anyway, thanks for being with us. Let's talk a little bit about -- there has been a shift in terms of the Administration's position on Iran and Ahmadi-Nejad, and as part of talks that would go on with neighbors in the region in Iraq, we would be willing to sit down with them. Is it a mistake to sit down with a guy that denies the Holocaust, that has chanted death to the U.S., that called just last week, you know, Israel the Satan? SECRETARY RICE: Well, I think we've been very clear about Ahmadi-Nejad and our views that in no case should a respectable nation be involved in that kind of name-calling about another country. And I actually think he's getting blasted not just here in the United States but in his own country for that kind of language. But, Sean, let me just be very clear. The United States is in a position now where I think we send a very strong message to the Iranians through the President's decision to send the carrier strike group into the Gulf, through the fact that we've picked up some of their people who have been engaged in activities to harm our soldiers, and the fact that we've been shutting down the international financial system to them. I think we're in a much stronger position to go to a neighbors meeting. But this is about Iraq. This is not about U.S.-Iran relations. This is about Iraq. QUESTION: All right. I understand that, but I would just think that it was a mistake for the United States knowing -- what can we possibly get in sitting down with a table that denies the Holocaust, that wants to wipe Israel off the map, that has shunned the international community on issues involving nuclear weapons, that chants death to the U.S., that Israel is Satan? Am I wrong in just assuming that that is not somebody we can have a reasonable discussion with? Should we first of all say that if you want to discuss anything with the U.S., you have to first acknowledge the Holocaust occurred? SECRETARY RICE: Well, I think that when you look at what people are saying about Ahmadi-Nejad in his own country, he has clearly made a big mistake in using that kind of language because it has made very clear that he is an international outlaw in that regard. Now, why are we sitting down at the table? First of all, Sean, we have been at the table, so to speak, before in the International Compact for Iraq. But this is a meeting that the Iraqis are calling of their neighbors to get their neighbors to have more responsible policies toward Iraq. If that can succeed, that's a very good thing, but this is not a bilateral discussion between the United States and Iran. QUESTION: All right. Let me ask you this. Do we want regime change in Iran? SECRETARY RICE: We certainly want that regime to change its behavior and we certainly want for the Iranian people the kind of freedoms and democratic future that everybody else in the world -- that everybody in the world should have, absolutely. QUESTION: Well, I mean, it would be -- I think the world will be better off. And I'm just not as hopeful. I just think almost it seems to me fruitless. But look I understand that the idea and -- but you would not put a lot of hope in his willingness to change his rhetoric on the international stage. SECRETARY RICE: No, but you know, Sean, I do think there may be more. I don't think they're moderates in Iran, but I think there may be more reasonable people in Iran who can look at the isolation that they are now -- that they now have, that look at the fact that investment is dropping in Iran, that banks won't deal with Iran, that we have Security Council resolutions against Iran, and perhaps those people will want to change their policies. No, I don't have much hope for Ahmadi-Nejad himself. QUESTION: Yeah. Somebody keeps picking up the line. I don't know if it's on your end or our end. QUESTION: We usually don't have that problem. But let me ask you this, Dick Cheney, for example, said the following about Iraq as we move forward there. And he said the United States wants to finish its mission and return with honor there. He says he -- we know that if we leave Iraq before the mission is completed, the enemy is going to come after us. And I want you to know that the American people will not support a policy of retreat. You want to complete the mission, get it done right, return with honor. QUESTION: Are we going to be able to do that, considering all the political pressure that's going on in Washington? SECRETARY RICE: Oh, I think that the American people want exactly the outcome that the Vice President just outlined and I think the American people also know that leaving an Iraq that is chaotic and might be a safe haven for terrorism is not just bad for Iraq and the Middle East, just very bad for the security of the United States. I believe that Sean, the President made a courageous decision in deciding that we had to reinforce our troops. It wasn't necessarily a popular decision, but presidents are asked throughout history to make the right decision and the President made the right decision. We've got to get out more, talk to the American people about what is happening in Iraq. Yes, it's very, very tough. But we don't have a choice but to succeed there. QUESTION: I agree with you. Now, we now have -- the President has been lauding the surge results or the early results with the increased troops and the fact that they're going there, they're going into these tougher neighborhoods, they're pushing out the insurgency. And they're also staying and holding in those areas. And he's saying that we're seeing early results. Is that what you see? SECRETARY RICE: Yes. I think the way that I would put it is the input so far are very good. The Iraqis are showing up in the numbers that they need to show up. The Maliki government is taking the difficult decisions that it needs to take. I think our forces are working well with the Iraqis. They're coming in. And there's some early signs that the confidence of people of Baghdad is being restored, but it's still early. And Sean, I just want to caution, there are going to be good days and bad days because the enemy is not going to sit still and so we have to be prepared for some bad days, too, but I do think that on balance, so far, things are going reasonably well. QUESTION: Prime Minister Blair is going to be pulling out some of the troops that they have offered in this endeavor. Do you see a time -- are we now turning the corner here in terms of the training of the Iraqi troops and the Iraqi police force, where you think we may be at the end of this in terms of our -- the strength of our commitment to the -- SECRETARY RICE: Well, I do think we're getting there. The Iraqi forces are more capable. They are showing that they're more capable in this latest set of moves and the latest set of actions that they're taking. So yes, I think the day is coming when our commitment will be different, but what we really want to make sure is that we stay focused on the results, that we stay focused on what our troops are doing there. And our troops are helping the Iraqis to secure some breathing space for this young government to get national reconciliation. QUESTION: There's been some criticism in conservative corners about the recent deal with North Korea, saying that we have basically just duplicated the deal that was made in the Clinton years and that there were far too many incentives offered to the North Koreans and that they still can't be trusted. How do you respond? SECRETARY RICE: Well, I would say this isn't a matter of trust. This is a matter of being able to see if they live up to the obligations that they've undertaken. But this is a very different deal than the agreed framework of 1994. Let me just give you one number, for instance. The United States transferred 500,000 metric tons of fuel oil to North Korea every year for eight years. And that was during a time when the North Koreans shut down their reactor. The North Koreans will shut down their reactor here in about a month. And for that, they will get 50,000 tons of fuel oil from South Korea, period. The next phase will be for them to disable their nuclear facilities and then to go on to completely dismantle their program. So we're at the first stage. Sean, you know I'm a football fan. I always say we're in the first quarter of this and we will see how this goes out. But this is a very different deal and perhaps most importantly, this is an agreement with not just the United States, but also with China, Japan, South Korea, and Russia. And if the North Koreans break this deal this time, they will have no supporters anywhere in the world. QUESTION: You're confident that this is a full trust-and-verify deal, that we will verify it before they're given the gains and rewards, also part of the new framework? SECRETARY RICE: Well, this -- we will be able to tell what they're doing because shutting down a reactor, disabling; those are elements that we can verify. QUESTION: Yeah. Let me ask about the comments of Russian President Putin attacking the U.S. recently, suggesting that the U.S. was trying to dominate the world through the use of force. Your reaction? SECRETARY RICE: Well, it's just not the world that we see and actually, we've had some good cooperation with the Russians in some places, we've had some disagreements in others. But I really like the comments of Defense Secretary Gates; you know, one Cold War was enough, we don't need to do that again. QUESTION: All right. Now are you ready for the real easy questions? QUESTION: All right. But first, let's say it's the summer of '08 and it's just before the Republican nomination -- the Republic convention. And let's say it's either Rudy Giuliani or Mitt Romney or one of the other candidates, they're going to be running for president for the Republicans. And you get a phone call from one of them and they say, ""Madame Secretary, I would like you to join the ticket and be the next Vice President of the United States."" SECRETARY RICE: Well, Sean, you know -- QUESTION: Am I going to get in trouble for asking this? SECRETARY RICE: I should have taken these questions first. (Laughter.) Sean, you know that I don't have any desire to run for office on either end of the ticket. And we're going to have really good candidates. I know that. We're going to have really good vice presidential candidates as well. But I'm going to go back to Stanford, hopefully by way of the Beijing Olympics. QUESTION: Oh, you're going to the Olympics? SECRETARY RICE: I'd love to go to the Olympics, sure. QUESTION: Oh, that would be fun. But would you -- will you rule it out 100 percent that there's no way you wouldn't even consider it -- I mean, considering what an honor it would be? SECRETARY RICE: Well, it would certainly be an honor, but I just don't see it for me. SECRETARY RICE: I just don't see it. QUESTION: You're really good. Remind me not to negotiate with you. (Laughter.) All right, let me ask this. I watched you very closely in an interview that you did recently with my buddy Chris Wallace over at Fox on Sunday. And he was pointing out to you, for example, you know, 94 percent of Americans would vote for their party's African American nominee and he was asking you, for example, about Senator Barack Obama. But there's one thing that you said in this interview here and that you said if you serve your full term, which we anticipate you will, you will have had an African American in the position of Secretary of State for 12 consecutive years. SECRETARY RICE: No, I said there would not have been white male, because you had -- SECRETARY RICE: Right. Madeleine Albright for four, then Colin Powell and -- SECRETARY RICE: -- and then me. So African American, eight years and a woman and then two African Americans. QUESTION: What does that mean? Because at the end of it you said race is still a factor in the country but -- and you said people still see race. QUESTION: Do you think to that extent, even though 94 percent in this poll are saying that they don't see it? SECRETARY RICE: Well, I think what's happened, Sean, and it really speaks well for America, I think it's still the fact that when somebody walks in the room you see that they're black. It doesn't -- it's not the last thing that you see. It may even be the first thing that you see. QUESTION: When I walk in a room, people say that I -- look, he's gained more weight. (Laughter.) SECRETARY RICE: That's right. But, you know, the good thing about it is that I don't think it any longer really translates for people into a sense of whether or not that person is competent. I don't think it says anything more about what role that person ought to play. So even though race is still a factor, I do believe that as a country we've begun to get to the place that we don't impute to a particular race any particular characteristics, and that's a good thing. QUESTION: Do you have any thoughts? Do you know Senator Barack Obama? SECRETARY RICE: I do. I think he is a very attractive person. I think he's very smart. And you know, I think he will do very well. But I think ultimately people will make their decisions based on whether or not they share -- any candidate shares your value, whether you think any candidate is going to represent your interests. I still think that's how Americans will choose their president. QUESTION: Well, I'm still thinking that you're going to get the job as the commissioner of the NFL. That's, I know, your dream job. It will come open again and you'll spend a year or two -- first of all, you'll spend four years as Vice President and you'll do a great job. SECRETARY RICE: Thanks, but no thanks, Sean. (Laughter.) QUESTION: Yeah, I know, what a great friend I am, huh? QUESTION: Well, anyway, I do think you'd be a terrific Vice President if you ever wanted the job. And I know if you ever expressed any willingness that I know every one of these candidates would -- you'd be right there, number one or two on their list. SECRETARY RICE: Well, I appreciate that. But I tell you, I'm looking forward to trying to help the President cement the democracy agenda here, to do what we can to make certain that we've laid a good foundation in this generational struggle against terrorism, and help the people of these young democracies in places like Iraq and Afghanistan and Lebanon lay a really good and strong foundation. I think that will be enough work for now. QUESTION: I think that's something that you certainly will be proud of in the legacy. Let me ask you this question: Does it bother you as much as it bothers me, to the extent to which war has become politicized, how so many people seemingly have forgotten the attack on 9/11, the names that are called the President on a regular basis? You read the papers, you follow the news every day, you know how vicious these attacks have been and continue to be. Does that get to you? Does that bother you? Does that impact you in any way? SECRETARY RICE: Well, I think you have to realize that it comes a bit with the territory. But certainly, sure, I do not like it when people call -- not just call the President names but somehow try to assert that he's been untruthful with the American people or -- it's just not true. And this President has made more really difficult decisions than any president in modern memory and he's done it because it was on our watch. It was our fortune to be here when the country was attacked in the way that it was on September 11th. And it is easy to forget the horror of that. It's easy to forget that there's still terrorists out there who would love to do it again. It's hard to realize what it's like to be in government when you realize that the odds are this: They have to be right one time; you have to be right 100 percent of the time. And that set of responsibilities and preparing the country for war and executing war is one of the most difficult things that any commander-in-chief can do, and this President has done it very, very well. And yes, sure, I wish there were more recognition of that. QUESTION: Madame Secretary, we always love having you on. Thank you for being with us and we'll talk soon. And we'll be talking football next time. SECRETARY RICE: I look forward to it, Sean. Take care.",0

3. The Department of Justice could certainly send US attorneys to polling places. I don’t know if there are enough of them to cover every precinct, even with the smaller number of polling sites due to the pandemic.
I myself may choose to go to an early voting site this year, something I have never done before. It depends on what the state of things in my county is like come November.

1450435009488343049,The being formerly known as Kanye west is a fucking moron,"“Dave used to play this game called the Punching Game,” he continues. “We all took it in turns to punch each other. I remember playing it with the bass player from Dinosaur Jr … he was fucking massive. Taller than me. He lumped the shit out of everyone.” Rowntree remembers the game, too. “It wasn’t playful, it really hurt,” he says. “We’d sit on chairs in a big circle and everyone would punch the person to their left as hard as they liked in the head, and it would go on round. Generally it wasn’t too bad. You rarely fell off your chair from being punched in the head too hard, mainly because we were always too drunk.” The game emerged during a gruelling American tour in 1992, when the band were forced to play their Anglocentric songs in tiny venues to bewildered crowds while they tried to pay back debts racked up by their previous manager. Coxon remembers the culture shock: “We ended up being chased out of one radio station by people with shotguns,” he says. “Just because we cussed on air.”",0

Go for it, Dara.","The pattern in these graphs reflects the broader historical trend in rap music: profanity didn’t take off until the 1990s, but has remained relatively constant since then. Much of the early uptick in profanity can probably be attributed to rap music on the West Coast. Artists like NWA and Too Short were ahead of the curve when it came to profanity. Artists on the East Coast picked up on this trend a little later, increasing quite a bit in the early 1990s.",0

Much of the shift can be attributed to the increasing dominance of gangster and criminal culture in rap music in the early 1990s. Prior to that, rap artists represented a broader, more mainstream culture (albeit from a black perspective). After NWA, a lot of record labels found they could make more money with an exploitation formula, centered around “street” culture.",0

The Microsoft co-founder dropped out of college at age 19 because he believed a computer should be on every desk and in every home. You only put a lot of money and time into something when when you have relentless confidence in your abilities. But there was another side of Gates — quite the opposite of his unshakable confidence. From the day he started Microsoft, he insisted on always having enough cash in the bank to keep the company alive for 12 months with no revenue coming in. As a result, Gates erred on the side of caution. ""I always had to be careful that we wouldn't hire too many people,"" he said in a 2017 interview on ""The Ellen DeGeneres Show.""

1449111091670392835,@that_gai_gai i hate bill gates so much. there are no words. LINUX.,"British mathematician John Littlewood created the Law of Miracles, which states that in the course of any person's life, miracles happen at a rate of roughly one per month. ""During the time that we are awake and engaged in living our lives, roughly for eight hours each day, we see and hear things happening at a rate of one per second,"" physicist Freeman Dyson explains. ""So the total number of events that happen to us is about 30,000 per day, or about one million per month."" He continues: ""With few exceptions, these events are not miracles because they are insignificant. The chance of a miracle is about one per million events. Therefore, we should expect about one miracle to happen, on average, every month."" The idea that incredible things happen because of boring, obvious statistics is important, because it's true for terrible things, too. Think about 100-year events: 100-year floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, financial crises, frauds, pandemics, political meltdowns, economic recessions, and so on. Anything can be called a ""100-year event."" But a 100-year event doesn't mean it happens every 100 years. It means there's about a 1% chance of it occurring in any given year. That seems low. But when there are hundreds of independent 100-year events, what are the odds that any one of them will occur in a given year? If there's a 1% chance of a new disastrous pandemic, a 1% chance of a crippling depression, a 1% chance of a catastrophic flood, and a 1% chance of political collapse, then the odds that something bad will happen this year — or any year — are uncomfortably high. Littlewood's Law tells us to expect a miracle every month. The flip side is to expect a disaster roughly as often. Which is what history tells us, isn't it? The world breaks about once every 10 years, on average. For your country, state, town or business, once every one to three years is probably more common. Sometimes it feels like terrible luck, or that bad news has new momentum. More often, it's just Littlewood's Law at work. A billion different things can go wrong, so at least one of them is likely to be causing havoc in any given moment. Saving like a pessimist means you acknowledge the cold statistics of how common bad news is. It's common at a global, national, local, business and personal level. So save money heavily, knowing with certainty that you'll need a cushion to deal with the next banana peel. Be a little paranoid, knowing that the assumptions you hold today could break tomorrow, and you'll need enough room for error to make it to the next round.",0

The first version of the standard pack installation of Win95, for example, did not include either a web browser or the TCP/IP stack required to connect a PC to the net.

We later found out that in May 1995 Bill Gates, then the CEO, had had his “Oh shit!” moment about the internet. On 26 May he sent out a famous long memo to all executive staff in the company. It was headed “The Internet Tidal Wave” and in it Gates made it abundantly clear that the company had to pivot immediately to address the existential threat the network represented.",0

LINUX.,"“One scary possibility being discussed by internet fans,” he wrote, “is whether they should get together and create something far less expensive than a PC which is powerful enough for web browsing.” Given that Microsoft’s monopoly was built on the PC, this would be a really big deal. He pointed out that after 10 hours of browsing the internet, he “had not seen a single Word.doc, AVI file, Windows.exe (other than content viewers), or other Microsoft file format”. He did, however, see “a great number of QuickTime files” and declared his determination to “match or beat” the services offered by Netscape, a “competitor ‘born’ on the internet” which at the time was claiming to have a 70% share of the web-browser market.",0

Gates and co set out to destroy Netscape before it could mature into the existential threat he had foreseen. And the campaign succeeded; Netscape was destroyed – though before it died it open-sourced its Netscape browser code, thereby enabling the founding of Mozilla, the free software community that now produces Firefox. Microsoft’s Internet Explorer became the dominant web browser – mainly because every copy of Windows came with it installed by default.",0

LINUX.,"So although Gates’s consummate ruthlessness in eliminating Netscape succeeded, it also nearly destroyed Microsoft. In 1998, the US Department of Justice sued it for illegally thwarting competition and for compelling computer makers to include its internet browser when installing Windows. The initial judgment in the case – that Microsoft should be broken up – was overturned on appeal and in 2001 the George W Bush administration sought a lesser antitrust penalty and agreed a deal with the company.

They show a mogul who is incredulous that the government would dare to obstruct his route to world domination. The tapes confirm how obnoxious and aggressive Gates was at that point in his life (he was 43). And the question they prompt is this: how did this sullen and dismissive businessman morph into the generous, enlightened, public-spirited philanthropist we see today? If such a transformation can happen to the Bill Gates of old, then surely it can happen to anyone. Well, almost anyone: in the week of the Republican convention, one shouldn’t get carried away.",0

1448982208438579207,Demi Lovato is a fucking moron,"First off, without Katy Perry tweeting out about it, no one would have known ‘Bad Blood' was about Katy Perry. Taylor has never talked about their feud. Katy is the one who talks about it. I have to wonder, did Katy Perry ever inform Taylor that the clause the backup dancers put in their contracts was put there so they could leave and go on tour with Katy? If not, Taylor's people may have never hired them in the first place, investing time into people who weren't loyal. Taylor values loyalty. It's petty, but Katy drew attention to it. The only time hints about the feud were given was in the ‘Look What You Made Me Do' video, which was after a long time of Katy Perry shading Taylor and alluding to her in ‘Swish Swish'. There were no allusions in ‘Bad Blood'. It was a petty fight. We've all done petty things before. Diss tracks are nothing new. Unless you are trying to say that Taylor Swift invented diss tracks? Which, is false. When asked about it once, Ed Sheeran says he also writes diss tracks. He says just no one is as obsessed to pry into his life and track down people, so they don't get references. Besides, I think Katy Perry and Taylor Swift have buried the hatchet. Also, I'll talk about the exes thing. Taylor wrote about bad exes because they were bad boyfriends. Joe Jonas broke up with her on the phone (they are friends now, but it was very devastating at the time). Her song written about Taylor Lautner was an apology to him. John Mayer is an egotistical asshole. Even his fans agree. That is why people have compiled entire lists of his douchbag quotes. Jake Gyllenhaal was scared of commitment. They fell in love very quick, and it scared him. She never dissed Harry Styles, just wrote some songs about him. Everyone writes about their exes. Beyonce has a whole album trashing Jay-Z. Calvin's tweet wasn't because Taylor got together with Tom. It was because Taylor's management revealed she was the one who wrote Calvin's hit song he did for Rihanna, ‘This is What You Came For'. He felt that people knowing she wrote it made people not value his work as a DJ. He said he regretted the tweeting spree later on. Now, I'll talk about your hypocritical feminism point. Everyone has been a hypocrite in their lives. For most, it is multiple times. I'll give an example of a hypocritical feminist you seem to enjoy: Demi Lovato. Taylor donated $250,000 to Kesha during her trial to help with legal fees. After Kesha's mom posted about it, Taylor's team released a statement saying it was true. Demi then went on a rant about how Taylor Swift should “Take something to Capitol Hill or actually speak out about something and then I'll be impressed”. She also cited that not everyone has $250,000 to just give away (If it is true for her, she must manage her money poorly. Since, Demi Lovato is a very successful actress and singer). I could be annoyed at her drawing the attention away from Kesha following the loss of her trial, but it would be fine if it was only that. Later on, Taylor Swift was involved in a sexual assault trial of her own. A radio host who had groped her at a meet and greet in 2013 was trying to sue her for 3 million dollars in damages. He filed the lawsuit in 2015, saying he got fired due to it and citing Taylor Swift as the reason. The litigation eventually led to a trial in 2017. Sonce he was suing her, she countersued for just $1 (the lowest you can) to prove a point that sexual assault is NOT okay. After powerful, grueling testimony from Swift, her mother, a bodyguard, a photographer, and a damning photo, the judge dismissed this radio hosts claims, and a jury found him guilty of the assault. You may wonder why I am providing you with this information. The reason is, although Demi was outspoken when Kesha's trial took place, she said NOTHING about the Taylor Swift trial. Taylor's trial was groundbreaking. Rape and assault hotlines recieved massive spikes in calls. Taylor's testimony is being used as an example for other victims during their trial. Little miss feminist Demi, all about speaking out for other women and against sexual assault, said nothing in support of Swift. Demi is a hypocritical feminist. I like her voice and her music, but I lost respect for her after she claimed to advocate against sexual assault, but couldn't bring herself to tweet in support of Swift. She isn't even the only one, either. People are so into blanket dislike that they couldn't even bring themselves to realize that in this case, Swift was just like every other sexual assault victim.",0

At 130 pounds she’s wouldn’t be thick because she actually has some muscle so she can carry weight well up to a certain point.,1

I’m scaredFace with open mouth and cold sweat,"A few days ago I was playing dentist with my 4-year-old niece Avie and her doll Lola — a rigid rubbery thing with a locked jaw from which protruded two small front teeth. As Lola’s mother, Avie insisted that I give Lola a thorough exam. Dutifully, I complied, pretending to examine the doll’s mouth. Avie brought her face close, and her milk chocolate-colored eyes gazed kindly into mine. “Actually,” she explained in a gentle whisper, “She’s just a doll.” Then, reverting to our game of pretend, she instructed me to switch from dentist to doctor and diagnose Lola’s stomach ache. That careening between make-believe and the real world has been on my mind as I try to get inside the heads of the 20% of Americans who think that COVID-19 outbreak was probably planned by a small group of powerful people, and the additional 5% who believe it definitely was. To be clear: that's 1 in 4 Americans, who, in embracing that narrative, effectively reject science. That’s not just an intellectual failing; it is a form of ideological zealotry that has cost tens of thousands of lives. And it’s just one of the more benign manifestations of a new meld of paranoia and religious zeal that could fuel the reelection of Donald Trump.",0
1448483989321183237,@RepustarRobyn @FactSparrow I heard Ivermectin prevents covid-19 and Bill Gates is a satanic pedophile woh is putting microchips in the vaccines. I’m scaredFace with open mouth and cold sweat,"There are many variations on the theory that COVID-19 was a master stroke. The virus was co-created by Anthony Fauci and Barak Obama (as agents of the Deep State), or the pandemic is a product of a covert intelligence operation designed to distract the world from bringing a Satanic cabal to justice. Or Bill Gates is behind the current crisis, using the pandemic as a cover for pushing a vaccine containing a tracking device that will keep tabs on everyone on the planet (44% of Republicans subscribed to that premise in a recent poll and its proponents maintain was foretold in the Book of Revelations). But if not Bill Gates, then the Chinese government is responsible, having created COVID-19 as a population control bioweapon. No, wait — it was actually “purposely created and released so that central bankers, investment bankers, corporate heads, and government puppets could use it as cover for an imminent economic collapse.” Either that or the pandemic has been overblown in order to create a financial crisis to ensure the defeat of Donald Trump. And these conspiracy theories are just the tip of this iceberg of self-delusion. The QAnon movement — a loose network of extreme right-wingers with an apocalyptic bent — looks deeper than COVID-19, into what gave rise to Donald Trump’s election. Their conclusion? With or without divine intervention (but probably with it), Trump was elected to put an end to the worldwide cabal of Satan-worshiping pedophiles that rule the government, the media and Hollywood. Some QAnon beliefs (such as that Oprah Winfrey and Tom Hanks have been arrested for running child sex rings) are grotesquely sensational. Others are more pointedly and strategically partisan (like that Adam Schiff’s sister is married to the son of villainous puppet master, George Soros, despite the fact that Adam Schiff doesn’t have a sister). Many suggest that Trump either is himself the anonymous “Q” or that he endorses QAnon’s theories. Indeed, as Peter Beinert notes, “Trump himself has suggested that Antonin Scalia might have been murdered, climate change is a Chinese hoax, Ted Cruz’s father was involved in John F. Kennedy’s assassination, the Clintons may bear responsibility for the murder of Jeffrey Epstein, and wind turbines cause cancer.” And after all, Trump wore a tie to a coronavirus briefing that was yellow — the color of the maritime flag representing the letter Q (for “quarantine”) and indicating that there are no infected people aboard ship. What better way to signal that the pandemic isn’t real? A man wear a shirt with the words Q Anon as he attends a rally for President Donald Trump at the Make America Great Again Rally being held in the Florida State Fair Grounds Expo Hall on July 31, 2018 in Tampa, Florida. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images) These malevolent fairy tales are not shared just by a handful of kooks on the fringes of society. The winner of Georgia’s Congressional GOP primary runoff, Marjorie Taylor Green, was apparently more helped than hindered by her anti-Semitic, Islamophobic comments and endorsement of “Q.” And she is just one of 14 Republican candidates on the ballot in November or competing in primary runoffs, who tweet QAnon’s “secret” acronyms and endorse its theories. Not only are these beliefs vile, but they are precisely the kind of distraction that Trump and his cronies welcome. Notably absent from any of the QAnon theories is any fact-based analysis of capitalism — of who makes the money and the rules, or of how. Were they curious about the real ways that the deck is stacked against them, this group of conspiracy theorists would discover surprising agreement with those at the other end of the political spectrum. But what QAnon followers and COVID-deniers believe is ultimately less important than why. “[QAnon] harnesses paranoia to fervent hope and a deep sense of belonging …” writes Adrienne LaFrance in a thoughtful Atlantic article. “[It] offers a polemic to empower those who feel adrift.” Physically and politically Balkanized, Americans’ sense of community has been steadily eroding. And even before the pandemic, Americans were feeling increasingly powerless, for good reason. Income inequality and the disparities in political power that reflect it, have left policy-making largely in the hands of large business interests, with little or no meaningful influence exercised by average citizens or mass-based interest groups.",0

I’m scaredFace with open mouth and cold sweat,"One antidote to feeling personally impotent is to attribute absolute power to sinister forces. One cure for loneliness and alienation is to feel that you are a part of today-victimized, tomorrow-triumphant group that possesses secret knowledge. For some followers, QAnon may be little more than an ever-evolving fantasy game. But even games of make-believe carry risks. The cult is getting large and dangerous enough that in an internal memo last year, the FBI classified QAnon as a domestic terrorism threat. While children are generally able to distinguish between pretense and reality, those unable to regulate their negative emotions like fear and anger (which sadly, are chronic emotional states for Americans across the political spectrum) seem to be more easily confused about what is real versus what is fantasy. When we play with children, we jointly enter into a conspiracy to temporarily suspend disbelief, to pretend while at the same time acknowledging that we’re doing so. But what the COVID-19 hoax proponents and QAnon followers do is the opposite; they suspend disbelief in order to embrace a conspiracy. Unlike 4-year-old Avie, they struggle to differentiate between what is fun and what is fact, what is play and what is truth. And unlike Avie’s doll Lola, their delusions have real teeth that bite.",0

Devoted QAnon followers believe — to varying levels of detail — that there is a secret cabal of powerful elites who run an underground pedophilia ring, and that President Trump is currently working to bring these evildoers to justice. If you go all the way down the rabbit hole you’ll find theories about Bill Gates injecting tracking devices into every citizen, blood libel, devil worship and draining kids of a chemical compound called adrenochrome to become immortal.

The hashtag had been used before (notably to promote the charity Save The Children, which has been around for a century and is unaffiliated with QAnon), but in July and August, the number of posts using it surged, and a major portion of those posts were Q-affiliated. This was likely due in part to the pandemic, Rothschild said: With more people stuck indoors, out of work and feeling hopeless, it’s easy to get sucked into an online world that claims to have all the answers. But it also coincided with a crackdown from Twitter to remove Q-related content. Suddenly, Q followers couldn’t spread their message as openly as they had before, so it’s possible that’s why they adopted a hashtag that was so wholesome, social media sites couldn’t possibly ban it.

Supposedly, QAnon started with one or more people who had access to very high-level state secrets claiming that there was a cabal in the “Deep State” associated with Hillary Clinton and other high-profile Democrats or liberals to unseat President Trump. In other words, the makings of a coup. The “Anon” part of the username which first posted these claims online refers to him/her being anonymous. The “Q” part stands for a Q-level security clearance . . . which is equal to Top Secret. Sounds pretty impressive, even James Bondish, no? Well, let’s look at some very easy-to-spot problems:",0

I’m scaredFace with open mouth and cold sweat,"I write about Russian military affairs with an emphasis on aviation and also have written about military and civil applications for nuclear power, including a blog on nuclear/Cold War history. A Q Clearance is given by the US Department of Energy and normally is given to scientists and others working on nuclear weapons technology. Yes, the DOE has a security branch which manages the stewardship of actual nuclear weapons, as well, and they could also hold Q clearances. However, it’s used in the DOE and most—even very high-level, like SES folks—DOE staff will not be working on issues where they would ever encounter the type supposed Deep State doings reported by QAnon, were those real. QAnon’s claims sound like something that, if true, might be unearthed by the FBI, CIA, or some parts of the DOD. None of those people normally have Q clearances. No one in even the security arms of the DOE however would be looking at intel about a Deep State cabal preparing a coup in detail, because that sort of business would, if done on US soil, be the FBI and maybe Secret Service’s area of operations—it would be counter-terrorism.",0

I’m scaredFace with open mouth and cold sweat,"Secondly, the claims QAnon posits are equally B-movie grade of action/adventure spy narrative at best. Supposedly, a high-level but untrusted female in the government long has been plotting a coup—so of course, Hillary springs to mind. But would she? I mean, if the FBI or anyone was seriously investigating these things? Would Hillary who has no formal govt office now be the first suspect? Could she and her minions really pull the strings as QAnon claims? I would think before suspecting her, more likely suspects would have to be ruled out, people like Betty J. Sapp and several SES officials (I am NOT saying Sapp was plotting anything either, at all, but just saying when she was still in office she would be a better suspect for someone who in theory could plot a massive Deep State coup). But a lot of you reading this probably don’t know who Sapp is, and had to look her up, right? Let’s be honest. In contrast, all the players QAnon named or alluded to were people who are household names, because they have to be. If they’re obscure SES people no one would care. And that’s big, because the entire worth of QAnon’s amazing, patently unrealistic and assuredly false claims about a coup and such is that it is a motivating factor to the far right. It’s like Sarah Palin giving a speech: it’s worth is not in the facts contained but her fiery and sure delivery. The names and claims have to be big, the logic can be fully absent, needs to read like a second-rate spy novel, not reality. And QAnon did and a lot of people seem to have believed it.",0

Q followers try to figure out the breadcrumbs and put them together in a process they call “making bread.” The “drops” appear on an internet message board called 8kun (formerly 8chan). Certain phrases are associated with the group like “where we go one, we go all” (WWG1WGA) and “follow the plan.”",0

I’m scaredFace with open mouth and cold sweat,"QAnon beliefs spill over into the real world, most notably the storming of the U. S. Capitol on January 6. The guy in the animal skin was Jacob Anthony Chansley (aka Jake Angeli), the self-proclaimed “QAnon Shaman.” Some have likened QAnon to a LARP (live action role-playing game) but it is far more serious and dangerous than a game. It is racist, violent and anti-Semitic.",0

If you know anything at all about real science, and if you know anything at all about the human brain, and how the human mind actually works (or often doesn’t) you know that if you look past your nose and beneath the surface of things, and actually have some real knowledge about the subject in question, 99.9% of conspiracy theories completely fall apart.",0

I’m scaredFace with open mouth and cold sweat,"Conspiracy theories only work in the presence of incredible, vast, breathtaking, “only knowing enough to be extremely dangerous” ignorance. Conspiracy theorists aren’t even beginning to suspect what the true definition of the word theory really is. They don’t have a clue. They “think” any tomfool thing you just make up-and you “think” sounds pretty snappy- is a “theory”. If you then find some factoid taken out of context that “seems” to confirm your preconceived, goofball agenda (and of course, ignore any and all evidence to the contrary, which you “think” is just a hoax, a conspiracy, or fake news), you now have “proof” you are “right”.",0

Trump and the people he surrounds himself with all suffer mightily from the Dunning-Krueger Effect. They are vastly ignorant of the vastness of their own ignorance, and they never, ever get -or listen to -the advice of experts (because they “think” they know better than the experts do). They don’t care a whit about actual knowledge nor expertise on the part of their staffers, all they are interested in is unquestioning loyalty- or they are GONE.",0
