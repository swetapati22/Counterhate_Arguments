1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,2.) Smarts,0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"* Spidey - is a nerd. Apparently being bitten by a radioactive spider doesn’t help you in that regard, but being a nerd sure did help writers cover the fact Parker doesn’t spin webs out of his butt. He makes his own web shooters, among other things, and has had his intellect praised by both Pym and Richards. His knowledge of engineering and chemistry aid him in battle. Currently, he has more up his sleeve as the Web-slinger, and even runs his own company competing with Stark Enterprises, and winning.
 * DD - has a law degree.
Winner: Spidey. You could argue DD is more strategic, but who’s to say Spidey isn’t as well?",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,3.) Skill,0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"* Spidey - After being bitten by a radioactive spider, Spidey gained the proportionate speed of a spider, a spider’s balance, and acrobatic skill. Because really, spiders are miniature trapeze artists. Beyond the boon, Spider-man started out with no fighting training whatsoever. He later went to Shang-Chi for training and developed his own fighting style. That’s all I know. He also has journalistic and photography skill, and significant grifting/con-artistry being able to keep his employment in the Daily Bugle by sending his selfies.
 * DD - is blind. But he has learned from ninjas,and from one in particular who identifies because of being similarly “differently-abled”. So yeah. He has fought Iron Fist, Black Panther, Shang-Chi, Wolverine, and Karnak all to standstills, is proficient in chi-control, a vast array of weaponry, and has extensive knowledge in pressure points. His acute sense of balance allows him to have the acrobatic skill of an Olympic-level gymnast.
Winner: DD. He has more skill in martial arts, and generally better training.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,4.) Extrasensory Ability,0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"* Spidey - has spider-sense, which allows him to be made aware of imminent danger.
 * DD - has acute senses of smell, hearing, taste, touch, and balance. He also has Radar Sense, in which he uses some form of echolocation (minus the screeching). He, however, is blind, and has difficulty perceiving colors and images, but is generally immune to illusions.
Winner: DD. This was close, but DD’s senses have more utility. In a fight between them, however, Spider-man would detect every time DD is nearby (unless the Chaste has a workaround I don’t know about, or if there are scans of ninja types bypassing Spider-sense)",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,5.) Kit,0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"* Spidey - he has always had much utility with his webbing and adhesive fingers and toes, but also has quite an array of different situational costumes on par with Iron-man in terms of coverage. Recently, Parker Industries has enhanced webtech, introducing a variety of different web options that prove excellent weapons in battle. This includes Rapid-fire Web Bullets (which has always been done before) as concussive projectiles, Foam webs (as shown in International Spider-man), Taser Webs (both comic and Homecoming), Web Grenades (Homecoming) among other things. Spidey also has his own plane to solve his non-urban travel problems, tracers, drones, and etc.
 * DD - has sticks. But you know, they’re customized. You can like, throw ’em at people and hit people with it. And it doubles as a white cane.
Winner: Spider-man. With that kit, DD won’t see it coming.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Personally, I could argue situations wherein Matt could win, but it’s all conjecture. But at the end of it all, it’s up to the writers. (And since the writers and the audience absolutely love Spidey, well, then bully for you, Matt.)",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"From what I know of Lara Croft, she's an archaeologist with many additional skills. Many of these skills are not cheap, but I'm sure that if you're serious about this, cost is really no problem. Plus you can learn some of these things online.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"In order to be like Lara Croft, I would suggest doing the following:",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"1. Take an interest in Archaeology and World History (Lara always seems to know about various legends all over the world). Maybe a bit of anthropology as well.
2. Since I'm reasonably sure that you're not a rich British aristocrat, and therefore unable to travel the world, I would suggest taking up metal detecting for a start. You won't be finding amazing treasures every day, but it may still be a fun experience. And you may be able to fund further training with any money you make from your endeavor. And of course, you can keep many of your treasures in your “Room of Antiquities” and brag about how “I found this Revolutionary Officer's Pistol while on a dig in (insert location here).”
3. Physical fitness and Parkour. Lara’s no heavyweight. Her diet and workout regimen see to that.
4. Wilderness survival tactics (all terrain). Lara can survive anywhere because she has the training and experience to pull it off. This includes making a bow and hunting her own food.
5. Archery. Because HAVING a bow is one thing. Knowing how to use it is a whole other story.
6. Horseback riding.
7. Vehicle training; cars, motorcycles, trucks, planes and boats.
8. Navigation skills, with or without compass and/or GPS.
9. Combat training in a variety of practical styles.
10. Firearms training and proficiency with as many weapons as possible.
11. Escape and Evasion training. Lara is no stranger to being captured.
12. Rock climbing.
13. Spelunking (look it up).
14. Diving.
15. Parachuting.
16. Financial Literacy and Investment skills. Lara may have inherited her wealth, but she keeps herself out of the poorhouse because she knows how to spend her money wisely and effectively.
17. Socializing and Etiquette for High Society. Lara’s no stranger to mingling with the wealthy elite of the world. In fact, it is sometimes necessary for her to do so in order to attain her goals.
18. Good fashion sense. Lara is always well dressed.
19. Diplomacy. A diplomatic approach is often far more effective than a violent one.
20. First Aid and Field Medic skills, using either the first aid kit or medicinal plants from the environment itself (this is where wilderness training comes into play).
21. Tracking skills, whether animal or human.
22. Fluency in multiple languages FOR SURE.
23. The ability to gain trustworthy allies. In the games, Croft is always alone as she faces danger. In real life, you will need allies to depend upon if you're injured, lost, fighting for your life, kidnapped, etc. Or you just might need a ship's captain or someone to run your gear. Friends can help with that.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"That's a tough question. Both are known for pushing through extreme circumstances with all odds against them. Both have gone against some really strong, crazy, and deadly foes and have emerged victorious. They are both really intelligent and able to adapt to any given circumstance.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"I love both Lara Croft (especially in the most recent games) and Nathan Drake. Lara has been shanked in the side, fallen from large heights, been chased by a crazy guy and yet was able to escape and survive, and return with a vengeance. Nathan survived a bullet wound to the stomach area, climbed up and out of a train hanging over a cliff, fought off a large mob of enemies, and then somehow survived freezing cold temperatures. He then finished off a madman who had become somewhat superhuman.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,Honestly...I don't see a clear winner. They are both tough as nails and don't back down. I can't decide which one I would want to win either. Can you imagine what it would be like if they teamed up?  Now that would be pretty awesome.,0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Angelina Jolie as Croft follows this trend. She has the features and the physical build for the role, as well as the acting chops to pull off a suave-and-sexy British accent.",1
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"She was excellent. HBC took what she was given and ran with it. Her portrayal of Bellatrix as a madwoman delighting in the horrors she indulged in left me with no complaints - not about her, anyway.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"The problem, for me, is that these movies were trapped in their PG-13 rating. It makes sense that they would want younger audiences to be able to watch the final installments in Harry’s journey, but thematically it was a mistake.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"More and more often, the films tell us that characters are deadly or unhinged more than we actually see it, just because we can’t have Voldemort and Bellatrix and Greyback behaving in the movies as they do in the books. The films would be entirely inappropriate for children if they had included such material.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"When Harry Potter is remade in the future, I have my fingers crossed for a Game of Thrones-style television series, one whose network doesn’t have such restrictions. With the freedom to age the characters and themes as necessary, the closing chapters of Harry’s story might have the same weight as they did in the books.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"The Death Eaters had to be evil to be truly believable, and although they’ve had horrific events in their pasts, none of them - including Voldemort - ever came close to their reputations in the behavior we witnessed from them. They couldn’t inspire the fear and hatred they were supposed to, because they weren’t allowed to. And this is what needs to change in the future.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Overall yes. She was best when she didn’t have as much dialogue, such as her sneering and laughing. Just like the other villains she was quite watered down. In the books she was a feared character, in the films she seemed almost fun to watch at times.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"I also think Carter went a little overboard with the “crazy” aspect. Bellatrix was unhinged but she was not bonkers; the books had her much more focused, sadistic, and rash. A prime example is the Unbreakable Vow scene…Bellatrix would barely compose herself in the books in Snape’s presence, but in the films she was rather composed and almost funny. I also thought it was horrible how Harry had her at her mercy in OotP after she killed her cousin when in the books it was clear she was out of his league. A similar thing is seen with Sirius, as he is much more mature and composed compared to his more aggressive book counterpart.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"I love both the actress and the character, and find that Helena acted marvelously the complex and twisted character Bellatrix is. Madness (The Deathly Hallows part 1), childish behavior (Order of the Phenix), fanatism and submission to Voldemort (Half-Blood Prince/DH part )… for me Helena perfectly pictured the complex and Incredible character that Bellatrix is. She has that incredible skill to be able to act complicate/crazy/mad/incredible characters (widely demonstrated while working with Tim Burton), and is the perfect Bellatrix for me.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"She was absolutely PERFECT as Bellatrix Lestrange. I still think that Elizabeth Hurley would have made a good Bellatrix as well lookswise, but I think that HBC was excellent at capturing the essence of the psychotic Bellatrix Lestrange.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"No, absolutely not. I think she would have perhaps been better as one of the teachers at Hogwarts. I haven't seen the movies until I had the books read (which was only in 2021), so I was pretty shocked and extremely disappointed that Helena was Bellatrix. As I was reading the books, the image of Bellatrix that formed in my mind was that of someone once very beautiful, sad, evil, disturbed but not deranged, and haughty. Helena doesn't really fit any of these; I mean she is attractive but not exactly beautiful; and she always overdoes it with the crazy factor, which is fine for most movies but not Harry Potter; also, she didn't really strike me as evil, just mad; there was no coldness emanating from her. As much as it pains me to admit it, I think Angelina Jolie would have been great as Bellatrix, but I've read somewhere that JK Rowling insisted on British actors.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"In the films, it’s likely they gave Bellatrix bad teeth in order to better portray the “evil is ugly” trope, which is a bit ironic considering they hired Helena Bonham Carter to portray her, an actress whom many people find quite alluring.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"That said, in the books there is absolutely no indication whatsoever that Bellatrix had gross teeth.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"On the contrary, even despite her decade-and-a-half long stint in Azkaban, Bellatrix’s beauty is still salient enough to be a feature of constant noteworthiness in the mind of the omniscient narrator. Why Rowling might persistently describe Bellatrix as attractive while forgetting to mention her smile resembling that of a Bible-belt meth addict is anyone’s guess. Then again, Rowling also forgot to mention that Hermione was black, so we ought to keep our interpretive expectations low.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"And while it’s true that there is probably no dental care in Azkaban, evidently cosmetic dentistry and orthodontics are easily accessible in the Wizarding World outside of prison, as Hermione’s prominent overbite was corrected within a single afternoon thanks to Madam Pomfrey’s skill. If she left Azkaban with rotted or missing teeth, I can’t imagine Bellatrix, who gives off an unmistakable air of haughty vanity, wouldn’t have them fixed immediately upon release, if only to try for a futile attempt at seducing her dear master.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Hell, maybe Voldemort himself fixed her teeth. He did mention explicitly that when he broke open Azkaban, as compensation for their slavish devotion, he’d reward the Lestrange’s beyond their wildest dreams. Perhaps by “reward them beyond their wildest dreams” he meant he’d cover their dental insurance.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Edit: As always, I must give a big, big thank you to anyone who followed me after reading this answer!",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,How was Molly Weasley able to destroy Bellatrix Lestrange so easily?,0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"It wasn’t… easy… But it didn’t hurt that Trixie was attempting to take the life of another one of Molly’s children, her daughter, Ginny Weasley.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"That injected a jolt of adrenaline in Molly, and from there, she traded curses with Bella until Molly got one just under Bella’s defenses.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"In fairness to the question, this scene should have probably been drawn out a bit more, because it was all over a little too fast. Molly probably hadn’t used her wand as a weapon since she was a girl trading spells with her twin brothers, Fabian and Gideon Prewett, so how she was suddenly able to duel like Albus Dumbledore really leans on suspension of disbelief until it’s creaking under the weight.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"But, the author was winding down the series, and she needed to get to the final battle between Harry and Voldemort. After all, how much sense does it make to have a long duel between two witches, only to turn around and have another duel between two wizards to close out the Second Wizarding War?",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"It would have been better if Bellatrix knocked Molly to her knees, only for the remaining Weasleys all to cast a curse at Bellatrix to destroy her.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"But, that would have required it be Bellatrix who ended Fred’s life to provide poetic justice for such a deed.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"And, that, in turn, would have meant a rewrite that the author was probably loath to expend the energy on after fifteen years of novels and films.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Plus, they were still clinging to the “children’s story” motif — even though we’d already seen murder, torture and necromancy along the way, so just who the hell were they kidding — and it just won’t do to have children killing adults in a story intended to eventually hit the silver screen and targeting towards teenagers and preteens.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Since there couldn’t be teenagers using the Killing Curse to perfection, it was simpler to just have Molly quickly dispatch Bellatrix, so they could move on to the final faceoff between Harry and Voldemort.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"She is motivated by love and loyalty, even though she has given them to an unworthy object, and we don’t know what she was like before she spent about 15 years being psychically tortured by Dementors.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"What she did to the Longbottoms was terrible, but as Vold War One Aurors they themselves were torturers or the colleagues of torturers, and from her point of view she tortured two torturers in an attempt to find and save her beloved Tom from being tortured and then having his soul destroyed by Dementors.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"My guess is that she was always a few screws short of a hardware store, but not unhinged the way she is by the time we meet her.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Bellatrix, like her sisters, is endlessly interesting. She revels in the violence and cruelty that being at the top of the Death Eater food chain allows her to indulge in.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Bellatrix knows how to behave, well, reasonably normally. She snaps at Draco once and Narcissa immediately flares up, warning her not to speak to him that way and suggesting that Bella could pass for some variation of nicety if she wanted to. Her and Narcissa’s behavior to Kreacher suggests the same. She also doesn’t believe that her sister would hurt her, implying that she would not hurt her sister, so she’s not totally off her rocker in that sense at least.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"I’d say that Bellatrix probably had an inclination towards violent instability from the start, but could pass for normal until she didn’t need to any longer. I don’t think Azkaban was what put her sanity out to pasture. The impetus there was probably the deadly combination of her inherent desire to cause pain and Voldemort’s desire for such a lieutenant.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"The Lord of the Rings trilogy is an all time favourite, as I’m a huge fan of fantasy, especially of the medieval variety. And come on, nothing comes close to Tolkien’s work in that regard.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Otherwise:
Girl, Interrupted is perhaps is a big one for me and pretty much /the/ example of a Psychological Drama, though I can’t put my finger on why I like it so much. I just do. Maybe it’s Angelina Jolie’s brilliant performance, maybe it’s the whole setting and atmosphere. I’m not sure.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Horror’s a miss or hit for me, honestly. I either really like it, or don’t want anything to do with it.
I love the Blair Witch Project, and again, its psychological impact does it for me much like Girl, Interrupted. Its sequel Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2 is generally considered a poor film, and straight up terrible as a sequel of an amazing indie project.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"And despite that…I quite like it. Don’t get me wrong, the criticism is legit. But I like it, guilty pleasure I suppose.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"And while we’re at it:
Queen of the Damned. In this case I straight up disagree with the critics, no guilty pleasure nonsense here. It’s a shame that Aaliyah didn’t live to see the cult status it received years after. Such a sweet girl, gone way too soon.",0

1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"* Coraline. An absolute masterpiece of a film, with just enough horror in it to be spooky but not enough to actually scare me.

 * Corpse Bride is probably my favorite Burton film. I’m ambivalent about a lot of them, but I like this one for its aesthetic and story.
 * ParaNorman (noticing a theme here?). I thought this was just a Sixth Sense-style zombie flick, but it’s actually really clever, with a surprisingly poignant message about how fear affects people. I was impressed by it.
 * Interview With the Vampire. In my opinion, the best vampire film ever made. Not only is it true to its source material, but the acting is superb.
 * The Sixth Sense. No wonder this film is a classic. I actually really like it, and I like that it’s not really trying to scare the audience. It’s chilling without being an outright horror movie.
 * Young Frankenstein. That’s FRAHNK-in-steen!
 * What We Do in the Shadows. I was thrilled when this became a TV series. It’s a mockumentary about vampires that portrays the vampires struggling through modern life, in all its painful awkwardness.
 * Dorian Gray (2009). It takes some liberties with its source material, but captures the darkness and decadence perfectly. Hedonism, bisexuality, sex, murder, depravity, corruption, all that good stuff.
 * The Ninth Gate: The most realistically occult film I’ve ever seen, not for its plot but for its use of symbolism. An Analysis of The Ninth Gate [ https://forbiddenknowledge.quora.com/An-Analysis-of-The-Ninth-Gate ]
 * Crimson Peak: I didn’t even realize this film existed for years, because I confused it with Twin Peaks. When I finally saw it, I fell in love. It is a love letter to the gothic!",0

I waited for years to watch this film, because as a child, I thought that mixing holidays was utterly blasphemous. I consider it a Christmas movie, because every day is Halloween but it’s only Christmas in the time between Thanksgiving and New Years.’ I also could have sworn that this film came out in my lifetime, because I remember seeing it advertised on placemats and cups in Applebees, and of course there’s a cascade of merchandise every year. Imagine my shock when I learned it was released in 1993! I’m kind of amazed it’s as popular as it is, since it seems to be made for a niche audience. Overall, it holds up quite well. It’s cute, it’s festive, it has endearing characters, and its aesthetic is stellar.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Coraline: Another stop-motion film, and one of my absolute favorites! This is the story of a girl who finds a door to another world that’s a mirror of her own, but better. But her Other Parents have buttons sewn over their eyes, and that’s the first sign that the otherworld is actually very sinister. I remember seeing the trailer for it as a child, and the image of those two buttons in the box haunted me. That is a testament to just how unsettling this story is! I remember seeing the book in a classroom, with its creepy cover, and thinking, Oh, that’s the book about the girl whose doll mother wants to turn her into a doll. When I later learned it was by Neil Gaiman, I knew I had to read it. I watched the film first, and fell in love with it.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"The film is mostly very faithful to the book, and it manages to be equally whimsical and disturbing, with excellent atmosphere. It’s an unusual example of a horror film with children as its target audience. It’s designed to scare children based on ideas that children can relate to. Some of the more terrifying parts of the book (like Coraline's fight with what became of the Other Father) are toned down, but it's still very creepy and it still captures the surreal, sinister tone of the novel.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Corpse Bride: Yet another spooky stop-motion film, and actually directed by Tim Burton this time. I think this is my favorite Tim Burton film that I’ve seen. It's an adorable and romantic film about a socially awkward Victorian boy who accidentally marries a dead woman (it makes sense in context), while practicing for his marriage to his (still living) fianceé. Hijinks ensue. There's also this evil guy called Lord Barkus that gets in the way. Barkus. Don't you want that to be your name? (I suppose it's better than Everglot.)

Honestly, I think it’s still a good film regardless. It’s a fun Halloween movie, and the overall gothic feel of the mansion is just too cool to pass up in my opinion. It’s got ghosts and mystery and undead armies and breathing doors, and I’m drooling over the furniture. It’s a guilty pleasure.",0

Its aesthetic is gorgeous. It has “Romantigoth” written all over it! But… on the other hand… I didn’t fully understand people’s criticisms of this film until I actually saw the stage musical. When I did, I thought that “Music of the Night” was one of the most beautiful songs I’ve ever heard, and instantly fell in love with it! And I realized that I didn’t remember anything of the song from this film. I remembered the setting, but not the melody, not even the lyrics (which speak to me on a deep and personal level). This film made “Music of the Night” forgettable. It’s a song so seductive it makes a disfigured man who lives in a basement with a waifu and wears a fedora seem sexy, but this film made it forgettable! Because they cast an actor who can’t really sing, to play a character who is defined by his beautiful singing voice. But I’m keeping this film on the list, because I think that if you can’t see the stage musical, this is certainly better than nothing, and again it may be worth the watch for the aesthetic alone.",0

If you like spooky but prefer comedy to horror, you should watch it. ...I wish I had a castle like that.",0

(I’m reading the book now, so I’ll come back to this with updates once I finish.) Though Disney guarantees a happy ending, this does not feel like a Disney film. This is a story about two boys, Will and Jim, who visit a mysterious carnival that shows up in October. Don't let the slow leadup fool you — this comes close to being a psychological horror film. The carnival is much more sinister than the boys originally realize. I liked the psychological touch to this film, which reminded me of my own work. Though Le Cirque des Rêves is not sinister, I could clearly see the influence Something Wicked had on The Night Circus. This one's definitely worth watching at least once. (Mr. Dark has excellent fashion sense, and I'm sure that he and his carnival people are particularly nasty Shadows.)",0

This was the first animated Disney film to get a PG rating, if that tells you anything. It was loosely based on a book/series of books, and has a high fantasy setting. If you like Dungeons and Dragons or The Lord of the Rings, you might like it. It's about a wannabe hero and his friends who stop an evil lich king from acquiring the One Ring, I mean Horcrux, I mean Black Cauldron, a powerful object that is the essence of evil itself. The lich, called the Horned King (uh... not sure how I feel about that), uses the cauldron to resurrect an army of undead soldiers. Definitely darker than most Disney films, especially for its time. It has a creepier color scheme and a slightly different animation style from other Disney films. Maybe it would have done better had it been released now. I'm a sucker for high fantasy and anything creepy, so I gave it a watch.",0

(""You haven't done the dishes in five years!"" *cut to huge pile of bloody dishes in the sink*) It's also pretty difficult to get into nightclubs if you can't enter a room without being invited. In short, what would modern life be like for the average vampire? I like seeing vampires in everyday situations, and the sheer awkwardness and hilarity of their shenanigans. It’s like a movie-length SNL sketch, and I mean that as a compliment. It has so many quotable lines!

I expected that the protagonist would leave her war-torn world for a dark and magical one. Nope. This is not a fantasy film. This is a bloody, violent war drama and a gruesome tragedy, with fantasy elements. Actually, I think this one could legitimately be considered horror, and it does have a well-deserved R rating. Some of those fantasy elements (okay, a fair few) were really predictable. However, it's still a beautiful film with fantastic imagery. I loved the protagonist, and the faun. I'd still recommend it, but you have to know what you are getting into. If you would prefer something lighter, I'd suggest the other Labyrinth. You know which one I'm talking about.",0

(In the Bela Lugosi version, Renfield goes to Castle Dracula. Renfield. RENFIELD!) It follows the plot of the book pretty closely, except for the stupid reincarnation thing. I actually would have really liked the love story, if it were its own thing. Mina Harker is not in love with Dracula.

[ https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-think-about-Mina-and-Dracula-s-relationship-in-the-movie-Bram-Stoker-s-Dracula-Do-you-ship-them/answer/Sarah-McLean-11 ] Seriously, I need a Dracula adaptation that actually does Mina justice! This film was a bit corny, and there were some characterizations that I thought were off (Lucy, van Helsing, Harker, Mina), but it includes elements of the book that are absent in other adaptations, such as Dracula's imperviousness to sunlight, and the way he gets younger when well-fed, and the existence of Quincy Morris. It also references the epistolary element of the novel. I do appreciate the visuals, and you've got to love Gary Oldman. If you're going to watch a Dracula movie, watch this one, because it is the most accurate to the book, and it has a beautiful gothic atmosphere and visuals.",0

Although it’s not completely accurate to the book and it got mixed reviews, I think that it perfectly captures the spirit of the novel. It’s dark, it’s decadent, it’s sensual, and it’s gay by 2009 standards. Hedonism, bisexuality, sex, murder, depravity, corruption, all that good stuff. It misses some of the thematic depth of the original, but I think it makes up for that because it’s got the Victorian gothic look and feel down. And the acting from the three leads is pretty on-point.",0

I expected this to be a generic zombie flick about a Cole Sear knockoff, but I was pleasantly surprised by this film. The protagonist, Norman, can see and speak to the dead, viewing them as a normal part of his life (even if he looks insane to everyone else). He has to use his gift to appeal to the emotions of a malignant spirit, a witch who was put to death centuries ago, to end her zombie curse for good. This film is actually quite insightful, and it contains a poignant message about the way fear affects people. I cried at the end. Worth the watch.",0

I'm so glad I saw this. It's a dark and decadent Affectionate Parody of gothic tropes, and it does vampire romance RIGHT! The vampire romance in this show is everything Twilight should have been: A young girl is irresistibly drawn into the embrace of night by a seductive vampire who promises to fulfill her fantasies and dark desires if she will only surrender. It's beautiful, and provided some serious inspiration for Shadowbook. My favorite songs from it are ""Total Eclipse"" (like the pop song, but darker and with more vampires), and ""Carpe Noctem"" (epic, sexy rock song). This story also addresses the cursed monotony of eternal life the way Rice's books do, and the reality of having to take victims, without ever experiencing real intimacy. It's a rarity in that it shows the perspectives of both the vampires and the vampire-hunters. The music is fun, the sets and costumes are amazing.

1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"The Ninth Gate: I have no idea why it took me so long to watch this! This is a very spooky film starring Johnny Depp as an expert on rare books. (It's not directed by Tim Burton, it's actually by Roman Polanski who's also the guy behind Tanz, but he is very problematic and we do not stan.) He's commissioned to authenticate a spooky grimoire designed to conjure the Devil himself. I really appreciated the numerous references to real-life occultism in this film. The fictional grimoire (called The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows — awesome, right?) is clearly modeled after real ones, there are some cameos of real grimoires, and the woodcuts in the fictional grimoire are obviously inspired by tarot imagery. That makes it feel very authentic, even if the context is not. Studying the occult does require a lot of reading, but don't worry, it isn't this unsettling. I love the dark academia aesthetic of this film, and love the nods to real occultism. My full analysis of it is here: An Analysis of The Ninth Gate [ https://forbiddenknowledge.quora.com/An-Analysis-of-The-Ninth-Gate ]",0

Everything gorgeous, gothic, period dress, sepias and reds and blacks and dark teal and stark white... And of course, it's Guillermo del Toro! And it stars an aspiring novelist because of course it does! And TOM HIDDLESTON is in it! The film is about an aspiring writer named Edith, who falls for a dark and brooding and mysterious baronet (who, as it happens, is also named Thomas), and follows him back home to this big creepy mansion where he lives with his sister. The mansion is obviously haunted, and there is something very wrong going on between these two siblings. Like, “The Fall of the House of Usher”-wrong. Edith starts seeing extremely disturbing red ghosts, and is wasting away from Victorian Novel Disease as she tries to solve the mystery.",0

My only complaint is that Edith, who starts off this film being a carbon copy of Jo from Little Women, loses all her not-like-other-girls spunk halfway through. She just becomes a stereotypical gothic heroine dying of consumption. They had an opportunity to write a Genre Savvy protagonist, but they didn’t really take it. Despite that, this whole film is a love letter to the gothic, and I can forgive its tropiness because it's clearly playing off of familiar aspects of the genre.

This is a list of spooky movies that I think most Goths would enjoy, and about half are kids' films. There are no horror movies on this list, because I'm not a huge fan of horror. Horror stories I love, but horror movies? No thanks. I also left classic monster movies off this list because most people have mentioned them already. I will add to this list as I watch more movies.)",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"The Nightmare Before Christmas— I'll start off this list with a familiar holiday classic. Pretty self-explanatory, this one.

1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Coraline— A frightening and whimsical adaptation of Neil Gaiman's novel, and another Selik creation. I love this film. It's fairly true to the book, with one added character that I think was a very good addition. Some of the more terrifying parts of the book (like Coraline's fight with what became of the Other Father) are toned down, but it's still very creepy and it still captures the surreal, sinister tone of the novel.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Corpse Bride— Yet another creepy stop motion film. This one actually was directed by Tim Burton. Seriously, every film by Tim Burton could be on this list, but this is my favorite of his that I've seen. It's an adorable and romantic film about a socially awkward Victorian boy who accidentally marries a dead woman (it makes sense in context). Hilarity ensues as he tries to figure out what to do with his situation, as he's engaged to another (still living) woman that he very quickly fell in love with. There's also this evil guy called Lord Barkus that gets in the way. Barkus. Don't you want that to be your name? I suppose it's better than Everglot. Is it?",0

Full of ghosts, mystery, and undead armies, it's more of a dream than a nightmare, in my opinion. I loved this one. I swear those dining chairs came from Haunt Furniture. If I had $2000, I would totally get one of those chairs! Until I'm a world famous writer and as rich as JKR, I'll just drool.",0

1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"The Sixth Sense— A classic, and very spooky. I like this film because it's chilling without being an outright horror movie.

Everyone should see this at least once.",0

1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Young Frankenstein: That's FRAHNK-in-steen! A classic Mel Brooks comedy that makes fun of gothic horror in general, and uses/reuses all your favorite jokes from other Mel Brooks movies. It's as quotable as all the rest, and entertaining regardless of its relevance to the original novel. If you're a Goth who prefers comedy to horror, you should watch it. ...I wish I had a castle like that.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Something Wicked This Way Comes: An old, fairly obscure live-action Disney movie, based on Ray Bradbury's book of the same name. I haven't read the book, so I can't say much about how it relates to the book (though after reading the summary on Wikipedia, it seems to follow the plot closely enough). Though Disney guarantees a happy ending, this does not feel like a Disney film. This is a story about two boys, Will and Jim, who visit a mysterious carnival that shows up in October. Don't let the slow leadup fool you-- this comes close to being a psychological horror film. The carnival is much more sinister than the boys originally realize. I liked the psychological touch to this film, which reminded me of my own work. Though Le Cirque des Rêves is not sinister, I could clearly see the influence Something Wicked had on The Night Circus. This one's definitely worth watching at least once. (Mr. Dark has excellent fashion sense, and I'm sure that he and his carnival people are particularly nasty Shadows.) I'm definitely going to have to read the novel.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"The Black Cauldron: Another obscure Disney film, from the 1980s. This was the first animated Disney film to get a PG rating, if that tells you anything. It was loosely based on a book/series of books, and has a high fantasy setting. If you like Dungeons and Dragons or The Lord of the Rings, you might like it. It's about a wannabe hero and his friends who stop an evil lich king from acquiring the One Ring— wait, no— Horcrux— wait, no… the Black Cauldron, a powerful object that is the essence of evil itself. The lich, called the Horned King (uh... kind of offensive to pagans?), uses the cauldron to resurrect an army of undead soldiers. Definitely darker than most Disney films, especially for its time. It definitely had a creepier color scheme and animation style than other Disney films. However, it bombed at the box office and almost collapsed the industry, so you wouldn't have heard of it before. Maybe it would have done better had it been released now. I'm a sucker for high fantasy and anything creepy, so I gave it a watch.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Dark Shadows: A Tim Burton film based off of a TV show of the same name. Very gothy, with plenty of ghosts and vampires, family curses, beautiful interior design, and the signature style of Tim Burton. However, it does not portray witches well.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"What We Do in the Shadows: A hilarious New Zealand mockumentary about a bunch of vampires who share a flat. They dress in styles from their respective eras, have wildly different personalities, and have to deal with paying rent and doing chores in addition to hunting humans. (""You haven't done the dishes in five years!"" *cut to huge pile of bloody dishes in the sink*) It's also pretty difficult to get into nightclubs if you can't enter a room without being invited. In short, what would modern life be like for the average vampire? I also highly recommend the new TV series, which is the same general premise, but concerning a different group of vampires on Staten Island.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Pan's Labyrinth: I was excited to watch this. I expected that it would be Alice in Wonderland with darker themes and imagery. It wasn't. I expected that the protagonist would leave her war-torn world for a dark and magical one. Nope. This is not a fantasy film. This is a bloody, violent war drama and a gruesome tragedy, with fantasy elements. Actually, I think this one could legitimately be considered horror, and it does have a well-deserved R rating. Some of those fantasy elements (okay, a fair few) were really predictable. However, it's still a beautiful film with fantastic imagery. I loved the protagonist, and the faun. I'd still recommend it, but you have to know what you are getting into. If you would prefer something lighter, I'd suggest the other Labyrinth. You know which one I'm talking about.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Bram Stoker's Dracula: *sigh* I've been on a crusade to find a good Dracula film, and of them all, this was the most accurate to the book. (In the Bela Lugosi version, Renfield goes to Castle Dracula. Renfield. RENFIELD!) It follows the plot pretty closely, except for the stupid reincarnation thing. That was not a better love story than Twilight. Mina is not in love with Dracula. Seriously, I need a Dracula adaptation that actually does Mina justice! This film was a bit corny, and there were some characterizations that I thought were off (Lucy, van Helsing, Harker, Mina), but it includes elements of the book that are absent in other adaptations, such as Dracula's imperviousness to sunlight, and the way he gets younger when well-fed, and the existence of Quincy Morris. It also references the epistolary element of the novel. I do love the visuals, and you've got to love Gary Oldman. If you're going to watch a Dracula movie, watch this one, because it is the most accurate to the book, and it has a beautiful gothic atmosphere and visuals.",0

It got mixed reviews, I think mostly based on book accuracy, but it was dark and sensual and sexy. Hedonism, bisexuality, sex, murder, depravity, corruption, all that good stuff. CHRISTIAN Gray? Girl, you ain't seen nothin' until you met DORIAN Gray! Definitely recommend, especially if you want to see an actual film in which two men kiss.

At first, it seems like a zombie flick about an I-See-Dead-People kid named Norman, but it turns out to be surprisingly insightful and beautiful. Norman has to use his gift to appeal to the emotions of a malignant spirit, to put off her curse for good. It contains an important message about the way fear affects people. Worth the watch.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"The Ninth Gate: I have no idea why it took me so long to watch this! This is a very spooky flim starring Johnny Depp as an expert on rare books. (It's not directed by Tim Burton, it's actually by Roman Polanski who's the guy behind Tanz, but he is very problematic and we do not stan.) He's commissioned to authenticate a spooky grimoire designed to conjure the Devil himself. I really appreciated the numerous references to real-life occultism in this film. The fictional grimoire (called The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows -- awesome, right?) is clearly modeled after real ones, there are some cameos of real grimoires, and the woodcuts in the fictional grimoire are obviously inspired by tarot imagery. That makes it feel very authentic, even if the context is not. Studying the occult does require a lot of reading, but don't worry, it isn't this unsettling.",0

Created by the late artist Michael Turner, Fathom revolves around an aquatic heroine named Aspen, a part Fox had hoped would lead to her own solo comic book franchise. It wasn't even a lark or a career move for the actress, but rather something of a passion project. ""I want someone who loves her and loves the comic to play her. It doesn't have to be me, but I just didn't know of any actresses at the time who loved the comic or even knew about it,"" Fox told MTV (via Comicvine) in 2009 . ""So I was sort of fiercely protective of it, because I didn't want it played by someone who doesn't give a s**t.""",0

That's almost a job requirement for movie star, but it's also a double-edged sword — good-looking actors and actresses often struggle with being typecast. Fox has discussed her frustrations with this, getting roles in movies designed to show off her looks and sex appeal that don't provide a chance to show off her acting chops. ""You have these stereotypes that still dominate films: the nag, the trophy, the escort,"" Fox told the New York Times. ""I haven't been sent a nag script yet, but I do get plenty of, like, 'interesting stripper.'""",0

(A Philadelphia Inquirer review said Fox was ""a smarter kind of hot"" in the film.) And while movies are a team effort between writers, directors, producers, studio executives, crew members, and actors, it's the latter who ultimately serve as the face of the project and receive the most criticism. For example, Fox has been ""honored"" with six Razzie Awards recognizing her performances in not-great movies (Jonah Hex, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen) that didn't give her much to work with.",0

Once he has made his calculations, he gets to work. It’s said that the physics of boxing are simple: All other things being equal, the bigger body usually wins. But with Mayweather, equality is hard to come by. He’s not a mauler, not a bruiser; he is quicker and smarter. More complex physical laws come into play: the dynamic mechanics of motion, the thermodynamics of the mind.",0

You could see what kind of boxer he would be from the start, from the time he fought his first world title fight, against Genaro Hernandez in 1998. You could see it in the way he carried himself, in his preternatural patience, a floating stillness — even though he never stopped moving. He ducked and dipped, curled right and left, darted in and out, dropped his hands and raised them. Sometimes he’d stretch his right arm out with a kind of quiet intention, not jabbing so much as measuring the distance. By the end of the fight, he was in control; he could set his feet and throw. But what stands out now is what happened in the middle rounds, when Mayweather started holding himself the way a snake holds its head, at once coiling and recoiling, simultaneously defensive and ready to strike. He would throw that lethal lead right and simultaneously disappear from Hernandez’s line of sight.",0

A few months after that, according to a lawsuit that Brim later filed, Brim and Mayweather were at a mall together with their daughter when Mayweather, after asking a friend to hold Ayanna, punched Brim in the neck.

They were occasions for glamour — for furs and tuxes, for Toots Shor’s and Muhammad Ali — and also for Mob ties, hush money, and a long string of sad stories about boxers whose lives were chewed up. Even in its heyday, boxing was a fun-house mirror for society, exaggerating the best and worst in men. Joe Louis, Ike Williams, Sonny Liston — the list of fighters who lived broken lives and broke others could go on and on.

 * Not a risk taker, started off slow for observation purposes. He fought to always be up on points and no more than he really had to unless a sure opportunity was there.
 * His stance is left arm out in front or low with left shoulder in front to tuck in and protect his left side of chin. Many punches he receives hits his shoulder as he rolls it to deflect the force. He keeps his right hand up protecting his right side of chin with glove. His left arm is used to keep distance between him and opponent, a quick figuration of range so he can pop in and out of the fighters “pocket”. The left arm also serves as a lever to maintain balance at all times.
 * His stance is wide and angled making him a small target. Back foot makes for a great stabilizer for balance and is able to move front foot in (to land punches and out to avoid getting hit) of the “pocket quickly.
 * He is an incredibly quick puncher due to natural plus well developed fast twitch muscle, though I wouldn't say the most powerful. When he throws he combines it with a bob and weave or slip for extra safe measure.
 * He likes to taunt his opponents for 5–6 rounds making them believe have a chance of winning. This drops the opponent's guard while they start to feel confident. Showboating often at this point. That is when Mayweather begins to pick up on the opponents weaknesses.
 * He sits just outside of the ""pocket"" (as mentioned before), leaning in to make easier to slip punches with short, quick jolts moving head to sides and back.
 * He backs up an opponent still from slightly out of range from pocket with what looks like a gallop. He had a forward hop jump with his punches that doubles the power of his whole body moving forward at a very quick, snap speed.
 * He fights very well off the ropes with constant head and torso movement, keeping his chin tucked in left shoulder rolling with the punches, never leaving himself as a sitting duck.
 * Most of his rounds he stays in center ring leaving him free to move any direction he pleases.

In fact, I don’t think any other fighter during their prime years has ever recorded a higher percentage of first round knockouts.

Now, there are obviously a number of differences in this scenario. First, Toney was a natural Middle weight. He fought at Heavy weight far past his prime, and when he was grossly out of shape. Secondly, they are using MMA gloves. Third, he is in there with Randy Couture, a natural Heavyweight, and a two division champion, still very near his prime. Randy walked around in shape at about 230 pounds. He was essentially the same weight as “Iron Mike”. Khabib, however, walks around somewhere under 190 pounds when not training. That means he is probably giving up 40 or so pounds to a guy that literally grew up in street fights. And while Khabib would certainly try to engage, and if he does get inside, remember that Tyson fought a lot! As in, when he was pre-teen, he had been in several fights already. Street fights. By the age of 13, he had been ARRESTED 38 times! Against most boxers, boxers that didn’t have the crime and fight riddled upbringing of Tyson, Khabib would dominate. And in a MATCH against Khabib, Tyson stands next to no chance. But in the one documented bare knuckle punch he threw as a pro, the damage was devastating and life altering. And remember, Tyson was trying to flee. He threw one punch in a self defense situation. See, Mitch wasn’t just a Pro boxer. He was ALSO the leader of a ruthless street gang in NY at the time. What do you think would happen to Khabib if Tyson throws a hook? Or a short uppercut? lacerations and facial fractures, that is what happens. And I am sure Khabib could get Tyson on the ground. Ever see a real street fight? They end up on the ground EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. And Tyson had been in, he estimated, over 50 fights before he even started boxing!

But in that same note, most Martial Arts focus on the exercise aspect. (And I’ve heard people say Judo is no good other than in Judo competitions) ??? In other words, the majority of the disciplines and their students wouldn’t know the first thing about a street fight. Even in sparring, it’s almost like it’s choreographed… if someone does something outside of that discipline specific set of movements, it would throw the practitioner for a loop. Not all, but most. Boxing is more adaptive to street fighting than martial arts. And for that matter, wrestling is more adaptive than both! Trust me on this one; I have hundreds of street fights under my belt and wrestling techniques have been the most beneficial in winning the confrontation. If the first punch doesn’t knock them out, it is almost always going to end up becoming a close-quarters fight (grappling).",0

Those dudes are bad ass! I will give a trained fighter involved in MMA competitions the advantage any day over a one dimensional practitioner. MMA has its limitations too though. For instance, some styles wouldn’t adapt well to the octagon because they focus on breaking bones or ending fights very quickly. Krav Maga is one of these styles I believe.

Asking a striker to make 10 dribbles as if asking a fullback to score a hatty","Lionel Messi: The 5 Biggest Faults with the Barcelona Star's Game When it comes to picking the best player in modern day world football, most football fans select FC Barcelona's Lionel Messi without a second thought. Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo always has his supporters, and occasionally Barcelona's Xavi and Andres Iniesta are in the conversation, but the majority of fans tend to overwhelmingly vote for Lionel Messi. Simply put, Lionel Messi is the best dribbler and finisher in football today. If you need someone to produce a moment of magic, and top it off with a clinical finish, look no further than Lionel Messi, because no one can get the job done better than he can. And yet, as I wrote for Cristiano Ronaldo's faults article, no footballer, past or present, can be considered faultless. Lionel Messi is the best in the world in multiple aspects of the beautiful game, but there are other aspects which he could improve on to become an even more unstoppable player.",0

Asking a striker to make 10 dribbles as if asking a fullback to score a hatty","Lionel Messi, as we've known him, has almost always been quiet and reserved, preferring to do his job on the pitch and let others do the talking in the media. At Barcelona, this has worked out excellently. The team is stacked with strong leadership figures, like Xavi and Puyol, as well as experienced professionals, like Eric Abidal and David Villa. So Lionel Messi is allowed to focus on his primary duty: putting the ball in the back of the net. But with Argentina, Lionel Messi does not have this luxury. Aside from Javier Mascherano, the current Argentina national team squad is heavily lacking in leadership, despite the abundance of talent on the squad. Now that Messi is the captain of the national team, the responsibility of leading and motivating the team primarily falls on his shoulders. This does not mean that Messi must all of a sudden become a media magnet—the way Cristiano Ronaldo can be at times—but it means that he must be strong and vocal when his team needs inspiration; both to media and when communicating on the pitch. If Messi can do this, then he will help the Argentinian national team overcome the failures of the last few years and finally live up to their potential once again.",0

Asking a striker to make 10 dribbles as if asking a fullback to score a hatty","Lionel Messi is actually not a bad free kick taker. This video shows that Messi is actually pretty capable of scoring some wonderful free kicks. But a closer look at the video shows while Messi's aim and precision is usually very impressive, the power behind his free kicks is lacking. Practically every free kick goal Messi has scored has come from withing 25 yards, whereas almost all of Messi's free kicks from farther out are either misses or result in corners. For Barcelona, Messi is not the primary free kick taker, so there isn't really much that needs to be done there. For Argentina, however, Messi is the primary free kick taker, and therefore Messi must either learn to pass more from more distant free kicks—rather than go for goal—or build up more strength if he wants to be a more complete and successful free kick taker.",1

Asking a striker to make 10 dribbles as if asking a fullback to score a hatty","Because Lionel Messi is so good at dribbling and nearly unstoppable in attack at times, it is a little known fact that he is actually rather one-footed. He can do nearly anything with his left foot, but he generally avoids using his right foot if possible. What this hurts is Lionel Messi's flexibility in attack. He can perform well as a right winger, the position he played in when first introduced into the Barcelona starting lineup, or as a No. 9, his current position. But beyond those positions, Messi cannot perform—or, at least, has not performed—at his best. This has been especially evident with Argentina, as manager after manager has struggled to get the best out of the young star. Because of the abundance of center-forwards on the team, many Argentina national team managers have tried to play Messi in the hole behind the striker, or even as an attacking midfielder, but these systems have not brought about long-lasting success. It is impossible to tell if Messi will ever find a position with Argentina in which he truly flourishes, but at present this is a problem for both Messi and his country which really needs fixing.",1

Asking a striker to make 10 dribbles as if asking a fullback to score a hatty","Just as Lionel Messi's free kicks from distance aren't great, the same can be said for his shots. Like his free kicks, Lionel Messi is capable of shooting from outside the box. That much can be seen here. But in looking at the video, it is clear that Lionel Messi isn't a player who will blast the ball into the net from 30-plus yards out. Most of the goals in the video are goals taken from the edge of the box, and the video itself in the first place represents a significant minority of Messi's goals. Lionel Messi is a No. 9 who prefers placement over power. The reason why Messi's inability to score from outside is highlighted here is that it would definitely be a tool that would greatly benefit him with Argentina, seeing as how he isn't used as a center-forward or a No. 9 when on national duty.",1

Yeah yeah some folks will say that Santos beat Inter Milan/AC Milan Liverpool and others in world club trophic competition but these are one maybe 2 games and are nothing get compared to actually playing in Italy each week, which was more or less the top of football when he was playing. So we can never really know how great Pele actually is in comparison. It also doesn't help that his goal scoring records has been allowed to be tainted with stupid friendlies etc. I personally love Pele but due to the fact he has 3 World Cup winners trophies/medal this kinda makes him untouchable. Back then international football was the most important part of the great game. Now it is not near that level of importance. The power of the clubs over a player national team is incredible",0

Messi’ football statistics will look incredibly anomalous when compared to all other players during his time in football.

Asking a striker to make 10 dribbles as if asking a fullback to score a hatty","No Lionel Messi is not overrated. He is without a shadow of a doubt the best player of any era in any position in the entire history of football. International football has gone downhill since the early to mid 90s. But don't take my opinion as truth do a bit of research to check that my international football claim is true.This means that club football and especially the champions league really is the pinnacle of the game. Pep Guardiola sold Ronaldinho and Deco just one season after Ronaldinho won the World’s best player award because he knew that he was going to build a team around the boy who was 16 years old named Lionel Messi. Can you imagine trying to convince the Barca club owners that it was in their best interest to sell off the truly incredible Ronaldinho to build at team around a 16 year old!?!? It actually beggars belief. Within 2 seasons Barcelona had stamped their reputation as one of, if not the best club team of all time producing football that revolutionised the game. At the heart of this was Messi. It helps that Xavi, Iniesta Alves Pique etc were all pretty decent footballers too (I'm using understatement as a joke here folks). Can you remember going into work or school or university after the Barca v Real Madrid games where Barca destroyed them 5–0 going on 55 nil. I remember explaining what the game was like to one of my mates and simply didn't have the words to describe how incredible they were.",1

He is 30 now but doesn't actually look less of a player. His experience is so vast that he can keep him self in position using experience just as much as raw speed. But in all honesty I watch Barcelona at least once a week and he still looks as sharp as he did when he was 28 or 26 or 24 etc. Folks talk about Maradona and luckily I remember him playing and he was a phenomenon. What he did at the 86 world cup was astonishing as was his achievements with Napoli. But bar the World Cup he was never under the crazy scrutiny of stats and world wide tv audiences on a week to week basis like Messi has been. And it inners very rare that Messi doesn't perform. Imagine how many folks watch him per game watching for him to do some amazing things week in week out and very rarely does he let folks down. Maradona was was never even close to being under that intensity. Further to this Maradona destroyed his career with Cocaine and his involvement with gangs in Naples. Messi has played week in week out from aged 16 to his current age of 30 without much injury. He just wants to play football like he did when he was a 7 years old in Argentina.,1

Moreover lets take the standard of the league-what is the performance of PL clubs in Europe’s premier competition CL from the turn of the decade. You have one winner in Chelsea and one runner up in Manchester United. At the same time, Spanish club have been in a final or won it on four occasions and twice it was a all-Spanish final. PL is just more competitive because the difference in quality is less. The quality of La liga is higher than PL(remember the Sevilla-Liverpool final of last season).

Asking a striker to make 10 dribbles as if asking a fullback to score a hatty","If you considering Messi as a a goal scorer then you are right .he is scoring less goals as you mentioned like he used to do from 2008 -2012 .but if you see his impact on the match or on the team win it is even better than ever .In that time xavi ,iniesta ,bousqets were at there prime they used to feed Messi and Messi was playing in the front to score goals .Now xavi is gone and iniesta is getting injured and bousquets is out of form which is a big problem for Barcelona .If you see there mid field it's not as good as it used to be .so Messi now playing in back and he is doing the role of xavi +iniesta to feed the ball to suraez and Neymar .i would say Suarez is the biggest beneficiary of this .even playing in back also Messi is scoring a lot of goals .he is giving more assists now better free kick taker than ever probably best in world now .i will give an example of his role is copa del ray semifinal against atletico .in the first leg he scored a beautiful goal which he scored from outside the box as there were 7 defenders were waiting to stop him from scoring .but he took it from outside the box and it was one the goal that became very vital at the end .in the second leg the goal scored by suraez was a deflected from goal keeper which was hit by Messi after passing through many defenders .he tried a good free kick which was deflected by the bar .look sometimes scoring goals is not everything .but Messi is not getting the support he needs from his teammate so he is helping them by playing more deep and more involved in the game .replacing xavi iniesta,Dani alve,bousqets is not a simple job .they were worlds best players .always remember football is a team game with out a good team no player can be better .player might do some sort of magic to do one goal dribbles and pass 5 players and score a goal .in every match you can’t do that also .By the way never say Messi is useless .if he is useless then why whole world in running mad behind him .i feel he is at his prime now .so don’t judge by number of goals enjoy the play my friend .you will never see anyone like home again .once he will retire you will understand who he was and at that time you will watch only YouTube to see him play .",0

While talking to a man at a travel agency waiting for a bus, our conversation moved towared more spiritual belief structures. We talked specifically about Karma. Karma is crudely described as the idea that if you do good things for others, you will be rewarded in your next life, or even possibly in this one. Regardless of whether or not you believe in Karma, the very dynamic nature of living on this planet and interacting with other beings makes Karma a logical concept. Let’s just say that if you are living in a community, and you do things to help forward that community, you will create benefit for others, which in turn will create benefits for yourself.",0
1453100585507442688,"Bill Gates is an evil, motherfucking con artist. https://t.co/BeZmSZ3D0z","The man I was speaking to said: Giving money is not good karma, nor bad karma. If you give someone money, they may use that money to do anything they want. They may use it for things that are considered “good” or things that are considered “bad” no matter what the terms of you donating this money to them state. If you donate money to a person on the street, they may use it to buy drugs like heroine and harm themselves or others. However, if you actually give them something that solves one of their problems, you can consider this “good” karma. An example he gave was that, let’s say you go to a school, and you see that they have no ventilation. An act that would be considered “good” would be to buy them a ceiling fan or an air conditioning unit. However if you simply donate money to the school, there is no guarantee that they will use that money to solve their problem.",0
1453100585507442688,"Bill Gates is an evil, motherfucking con artist. https://t.co/BeZmSZ3D0z","Therefore, the act of donating money is neither good nor bad. In his words, it does not give you Karma. The money can be mismanaged and used for something “bad”. A great example of this that I’ve seen in the world was in Peru. In one city I visited, there there was a natural disaster the previous year. The entire city was destroyed. I literally stayed in the only hotel left standing. There was a donation drive started in part by the local government, with help from other governments internationally collecting millions of dollars to help rebuild the city. So why was the city still in ruin a year later with no obvious signs of reconstruction? Well, the people in power locally decided to pocket the money and use it for personal gain rather than rebuilding the city. That is how donating money can be bad. While the act of donation has a good intent, how that donation is used is almost completely out of the donor’s control.",0

He sees as Adam Smith did, no contradiction between his self interest and the public interest. Microsoft created jobs, made people products and shareholders money. That is an ambiguous ‘yes’ and ‘no'. Microsoft and himself did other thinks which were competitive and might even have done other things against the rules, or which were to ‘the letter of the law', but against the spirit of the law. The law doesn't try to be moral, but you are judging him morally. The law requires him to be a legal actor as a director of a company.
2. He is morally confused. He thinks he's selfish because he's getting what he wants. The problem is he doesn't have a cogent theory of values to know his objective interests. But what he doesn't know isnt hurting him, largely because most people are in the same boat as him. Most people will look at him and see ‘net benefactor to society’
3. I think he would see himself as ‘generous’ rather than an altruist. Maybe he sees ‘altruism’ as action one does, rather than as ‘how one thinks'. I think he would step back from saying ‘he's selfish’ because of the negative connotations the Left and Right have pre-loaded that concept with.",0

This implanted certificate could be scanned by a modified smartphone to see if you are vaccinated against COVID-19.

You could say the Aristocrats of today’s age. They have the money and the means to change the direction of the world for the better. 
There long term goals of a better, more sustainable world, are ultimately good. However the means to achieving those goals are in actuality sinister. 
Evil acts have and will be committed in the aim of a positive outcome. 
For example it is the aim of the aristocrats to reduce the worlds population. But the truth of how they plan to do this, will not be spoken of openly. Apart from Bill letting slip that vaccination’s will play some part in this. 
Bill Gates is also one of the biggest advocates of core curriculum throughout the Western countries. Not because he believes in better education for our children . 
But because his software will be bought and used in every school across the Western world. He has made an absolute fortune from taxpayers as we are the ones funding this. 
This type of universal teaching method not only keeps the children stupid. But gives teachers very little ability to teach. As the teachers have to follow what is set out by the state, whether they like it or not. 
The Globalist’s, of which Bill is one, desire a utopian world. A world with a much smaller, easily controlled population. A greener world where the general population are confined to walled cities. Where forests are left to grow. A world where only clean energy exists. 
While these are great aims, it is the willingness to commit evil in the name of good which will ultimately make a failure of there plans.

This is the actress with the feelgood glow like an open fire. In every single article ever written about her, there seems to be a legal requirement to enthuse about what a 'softie' she is in person. Her fellow actors adore Bullock, too. Sylvester Stallone, her co-star in Demolition Man, said: 'She's the girl you wished lived next door.' Hugh Grant, who stars with Bullock in her current movie, Two Weeks Notice, is such best chums with her that (very silly) rumours are flying around that not only are they dating, but that she's secretly had a baby with him. For sheer devilry (as well as publicity purposes), Grant and Bullock have been fanning the flames.

She tends to produce her movies, as well as act in them, and of Two Weeks Notice, she says: 'This is the last time I do producing on such an intense level.' Of her dual acting-producing duties, Bullock adds: 'If you have to have temper tantrums, so long as your torture is about making your work better, I'd say be tortured.'

Indeed, the ludicrousness of the Grant rumours notwithstanding, Bullock once referred to casting agents as 'the perfect dating store', and actually has a bit of form for romancing her leading men.

'There is nothing else in the genre that interests me. I feel like I got everything I wanted in this one.' Does Bullock feel trapped in a box? Her voice comes back sharp. 'What box?' The stereotype kind, I say. Meg Ryan is trapped in the romantic comedy box. She can't get out whatever she does. Bullock pulls a face. 'I think you can totally get out if you don't care about maintaining a lifestyle, or maintaining an image, if you're prepared to take the necessary steps.

In her cuttings from this time, she makes lots of self deprecating references to 'not exactly being a Hollywood bombshell', presenting herself as 'the broad with the tiny chest and big butt'. As Bullock is obviously extremely attractive, this is presumably a get-in-there-before-they-do strategy. After all, Bullock did once suffer the US magazine headline 'The fat girls are bringing it back'. (It should be noted that the article placed her alongside other hideously obese actresses such as Drew Barrymore and Catherine Zeta-Jones.) Bearing this in mind, I wonder if psychological distance was part of the reason Bullock relocated to Texas? Did the emphasis on Body Beautiful make her feel paranoid and insecure?",0

1453099199357231108,"honestly, Sandra Bullock is THAT bitch. easily one of my fav actresses.","Multiple reasons , including:",0
1453099199357231108,"honestly, Sandra Bullock is THAT bitch. easily one of my fav actresses.","1. They are all his height or taller - Cruise is perhaps 5′ 7″ tall. That means that his co-stars have to be his height or much smaller to make their scenes together comfortable for him. The three actors listed above are all at least his height in their bare feet, making them much taller in heels. Not an ideal situation.
2. The three actors above are stars in their own right - Cruise does very few films with established female lead actors (Knight and Day and Vanilla Sky with Cameron Diaz are notable exceptions) and doing so would have risked him not being the center of attention in the film.
3. Jolie’s odd behavior probably worried Cruise and his management - Cruise’s own behavior has been questioned and starring with her in a film might have had the tabloids abuzz for all the wrong reasons.
4. The female actors may not have wanted to share the screen time - Tom Cruise has been an A-list actor for more than three decades. The people coming to the film that he’s in ( Tropic Thunder being an exception) would be there to see HIM, not his co-star. All three female actors have egos at least as large as Cruise’s and this would not be to their liking.
5. Their respective careers were at different places at different times - Roberts was big in the 1990s and early 2000s. Bullock was big from the mid-1990s until the late 2000s and has experienced a resurgence in recent years. Jolie was huge from the late 1990s until around 2010 or so; she’s since cooled down, (with the exception of Maleficent in 2014) due to personal issues and low box office numbers. None of the women were hitting as much as Cruise was (or has been) and thus may not have been as attractive for him to be paired with at the time.
At this point, Tom Cruise would be a poor fit for any project that would star the above actors. His career has changed , as has theirs, and any film that starred them would likely perform poorly in the box office.",0

1453099199357231108,"honestly, Sandra Bullock is THAT bitch. easily one of my fav actresses.","Cruise has been a cash cow for the studios since Top Gun; he hasn’t had a serious flop in thirty years. Some of his movies were financially disappointing, but none have truly tanked. As a result, he comes with a high price tag: I’ve read $20+ million a pic, plus a percentage of the box office. He can get those results without a top female actor; what impetus do the studios have to pay for another big name? There are many talented women in Hollywood who don’t command top dollar. Emily Blunt was excellent in Edge of Tomorrow, and Cameron Diaz held her own in the 2 films she worked with Cruise.",0

Although Roger Ebert gave his performance positive but brief commentary, the problem was that Ebert immediately pointed out that Daniel Day Lewis would have been perfect for the role but turned it down, and he gave more positive attention to Brad Pitt's performance.

The Blind Side -- I'm proud of the fact I was among the early voices predicting this film would not only be nominated for Best Picture and Best Actress, but also that Bullock would win for her performance. 
2. Crash -- While the film is regularly dismissed and criticized as unworthy of winning an Oscar for Best Picture (I don't consider the film as bad as many others do, but I do think there were other films more worthy of the Oscar that year), I feel that several actors gave really strong performances, especially Bullock. 
3. Gravity -- In a restrained role requiring her to emote about the loss of a  child and of her sense of place in the world, while also emoting utter  terror and panic every few minutes as she faces constant disaster,  Bullock's achieves a perfect balance where other actors might have been  either too understated or too melodramatic.
4. Infamous -- In a supporting role as Harper Lee, Bullock really is one of the best parts of this otherwise good-but-not-great film that had the misfortune of coming out the same year as the Oscar-winning Capote. That other film is superior, but Bullock really shows her acting chops here.
5. Speed -- Bullock is at her most charming and purely entertaining in the role that really made her a star, and she manages to be convincing amid ridiculous circumstances and provides an intensity and strong sense of personality despite the fact she spends 99% of the movie driving a bus and not otherwise moving or directing her attention around.",0

That’s not real. It’s fake.” Just a year earlier, Beyoncé went on her own public journey in her album Lemonade, not solely to reckon with her husband’s infidelity, but also to better explore the many dimensions of black womanhood in America. If both musicians’ last solo records announced their newfound interest in more holistic conceptions of masculinity and femininity, then their new music video, “Apeshit,” and its accompanying album, Everything Is Love, show them living out some of these visions of gender together.",0

The other men and women who populate the video also embrace a more mutualistic and fluid approach to gender and power. Men are shown as graceful and valiant, women as both matronly and aggressive—though it is the latter who are depicted in “Apeshit” as the backbone of the Carters’ world.",0

In the now-iconic first glimpse of the couple, the camera glides toward them as they stand in front of the Mona Lisa, each wearing pastel-colored suits with no shirt underneath. The full-body shot calls attention to Beyoncé’s pants and Jay-Z’s elegant attire as the duo re-create the gaze of the woman in the painting. The other main artwork that orients “Apeshit” is a statue of a goddess, the Winged Victory of Samothrace, which appears to symbolize their success—as individuals and as a couple. At another point in the video, female dancers lying on the stairs beneath the duo resemble a foundation, lifting up the Carters’ “empire” with pulse-like movements. At times, the dancers’ formation calls to mind a spine.",0
1453069316803420166,@ELITELAMBS @mimiunleashedd Lol not Beyonce is the lyingest woman in the world lmbao,"In “Apeshit,” classical art helps define the Carters’ vision of how men and women relate to each other. The video subtly contrasts paintings of suffering in male-controlled societies, such as ancient Rome, with peaceful, present-day scenes of couples who are presumably equals. Perhaps the most striking work showing the toll of male violence is The Intervention of the Sabine Women by Jacques-Louis David. It depicts a group of women—who were kidnapped and raped by Roman soldiers in the eighth century B.C.E.—throwing themselves between their captors and the men of their home city in an effort to stop the war. The tableau, a political statement of its own, highlights the breakdown of order that can occur when women aren’t respected. Later in “Apeshit,” a painting of a crying woman clinging from below to a man in anguish (the two trapped in “hell” for adultery) is followed by a contemporary scene of a black man leaning his head peacefully on the chest of a woman as she holds him. When the two are kissing and caressing one another, they’re at eye level; neither is the more dominant.",0
1453069316803420166,@ELITELAMBS @mimiunleashedd Lol not Beyonce is the lyingest woman in the world lmbao,"Similar moments of mutual tenderness show up throughout the Carters’ work, suggesting a personal resonance for the duo. Everything Is Love is sprinkled with lyrics that revel in gentleness, most notably on the song “Summer” when Jay-Z says, “We hugged, made love, on the seats … We watched the sky turn peach … She taste like Corona Light—sweet.” Beyoncé adds that they should “make plans to be in each other’s arms.” These scenes mark a dramatic departure from the more aggressive sexual dynamic of earlier music videos like “Déjà Vu” from Beyoncé’s B’Day in 2006, or “Partition” from her self-titled 2013 album. At this stage in their relationship it’s hard to imagine the couple reducing Beyoncé’s sexuality to an ornamental prop as they have in the past. In Jay-Z’s 2003 “Public Service Announcement,” for instance, he lists his many achievements, including “Got the hottest chick in the game wearing my chain.” And the Jay-Z of today seems to have found a way to gloat about his skills in realms typically associated with women. On “Black Effect” he says, “I like purple and purple rain … These people tryna get me out the paint cus I cook collard greens and yams better than your aunt.”",0
1453069316803420166,@ELITELAMBS @mimiunleashedd Lol not Beyonce is the lyingest woman in the world lmbao,"For all the album’s focus on a softer masculinity, much of Everything Is Love is also driven by Beyoncé casting aside feminine stereotypes. She pushes back against expectations of ladylike behavior throughout the record, talking more than usual about smoking, and repeating Notorious B.I.G.’s classic hip-hop lyric, “If you don’t know, now you know, nigga.” In the “Apeshit” video, Beyoncé sits on the floor in an expensive dress demanding “Put some respect on my check”; later, posing as if for a royal portrait, she raps “Get off my dick,” taking on an assertive role because—as she says on the song “Boss”—there “ain’t nothing to it.” This style of hers isn’t totally new, but Jay-Z had been noticeably absent from some of her most memorable power-grab moments, like her fan-favorite line about Red Lobster on “Formation” or any of the more angry tracks on Lemonade. In the music video for Beyoncé’s 2006 song “Upgrade U,” she dresses up as Jay-Z, lip syncing parts of his verse (while he’s off-camera) with an exhilarating swagger. But when he does finally arrive onscreen, she balances his bravado and reverts to a classically feminine appearance, wearing a sensual white dress.",0
1453069316803420166,@ELITELAMBS @mimiunleashedd Lol not Beyonce is the lyingest woman in the world lmbao,"What’s different in “Apeshit,” then, isn’t that Bey is expressing her independence; it’s that she’s often doing so with Jay-Z in the frame. This shift adds a layer of meaning to the dance she performs before David’s painting of the coronation of Napoleon Bonaparte. The work shows Napoleon crowning his wife Josephine Bonaparte empress of France at his own coronation in 1804 while she kneels before him. (Earlier in the ceremony, he had crowned himself emperor.) Napoleon choosing to have this moment captured by his official painter was, at the time, a way to honor his wife.",0

Instead, Beyoncé uses the painting to, on the one hand, align herself with the empress, proclaiming in her verse (which she delivers in part next to Jay-Z) that she, too, has “expensive fabrics” and “expensive habits.” But she also undercuts the power dynamic of the painting’s ceremony, saying, “He wanna go with me … He wanna be with me”; seconds later she says, “Bought him a jet / Shut down Colette.” (Colette was a high-fashion French retail store.) In a way, the music video is the Carters’ own coronation ceremony, only in their version, no one is on their knees.",0
1453069316803420166,@ELITELAMBS @mimiunleashedd Lol not Beyonce is the lyingest woman in the world lmbao,"In addition to centering women, “Apeshit” recognizes social experiences and struggles particular to men. Jay-Z’s verse and the scenes of young black men kneeling acknowledge the insult that the NFL anthem-protest controversy represents for them, specifically. “I said no to the Super Bowl. You need me. I don’t need you,” Jay-Z raps, as if understanding he’s in a unique position to stand up for the young men and himself. That political comment adds gravity to a related solo shot in the video, when Jay-Z smiles next to a painting, Theodore Gericault’s The Raft of the Medusa, which shows a destroyed raft in choppy waters with a black man guiding it bravely. Instances of male assertiveness in the Carters’ world are decidedly hopeful rather than violent. There’s a quick shot of the raised spears from The Intervention that cuts to a row of young black men pointing to the sky, only their gesture isn’t a destructive one: They look like leaders, not conquerors.",0

The spectacle of making new art using some of the most famous Western art in the world certainly helped. But though the duo had grappled with their evolving conceptions of gender in their own projects, “Apeshit” and Everything Is Love represent the Carters’ first real attempt to stitch those ideas together into a cohesive whole. Until this point, most of their collaborations had credited them by their respective names: as “Jay-Z feat. Beyoncé” or vice versa.

As my colleague Hannah Giorgis pointed out, it can be frustrating to think of Beyoncé working to help Jay-Z discover a healthier masculinity in part because his old self-image may have led him to cheat on her. And they don’t go so far as to reverse gender roles; I’m sure many fans would’ve liked to see an album cover where a man was instead shown tending to a woman’s hair, for instance. More broadly, “Apeshit” will likely continue to spur debate about its other prominent themes, like the pursuit of wealth or the takeover of elite white spaces. Still, the couple’s effort to portray equality is refreshing in light of their past collaborations—a welcome change from their video-girl-meets-powerful-businessman playbook of yesteryear. At least when it comes to their ongoing interrogation of their marriage, the Carters seem to be following the stream of history.",0

1453069316803420166,@ELITELAMBS @mimiunleashedd Lol not Beyonce is the lyingest woman in the world lmbao,"* Pre-existing Legacy: For many Beyonce’s star power has been a long one in the making. Anyone that listened to R&B girl groups in the late 90’s early 00’s probably was also a fan of Destiny’s Child. They had a ton of hits and tons of fans throughout their various band member shuffles. At the forefront, Beyonce was the main staple. Her first independent album helped cement her as a star. Her following albums helped her soar.
 * Jay Z: This one goes without saying. He’s hip hop royalty. Amidst a number of legends that never lived long enough to continue their legacy, Jay Z is a living monument for many. Couple that with the mega star that is Beyonce, add a lot of money, creative projects, business savvy, and mystery (more on that in a sec) and you’ve got yourself a couple of A-Listers.
Dang. They even stand like royalty.",0
1453069316803420166,@ELITELAMBS @mimiunleashedd Lol not Beyonce is the lyingest woman in the world lmbao,"* Private Lifestyle: The Carters are extremely private people. In an age where everything and everyone is accessible, it’s a rare occurrence to find a celebrity that stays relevant and still manages to keep their personal lives private. Beyonce rarely gives interviews and will rarely show up on magazine covers. What makes the Carters more appealing is the mystery that shrouds them when something juicy and scandalous sneaks through the cracks. They never utter a word about any drama. We’ll never know who bit Beyonce in the face, nor will we ever find out why Solange molly-wopped Jay Z in an elevator. Never. If you tell someone to not think of purple ducks, then that’s exactly what they will think of. The Carters are the purple ducks. People eat up the mystery and love to make their own theories.
 * Cultural Connection: this is probably the point that causes the most disagreement, and most likely will be disputed as having little clout. I can’t make anyone get on board, but this is what I know to be true. Black women relate to her. Not all, but many. She is plugged in, there’s no other way to explain it. She gets the struggles at both the macro and the micro levels of black existence for many people. She also takes that experience, turns it on its head and makes amazing visuals to accompany her work. It’s multi layered and symbolic. Black women are a market and those coins count.
 * Work Ethic: She thinks outside the box for her videos and performances. She works hard for the money. Cochella, Super Bowl, world tours, visual albums, everything is planned and executed down to the most minute detail. She must have a hell of a creative team because she delivers for her fans, every time. Say what you want about her, but that lady is a force. Singing at full range, in stadiums, in heels, while doing intricate choreography can’t be easy. I’ve seen footage of her getting her hair caught in a fan, falling down a set of prop stairs and getting her ass inappropriately slapped. She never misses a beat.
 * Professional Relationships: I don’t have a complete leg to stand on here, so I’m gonna go with relative common-sense guessing. The entertainment business is rough. If the big wigs don’t like you, you don’t work. From what I’ve seen, the Carters appear to be charming and likable to their peers. Other celebrities treat them like royalty because see previous points. They like her music because maybe they grew up to Destiny’s Child. Maybe they secretly want to attend an exclusive Carter’s’ party. Maybe they want her for a project. Maybe they just like her. “Shrugs”. What I do know is that the Carters have friends and relationships in high places. That counts for something. She’s also chosen to do projects outside of her range of singing. Films, philanthropic endeavors, and a clothing line have all made appearances in her professional career.
 * Fans: One word: Beyhive. Enough said. Her fanbase is out of this world and extremely loyal. I’m too old, and I don’t know that lady enough to love her unconditionally. However, her true fans do. She touches people and the range of her fans exist outside of just black women. She sells out her shows. She tops charts and makes sure to keep everything she does fresh. She also incorporates enough nostalgia and throwback choreography to keep the fans included. There may even be a peak into her personal life via a performance or video. You may not see her for months on end, but just know, if she whispers the vaguest signal of an appearance, her fans know. And they are willing to pay.
I purposely didn’t mention talent as a marker because it goes without saying that she is talented. In my opinion, entertainment is often consumed based on extreme biases, personal connection, and every once in a while persuasion (i.e marketing or recommendations). I’m of the latter and didn’t become a huge fan until I was an adult and listened to her title album. It spoke to me ya know?",0

I also don’t think that her rise to celebrity is unique to her line of work. There are the Lady Gagas, Taylor Swifts and Chers of the world. Scratch that. There’s only one Cher. Some people just have “it” and I believe she’s one of them. Her career is far from an accident however, and I think being a thick-skinned player has also helped her remain on top.

1453069316803420166,@ELITELAMBS @mimiunleashedd Lol not Beyonce is the lyingest woman in the world lmbao,"A lot of well trained musicians make the choice to sing pop music. Pop music isn’t the most technically challenging music out there, and it doesn’t require the technical ability of, say, an opera singer. It’s a genre of music that doesn’t require a lot vocally out of the singer and it doesn’t really require the singer to be able to read music or understand music theory on a high level, but if you are going to be a professional musician, it is by far the most lucrative genre you can get into. Before I hear the complaining in the comments about being snobby, that isn’t a judgement on whether or not pop music is “less than” genres that require more rigor as far as training—it just is. There are many top tier pop singers who never took formal voice training or any other music training, but they don’t really need to in order to be successful—and we know many of them can barely sing.",0

I know at least two well known current pop musicians that had formal training that made their fame and money by singing pop music: Lady Gaga and Amy Winehouse. Both attended conservatory and studied formally. And a lot of people don’t know this, but Pat Benatar was also trained as an opera singer before she switched to rock. Because pop music is so lucrative and there are far more opportunities to sing that than any other type of music, there are probably a ton of trained musicians who opt to enter that area of the industry that we don’t know about.",0

The last good song of hers I remember is for the 50 shades soundtrack but I loved her earlier stuff. A friend told me what he disliked about her was she doesn’t try to sing her music anymore but tries to be a rapper like Jay Z. Her strength is in that voice and she needs to be using it. Now what I feel uncomfortable about. I appreciate Jay and Bey trying to do good for the black community however sometimes I think they make it worse by courting controversy. This whole Queen Bey thing makes it hard to see Beyoncé as black when she doesn’t live like a normal black person. Yes she is black and she is trying to help but some within that community have taken issue with her involvement. I can’t truly judge someone I don’t know and she may be very sweet though a big spender and full of herself. She has a ton of talent and is beautiful but I don’t see her as I once did. She has been compared to Whitney Houston but I don’t think she holds a candle to her drug abuse or not.,0

He won in the same way some neutral zone trap hockey team bleeds out another team. He clearly built his fighting style around with a calculated strategy of gaming the compubox system so that he gets credit for even the most cursory of punches. And he gets away with it because he always looks as if he can do more. It always feels like there’s some grand fusillade of punches in him that he never ends up having to deploy. He looks like he could unload if he ever felt like it, and so he gets an awful lot of credit for all the things he could do but is too shrewd to risk doing.

Mayweather is, simply, a great fighter. There's one other thing that is undeniable, though: he's also one of the biggest jerks in the entire world. In fact, ""jerk"" doesn't even begin to describe Mayweather's indefensible behavior. It's one thing to be an arrogant, egotistical scumbag. It's another to actually revel in being a villain.

Floyd Mayweather Jr is widely disliked because his actions and personality are offputting to an awful lot people. Let's get the obvious out of the way first - the guy is a convicted domestic abuser who is believed to be guilty of many more offences of this type.

There are a handful of others who have retired undefeated, although the average fan wouldn’t even recognize their names. The one everybody knows of, Rocky Marciano (49–0), isn’t often considered up with the top 10 of all time. Maaaaaybe… he is one of the top 10 heavyweights, though. Also, look at Julio Cesar Chavez; He was 87–0 before he finally got a draw against an opponent. Three fights later he had his first loss. What if he had been saying he was the greatest of all time for 10 years, from about the time he was in his 30–0 days to the time he had his first loss? Would he have a legit argument? Do you discount the later losses because he fought way past his prime? As with Mayweather, Julio Cesar Chavez is one of the greats; I’m just pointing out that he is not THE greatest.",0

Also, like I said, they probably lost a lot of money due to prolonging the match-up. Yet, Floyd only walked away with a split decision. With both boxers in their primes, I would give the clear advantage to De La Hoya.",0
1453043553677070340,"Wait, you mean Floyd Mayweather is a piece of shit? /s","Another fight of note, was the Canelo fight. Canelo was on a path to become an elite in the boxing environment of the time. He was a fan favorite with a style that everybody loved; not to mention his tremendous support in his home country of Mexico - where boxing is only second to soccer. However, he was still wet behind the ears. Okay, that may be an exaggeration, but he wasn’t ready for a fighter like Mayweather. He wasn’t campaigning for a fight with Mayweather. He had barely beaten Lara. Fighters that moved a lot gave Canelo problems. But it was almost like Mayweather hand-picket Canelo, in order to hurry up and get him before it was too late. That was kind of the general consensus. And Canelo’s team, for that matter, couldn’t pass on such a significant payday. They knew they had to accept the challenge, regardless of their lack of preparedness. Canelo chased Mayweather around the whole fight, even getting visibly upset that he couldn’t catch him, or that Mayweather wouldn’t stand and trade. Meanwhile, Mayweather employed the technique that he had become famous for, a phenomenal defense using head movement, shoulder rolls, and foot movement. Stay away, hit but don’t be hit. Laser accurate jabs. Jumping in and out of punching range. Not sure how Mayweather only won by majority decision, but it seemed to be a dominant performance. Yet, people complained about this fight, too. Mostly casual fans. However, he did in fact seem to fight much more cautious than with most opponents.",0
1453043553677070340,"Wait, you mean Floyd Mayweather is a piece of shit? /s","The bookends to this fight were the Robert Guerrero and Marcos Maidana fights (coming out of retirement for the latter). Mayweather appears to have employed a different style during these matches. For the Robert Guerrero fight, in particular, he stood in the pocket and traded more, especially during the first few rounds. For one, I don’t think Floyd respected his power at the weight they fought at (Guerrero had gone up), and for two, he was eager to make an entertaining fight, given the criticism he had so often been victim of. (By the way, I think it was shown in other Guerrero fights that he had no power at Welterweight). Maidana was an exception because he put constant pressure on Mayweather, not allowing him to move much, or escape, and thus neutralizing some of his defensive abilities. It was another majority decision, but not a very impressive win.",0

He knew Canelo would take life changing money and Floyd assured himself the absolute lowest risk, instead of fighting at a higher weight to see if he was better than Canelo at his best, and not practically dying of dehydration and sick from trying to rehydrate.

Like a philanthropist, off-script she’ll demand the show to give this person lots and lots of expensive prizes, tickets to the show, 50″ flat screen TVs, the lot. I can see her soaking in that applause, basking in it, getting off on the audiable approval of the audience. Her ego is presumably at God level.

1453034806242160648,the hate i have for ellen degeneres is crazy,"Little things I notice when I want to read people. Her tone of voice and intonation when she talks to celebrity guests on her show comes across as positive and joyful, higher pitches and a range of tone to imply she's actively listening and showing interest and approval of the guest’s replies. However I've noticed a slight change of that when she addresses the backstage staff or whoever Co ordinates the sound, queues the videos etc. For example when Ellen visited the winner/fan of the shows’ house, at first the guest was surprised and shocked, but very excited and happy to meet Ellen, and she reciprocated the greeting. She listened and joked with her, and proceeded to showcase allll the fantastic and expensive gifts whilst being filmed on the live feed on the show.",0
1453034806242160648,the hate i have for ellen degeneres is crazy,"Now, when the woman was excitedly unwrapping the gifts, Ellen made a big deal about how great and high quality the “Ellen” show themed merch was, almost as if it was a teleshopping ad, accentuating how good value and high quality and aesthetic the gifts were, raising her tone of voice at the end of each remark to reassure the woman agrees with her on how lucky she was to have received these wonderful, jealous-evoking items, really, what a lucky girl. At one point she asked the camera man to get a closer look at the sheer greatness of the gifts, and that's when I noticed her voice. For a very brief moment as she said “c’mon over here let's get a closer look here, c’mon get a little closer so we can really see them, right up here” or to that extent, her voice became flat and demanding, with a coldness to it. I think that was the real Ellen that slipped through the cracks momentarily.",0

She promotes her twitter page named, “Ellen DeGeneres” (of course) on her show, and I've seen her ask her guests if they follow her twitter account. She makes sure to mask this in lighthearted comedy, but it is no joke. Social media and vanity go hand in hand, where she can soak up the glory of her insatiable thirst for fame, power, attention and admiration.

 * Egotistical, self important/superiority complex

 * Craves the spotlight, attention
**I'm sure if you replace Ellen DeGeneres with Donald Trump, you'll find several similarities. The only difference is that Donald Trump does not need to hide behind a generous and giving persona; he doesn't need to. He's got all the power. An interesting analogy, but I digress.",0

Anyone who comes to her show only worships her and she just seems to be really full of herself now. I don’t enjoy that as much, so for those reasons, I do find her over-rated. She is sometimes funny and I appreciate what she does for others (despite her partnership with awful corporations like Walmart), but some humility and less product selling would go a long way in making the show less tiresome to watch.

1453034806242160648,the hate i have for ellen degeneres is crazy,"1. None of her past lovers or “flings"" have publicly discussed their relationships favorably - If DeGeneres was “cool"", she would have numerous exes gushing about that. They aren't.
2. She has her employees sign nondisclosure agreements - While this is common in the entertainment industry, it's also an indication that there are aspects of the celebrity's personality that they want,or need, to be hidden from the general public. Although DeGeneres’ NDAs aren't as stringent as Oprah Winfrey's, they are harsh enough to make discussing her by ex-employees very expensive for those individuals.
3. Her fellow comedians are oddly silent about her - If Ellen DeGeneres was deemed to be “cool"" everyone would want her to be in their projects, on their podcasts, or on their series if they have one. They don't do that with Ellen.
4. The media doesn't trumpet her “coolness” - If DeGeneres was indeed “cool"" the media would shout that out from the rooftops. They don't, and in fact, they are satisfied with canned interviews from DeGeneres which almost never stray into controversial areas.
DeGeneres is a 62 year old who has a raft of personal issues and is apparently not the same as she presents herself as being on air. If someone is looking for “cool"", they should probably look elsewhere.",0
1453034806242160648,the hate i have for ellen degeneres is crazy,Here is my psychoanalysis of Ellen DeGeneres.,0
1453034806242160648,the hate i have for ellen degeneres is crazy,"***Please keep in mind: People who suffer from NPD, ASPD/psychopathy are not predetermined to be or are inherently evil and/or abusive. That depends on the person's morals and intentions. People with NPD are not automatically assholes, they have the tools to be an asshole, but it's their choice to use those tools to be an asshole. Ellen DeGeneres seems to be using those tools.",0
1453034806242160648,the hate i have for ellen degeneres is crazy,"I know people like to call everybody who acts like an a** a narcissist these days, but I strongly suspect Ellen DeGeneres has a case of NPD or narcissism to a certain extent. When I watch her show she comes across as very charming, extremely confident and extroverted. She treats her celebrity guests with respect and prestige but I can see that she can't wait until they finish talking so that the audience will focus their attention on her again. She cannot wait to start talking again.",0
1453034806242160648,the hate i have for ellen degeneres is crazy,"She is absolutely dripping in superficial charm and glibness it's sickening. She smiles with her mouth not her eyes, that analytic, predatory stare that I notice in alot of severely narcissistic and psychopathic individuals.",0
1453034806242160648,the hate i have for ellen degeneres is crazy,"I witness her overt over the top demonstrations of generosity she displays when an audience member is brought onto the stage or a fan of the show is visited. Like a philanthropist, off-script she’ll demand the show to give this person lots and lots of expensive prizes, tickets to the show, 50″ flat screen TVs, the lot. I can see her soaking in that applause, basking in it, getting off on the audiable approval of the audience. Her ego is presumably at God level. And I presume from my analysis and from what I've heard, off camera she treats her staff, assistants, security and people her junior like the dirt off the bottom of her shoe.",0
1453034806242160648,the hate i have for ellen degeneres is crazy,"Little things I notice when I want to read people. Her tone of voice and intonation when she talks to celebrity guests on her show comes across as positive and joyful, higher pitches and a range of tone to imply she's actively listening and showing interest and approval of the guest’s replies. However I've noticed a slight change of that when she addresses the backstage staff or whoever Co ordinates the sound, queues the videos etc. For example when Ellen visited the winner/fan of the shows’ house, at first the guest was surprised and shocked, but very excited and happy to meet Ellen, and she reciprocated the greeting. She listened and joked with her, and proceeded to showcase allll the fantastic and expensive gifts whilst being filmed on the live feed on the show.",0
1453034806242160648,the hate i have for ellen degeneres is crazy,"Now, when the woman was excitedly unwrapping the gifts, Ellen made a big deal about how great and high quality the “Ellen” show themed merch was, almost as if it was a teleshopping ad, accentuating how good value and high quality and aesthetic the gifts were, raising her tone of voice at the end of each remark to reassure the woman agrees with her on how lucky she was to have received these wonderful, jealous-evoking items, really, what a lucky girl. At one point she asked the camera man to get a closer look at the sheer greatness of the gifts, and that's when I noticed her voice. For a very brief moment as she said “c’mon over here let's get a closer look here, c’mon get a little closer so we can really see them, right up here” or to that extent, her voice became flat and demanding, with a coldness to it. I think that was the real Ellen that slipped through the cracks momentarily.",0
1453034806242160648,the hate i have for ellen degeneres is crazy,"I also notice that she often (I'm not sure if she does this every episode but I've seen clips on YouTube and on some episodes) that she is an avid fan and frequent (bit of an understatement) user of social media. She promotes her twitter page named, “Ellen DeGeneres” (of course) on her show, and I've seen her ask her guests if they follow her twitter account. She makes sure to mask this in lighthearted comedy, but it is no joke. Social media and vanity go hand in hand, where she can soak up the glory of her insatiable thirst for fame, power, attention and admiration. When it comes to celebrity culture, DeGeneres is like a moth to a flame.",0
1453034806242160648,the hate i have for ellen degeneres is crazy,"So in my psychoanalysis of Ellen DeGeneres, looking at her real, authentic self behind the carefully cultivated and maintained mask of the friendly, cheerful, fun loving, kind and entertaining TV host I can deduce that she exhibits high levels of narcissism. In summary she is:",0
1453034806242160648,the hate i have for ellen degeneres is crazy,"* Superficially charming/glib
 * Egotistical, self important/superiority complex
 * Bossy/arrogant
 * Neurotic and controlling
 * Showy, braggy, shows magnificent acts of kindness and generosity in front of others ie. Philanthropic to serve her own image
 * Cold, callous, calculated, unemphethic, dismissive, patronising
 * Has cultivated a TV persona and uses it to self serve unrelated and outside the boundaries that benefit the show
 * Craves the spotlight, attention
**I'm sure if you replace Ellen DeGeneres with Donald Trump, you'll find several similarities. The only difference is that Donald Trump does not need to hide behind a generous and giving persona; he doesn't need to. He's got all the power. An interesting analogy, but I digress.",0

1453034806242160648,the hate i have for ellen degeneres is crazy,Question: What do people see in Ellen DeGeneres? Is there some reason she is famous that I'm missing?,0
1453034806242160648,the hate i have for ellen degeneres is crazy,Some thoughts:,0
1453034806242160648,the hate i have for ellen degeneres is crazy,"2. She’s gay, but not “militantly so.” - Everybody knows that Ellen DeGeneres is gay…but her public image is carefully crafted to keep that as just another part of her personality. Her wife doesn’t appear very often on the program, she doesn’t use her talk show as a platform for LGBTQ issues, she avoids “militantly gay” guests and she keeps things as “straight” as she possibly can. Only true homophobes could find anything about her program which promotes being gay. In fact, if she had a Steadman Graham in the background, you wouldn’t know that she was a lesbian.",0
1453034806242160648,the hate i have for ellen degeneres is crazy,"4. Her personal life is pretty undercover - Again, her wife doesn’t appear on the show very often. Her relationship with her mother has to be pretty strained (DeGeneres by her own admission had a hard time coming out to her which doesn’t indicate much closeness) and she doesn’t have any children, neither of which are spoken about on the show. While her real estate speculation makes news, her personal affairs rarely do. The public can certainly appreciate a celebrity who keeps their private matters private and Ms. DeGeneres certainly does do that.
5. She keeps her harder edges well-hidden - If you watch DeGeneres’ early standup (and read a recent interview about her) it’s pretty clear that she isn’t all “sweetness and light.” The fact that she’s managed to keep people from going back too far into her past and pulling out the unpleasant things (or getting her to be too unpleasant now) is a testament to both her self-control and her image-managing abilities. While there are occasionally cracks in the facade (Watch how Ellen acts on her shopping trips and how she acts when things are going a little rough with a guest) for the most part, Ellen DeGeneres’ rough parts are kept well-hidden.",0
1453034806242160648,the hate i have for ellen degeneres is crazy,"1. She’s funny, without being threatening - Ellen’s humor is the bland and largely inoffensive kind that attracts the middle class viewers her program is seeking. She isn’t “dirty” and, as a female comedian, her humor doesn’t “male bash” which doesn’t make her a threat some people’s fragile egos.",1
1453034806242160648,the hate i have for ellen degeneres is crazy,"3. Her timing was excellent - Hollywood kept trying to create a “White Oprah Winfrey” to compete with the real one. The only one who made the “cut” was DeGeneres. She was the right person, at the right time, with the right blend of blandness and humor to make her appealing to mass audiences. A few years earlier or later, she wouldn’t have made it. Her timing was just right and a lot of people find that to be appealing.",1
1453034806242160648,the hate i have for ellen degeneres is crazy,"Soooo…while I don’t know why YOU don’t like her, questioner, I can tell you that her mild humor, bland inoffensiveness, her timing and her ability to keep her personal life and demons under wraps are the major reasons that she’s been a success.",1

My problem is I often find Mr. Hannity’s style very judgmental, harsh (even cruel) and unnecessarily discourteous towards those with whom he disagrees, while being effusive and eternally forgiving to Republicans. And while he is eager to defend Republicans, he reserves his constant scorn for Democrats, “the left,” and former president Obama. (And yet, to be fair, despite his intense dislike of Mr. Obama, Sean Hannity did in fact praise the former president for being a good father to his kids. We can analyze that and say, okay he did it because in his stereotypical world, black men are not good fathers and thus Barack Obama is the exception. But I choose to cut him some slack and say that he actually was paying Mr. Obama a sincere compliment… after which he returned to trashing the former president.)

Iranian nationalists condemned his U.S. supported regime and his “westernizing” of Iran. During rioting in 1963, the Shah cracked down, suppressing his opposition. Among those arrested and exiled was a popular religious nationalist and bitter foe of the United States, the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.",0

Because of this, foreign affairs do not typically figure prominently in American electoral politics except when Americans are in danger for one reason or another. In the late 1970s, the American public had little knowledge of Iran, the shah, Islam, or terrorism. That would all change on November 4, 1979, when radical Iranian students took over the U.S. embassy in Tehran and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days. The Iranian revolution and the hostage crisis would take down President Jimmy Carter and make Americans aware of a part of the world and the roiling tensions within it that are still part of our politics today.",0

The turmoil in Iran and the fall of the shah had, frankly, very little impact on American politics. In fact, what I remember from that period of time is the Jules Feiffer cartoon with a series of men in Middle Eastern dress lined up. And the gist of the cartoon was: Who knows the difference? Shiites, Sunnis, the differences between them, what their enmity meant to the region: Most Americans remained unaware of the religious and political nuances of the region.",0

Carter immediately suspended foreign travel and political campaigning to focus on the crisis. But there was no diplomatic solution to be had. And what came to be known as “the Rose Garden strategy” (referring to the White House Rose Garden) turned into a trap for the president. Stu Eizenstat, one of Carter’s top aides and the author of the book “President Carter: The White House Years,” writes that the Rose Garden strategy “had another unintended and deeply pervasive effect. It totally personalized the crisis in the American media by focusing the responsibility on the Oval Office and showing the terrorists they could put the American presidency itself into dysfunction.”",0

But given that it was Carter who had invited the shah into the United States, the students who were in control were not inclined to let him off the hook. Furthermore, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini was calling the shots, and he opposed any early settlement. So month after month, as Carter was trapped in the White House, negotiations went nowhere. This is why, in the spring, he decided to mount a military rescue of the hostages.",0

The phone at my house rang early in the morning on April 25, 1980. It was Rick Hernandez, one of the president’s senior political aides, who had heard about the aborted mission and subsequent disaster. He opened the conversation with, “We just lost the election.” I was confused. It was the middle of the night, and, moreover, Carter had just beaten Kennedy in a string of southern primaries and had tied him in the Pennsylvania primary. Rick proceeded to describe, in fairly accurate terms, the debacle in the desert.",0

To put these events in context, it is also important to remember that Americans had been enchanted with the story of the Israeli raid on Entebbe in 1976. This is one of the first special operations missions that burst into the public consciousness. The dramatic and stunning Israeli rescue of hostages who had been taken by Palestinians in Uganda captured the public imagination. Four years later, the United States tried its own daring rescue and fell flat on its face. That was devastating to Carter. And I believe to this day that my friend Rick Hernandez was right. Carter lost the election that night.",0

His approval ratings were in the toilet. And the challenge from Kennedy, a lion of the Democratic Party, was the toughest nomination challenge any incumbent Democrat had had in many years. Although Carter won the Democratic nomination, he lost all but six states plus the District of Columbia to Ronald Reagan in November. By then, the Iranian students had played out their hand. They had held the hostages for longer than anyone (including themselves) had expected. The hostages were released on January 20, 1981 — the day Ronald Reagan was inaugurated.",0

It should be noted that at the time of the attempted hostage rescue mission in 1980, there was no unified Special Operations Command in the U.S. military to coordinate the various commands and agencies involved in special operations warfare. In fact, these elements of U.S. military power were, after the wind-down of the Vietnam War, generally underfunded and mistrusted within the military establishment.",0

Carter lost the election resoundingly to Ronald Reagan. And in 1985, the Senate began to look at a major military reform bill. Reformers faced intense opposition within the military, particularly from the Navy, and they also faced opposition from Reagan’s secretary of defense. But it was clear that the failure of Operation Eagle Claw, in addition to Vietnam and several other smaller failures, contributed to a point in history where people said, it is time to do something with the United States military when the greatest power in the world cannot manage to rescue its own people.",0

Starting with the Iranian revolution and the hostage crisis and continuing through the 9/11 attacks, a generation of Americans came to view the Islamic world with great distrust. (And they are still not clear about the differences between Sunnis and Shiites.) Some U.S. presidents have tried to soothe this fear; for instance, President George W. Bush visited a mosque right after 9/11. President Donald Trump, on the other hand, has gone in the opposite direction, engaging in incendiary rhetoric about radical Islam. The hostage crisis and subsequent acts of terrorism in the name of Islam created a powerful strain of public opinion that continues to play a role in American life and politics.

That arrived with the battle over the Tellico Dam [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tellico_Dam ], a dam that the Tennessee Valley Authority wanted to build to divert water from one river into another to supplement a hydropower dam. It was actually 90% complete in 1969 when the National Environmental Policy Act was passed, which required projects like this so carry out an environmental impact study. The TVA claimed it was exempt from the NEPA, but a court disagreed and work was held up for several years, until it ran foul of the Endangered Species Act of 1973. To cut a long story short, the Supreme Court found against the TVA and ordered work stopped. Meanwhile, an economic study had found that the dam, once completed, wouldn’t even generate enough revenue to repay the cost of completing it. It looked doomed. But then on a quiet night in 1979 James Duncan, a Congressman whose district covered the dam, walked into Congress and presented an amendment to the appropriations bill. Tom Bevill and John Myers, both members of the appropriations committee, rose to second the amendment and it was adopted by voice vote in a nearly deserted chamber where nobody except the three sponsors even knew what the amendment did. It exempted the Tellico Dam from all laws. The Supreme Court finding was of null effect. Congress then forced Carter to sign it by holding his feet to the fire over the Panama Canal Treaty that he was negotiating at the time. Any hope of his reelection was dead. His own party wouldn’t support him.",0

After a massacre of foreigners (including Americans) at Jaffa (now Tel Aviv, Israel) in January 1851, a demonstration by the US Naval Fleet “Mediterranean Squadron” was ordered along the Levant coast.

1.  It's amazing to me that Cheney would have the chutzpah to claim that Obama has made us less safe with Iraq.  Let's be clear:  there was no clear justification for invading Iraq, no WMDs and other than Saddam attempting to assassinate George HW Bush in Kuwait after he'd left the WH, Iraq was NO THREAT to the US prior to the invasion.  To argue it was about overthrowing Saddam Hussein is weak--he was a very bad man but the world is full of very bad men and abusive dictators...so we're going to invade Syria, North Korea, Uzbekistan, Russia, Iran, Central African Republic, Belarus, Egypt, Zimbabwe, and Sudan too?  What the invasion of Iraq did was destroy it as a country 'Iraq Is Finished' [ http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/04/iraq-is-finished-isis-origin/389901/ ]  and also create the environment for a Pan-al-Qaeda (i.e.: an al-Qaeda that transcends countries and is more than just a terrorist group but a movement around the world) and then eventually ISIS/Daesh  Iraq War Created Isis, Concedes David Miliband [ http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/iraq-war-created-isis-concedes-david-miliband-1460557 ]  Leith, Cheney, and Wolfowitz (who were the primary architects of the Iraq invasion) have a lot to answer for.  Remember, it was Cheney who said that the numbers of troops required was overestimated, that we would be welcomed as liberators, that it would be a short war, that Iraq would become a force for democracy in the Middle East and Arab States, that oil would pay for the costs of the invasion.  It was the Bush administration that saw al-Maliki assume power in Iraq.  Under al-Maliki, Iraq refused to approve a SOFA (Status of Forces Agreement) that provided immunity for US troops--Iraq wanted to be able to try American troops in Iraqi courts:  Iraq’s Government, Not Obama, Called Time on the U.S. Troop Presence | TIME.com [ http://world.time.com/2011/10/21/iraq-not-obama-called-time-on-the-u-s-troop-presence/ ]  And al-Maliki helped feed the conditions that led to Daesh/ISIS.  al-Maliki promoted a government that supported only the Shia and treated the Sunni as outcasts.  So now we see former insurgents who were previously Sunni officers under Saddam advising or leading ISIS  Saddam's Ex-Officer: We've Played Key Role In Helping Militants [ http://www.npr.org/blogs/parallels/2014/06/19/323691052/saddams-ex-officer-weve-played-key-role-in-helping-militants ]  and Iraqi military units made up of Sunnis refusing to fight--they desert in-mass.  Cheney is one of the key figures in taking an international irritant (Iraq) and turning it into a destabilizing conflict across the Middle East that is likely to be a base for extremist groups that seek to strike out against the US.  Cheney has no credibility talking about Iraq--almost every single pronouncement he's made about Iraq was not only wrong but almost the polar opposite of reality or how it played out.",0

The ""sweet spot"" was the first year after our invasion...at that point the Taliban was on the run, Iran was unsure of what to do, the war lords were intimidated...if there was a chance to ""win"" that war, that was the time period.  Instead, the Administration's focus turned to Iraq.  All of the bandwidth, the priorities focused on Iraq.  Key special ops units got pulled out of Afghanistan.  There was no really strategy in Afghanistan b/c the US shifted focus to Iraq:  The New York Times [ http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/12/world/asia/12afghan.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0 ].  Real simply--no foreign power has every dominated Afghanistan and controlled that country.  IF it was going to happen, it needed to happen in the first two years.  Instead, we let a corrupt Karzai take charge, we empowered the war loads, didn't track down UBL and allowed the Taliban to reconstitute itself, had no meaningful national-building strategy (or even a strategy for the country).  We just dumped some troops in there with no clear mission, used a lot of artillery and airstrikes (to makeup for manpower shortages caused by Iraq) and gave the Taliban a chance to recover.  Here's a small detail that Cheney doesn't talk about when he tries to claim that Obama has been soft on Afghanistan:  the US launched more drone attacks in just one month (and averages more per month from 2008-2012) in Pakistan than the Bush administration launched in total for the entire two terms.  And it's not just drone attacks either--same with cross-border missions.  The Bush Administration didn't do anything about the Afghan-Pakistani border even though most of the Taliban hail from Pakistan and all of them cross over the border to train, rest, and refit.",0

--Cheney has already repeatedly criticized both of them publicly.  So by saying either would be better than Obama he's not praising any of them, he's trying to say that he thinks Obama is the worst of the worst.
--I don't think HRC or Carter would have done as well as Obama with the economic meltdown of 2007-8. 
--Time will tell on foreign policy.  HRC was SecState for Obama's administration so it's really hard to argue that foreign policy would have been substantially different under her (especially with regard to Afghanistan and Iraq).  The Russian invasion of Afghanistan happened on Jimmy Carter's term so I suspect he would have been very eager to get out of Afghanistan were he elected President in 2008.",0

She started with the blunt racial slurs of her childhood, which turned, as she grew, into the patronising queries and assumptions favoured by adults who think themselves liberal. A perfect example was the teacher who told her to fill in “white” on a census because “that’s how you look, Meghan”. Intended as a compliment, no doubt. In the essay, she also discussed the institutional racism exposed by the police shootings in Ferguson and Baltimore. She recalled the flurry of racist tweets set off when Wendell Pierce was cast as her African American father on Suits: “Ew, she’s black? I used to think she was hot.” Then, having described both her struggles with, and her pride in, being biracial, she ended the essay with a tribute to her black ancestry.",0

1453021298062499844,"...so surprised to find he looks like a middle-aged white thumb-head...and thinks Meghan Markle is ""tawdry"" (his exact words)","1. Meghan lied about paying for her own college.
2. Meghan lied about not knowing who Prince Harry or the Royal Family were.
3. Meghan lied about her father being a bad dad, even though her entire life was filled with nothing but posts about what a great father he was and how much she loved him. Meghans own words contradict everything she has to say about her father. Why does Meg want to paint her father as a monster now? Because he called her out on her bullshit, when she lied about paying for her college, and “not having a family”.
4. Meghan lied about the Royal Family “being the famliy she never had”. She tried to victimize her self, when her own posts and friends said she had a great childhood and great relationship with her dad.
5. Meghan lies about being racially bullied by the British. I have followed Meghan for 2 years and not ONCE have I EVER seen a racist comment about her. Are some of them not nice? Yes, but unkind comments are not racist ones. She is pulling the race card for victim points.
6. Meghan lied about when she met Prince Harry. Her original date for meeting him, which she later retracted, was during the same time she was dating her Canadian boyfriend. The crazy “coincidence” is that she actually ran into Prince Harry around the same time as the original date when they attended the same conference/gathering together. She accidentally let it slip that they started their relationship DURING the time she was still dating someone.
7. She lied about “working her way” to her career. Turns out, she got most her parts from her husband giving her roles, or getting her connections. She diddnt break into the industry because of her talent, she broke in because of who she was married to. So much for an “independent feminist.”
8. She lies to people about “fighting for equality”. She spent $1 million on designer clothes this year, flies private jets, has half a million in jewelry, and lived in a Palace. Talk about hypocritical and deluded.
Now lets start with Prince Harry.",0

2. He lies about “fighting against unconscious racial bias”. Yeah, Harry most British people manage not to wear Nazi uniforms and make racial slurs, yet YOUR the one to lecture us on racial bias?
3. He lied about how often he takes private jets. He said he “flew commercial” most of the time, and rarely used private, but his record shows he uses private 60% of the time.
4. He lies about wanting privacy. He yells at reporters and screams from privacy but decided to have one of the most viewed weddings of all time, posts on IG everyday, makes attention grabbing decrees on climate change, race and feminism, and openly hangs out with Beyonce, Ellen DeGeneres, Elton John and David Beckham. He wants privacy SO MUCH that hes decided to have his own TV show with Oprah.
5. He lied about “always putting the military first”. He skipped a dead soldiers memorial to hang out with Beyonce.
6. Harry lectures people about mental health….then enables his wife to abandon her dying father. At one point her Dad had 2 heart attacks and could have been days away from dying. Instead of encouraging his wife to reach out to what could have been her dads last few days, they completley ignore him. Guess what is NOT GOOD for someones mental health Harry? Its having family members abandon you during times of great need.
7. Harry likes to ask people to donate to his charity “The Sussex Foundation”…but lies about the fact its not a charity, its a business scheme to make he and Meghan money. Oh you diddnt know? Both Meghan and Harry, two of some of the richest people in the world, all get a precent of the money you donate to “help the poor”. So that money that Disney donated to them?

1453021298062499844,"...so surprised to find he looks like a middle-aged white thumb-head...and thinks Meghan Markle is ""tawdry"" (his exact words)","* History of being difficult and diva like - she has no career to back that type of behavior up, so any director will nope that
 * She's almost 40 years old. That's the age where you're considered old in Hollywood
 * She doesn't have an attractive body - she's shaped like a block, no waist, too skinny legs, flat breasts - so most clothing doesn't look good on her. It's always bunched at the waist, emphasizes how wide she is. So that leaves out any type of ‘influencer’ position
 * She has only acted in bit parts, walk on and supporting roles, with the exception of the soft porn she was in - she didn't have a leading role, but she appeared a lot.
 * All the roles she's had have been call girl, slutty teen, office vixen roles. Those are offered to young women of which there are a dime a dozen in Hollywood.
 * She's pushy and doesn't take direction well. Look at the mess she made of the most visible role she's ever had. The BRF put her through 6 months of intensive etiquette training on all things British & Royal Family by the most knowledgeable and professional people in world. That's far more than Hollywood actors get to prepare for a role. But she couldn't follow direction. They would even brief her before every event, going over manners, etiquette & tradition where to stand, sit, walk, etc. But she'd come striding in, sashaying, head bobbing around for the cameras. She'd push in front of her boyfriend, then husband during state events to shake hands when they were there to meet HIM. She would interrupt conversations shove helpers out of the way, lose her temper, throw tantrums making them late. Even at their last appearance, when they were advised what to do, she threw a tantrum because they were told they would not be processing with the senior Royals. This forced the future king & queen to have to bow out of the procession to stop the tantrum & not make people wait. You can see how angry everyone is in the videos. Then, when it was time to process out, instead of going to the end of the aisle, she pushed through chairs to get in front of Edward & Sophie when they had already stepped back to allow Harry & M to go in front of them. She would have inappropriate rictus-like grins plastered to her face at all times - even solemn occasions. It made her look crazy.
 * She's too self aware and needs all attention on her. This means she'll expect to be handed lead roles in everything she does. And if someone unfortunately casts her in a supporting role, she's going to do whatever necessary to get the attention back on her.
 * She has Bitter Actor Syndrome. She blames her lack of roles, not on the possibility that maybe she's just not good enough, but instead on her race. Even though she marketed herself as Caucasian on her resume, etc. and looks Caucasian, she claims she wasn't booked because she is biracial. She's cosigning on the struggles black people actually go through-they can't hide being black - as an excuse instead of looking inward at herself. Then she blamed her failure to adapt first on ignorance of what she was agreeing to (exactly why everyone said to wait) and then that the press was mean & she didn't know they'd be mean because “we don't have tabloids in the US”. Come on. Prince Charles is a man who, after the death of his former wife & his children's mother and his marriage to Camilla, suffered more adverse publicity than any member of the Royal Family in modern times. Yet he didn’t run away. He didn’t hide. He didn’t criticise. He didn’t ban anybody from the Rota. Charles and Camilla faced up to the criticism, got on with it and showed they were two people who want to do their duty for their country. No matter what bad publicity they have had, they have always looked straight down the camera and won over their critics.
 * Too much baggage. She has notoriety but not the kind people who are trying to make TV & movies want. She is known for making rash decisions then bailing on them when they get too challenging. She has A LOT of negative attention due to the way she treated her father, her staff, the Queen's staff, Catherine's staff, tone deaf Instagram posts during a crisis, being dishonest & deceptive, being hypocritical, race baiting and the worst, using African children as a backdrop to complain about your over-privileged life which many found very offensive. Then encouraging her husband to invoke his own mother’s tragic death to demand the press stop calling out his hypocritical wife is downright disgusting. Whether you agree or not, people (which who matter the most when it comes to fame) believe her to be conniving. Many British monarchists/Royalists (and I'd suspect many who were neutral about the Royals) feel that she took away a beloved citizen, and disrespected their culture. No marriage will survive when one spouse forces the other to give up everything they've ever known. That's really difficult when you're not from a wealthy, famous family, used to privilege your entire life. Just becoming a commoner is going to be difficult for him. But the cultural change (especially considering he planted himself in the most vile, fake, ruthless culture in the entire country) is going to be really, really hard. Then add on his growing unpopularity, after a lifetime of being a beloved prince & figure in a small pond and placing yourself as a former prince with a difficult wife in a BIG pond…
 * she's terrible at marketing herself and they are afraid of her going rogue. They spend millions of dollars producing movies and a huge part of earning it back is marketing the movie. They have a certain image they want to project. But if you have an actor in that film who goes out and creates controversy, especially if it's out of line with the image they want to portray, that can ruin the entire project. That's not fair to all of the other people who played a part in the film, filmmaking is a team effort.
 * Because she's not a good actress. She's very basic. She imitates what she thinks success is but it just makes her look and behave like everyone else. Nothing about her is unique or interesting. She's pretty due to plastic surgery fake teeth, fake eye lashes, fake hair, botox, lip injections. But she looks just like all the other women who have done the exact same thing. Soon all Hollywood women look the same, now even young Instagram women are doing it: puffy cheeks, eyebrows frozen in place, overly plump lips with the top lip going trout-like, too much bronzer, too much highlighter.
 * She is unlikable. This is why she had no friends at her 2nd known marriage. No family. Has no friends from youth.
More importantly, she's already on the radar of the Hollywood elite. But not in a way that you want to be.",0

1453021298062499844,"...so surprised to find he looks like a middle-aged white thumb-head...and thinks Meghan Markle is ""tawdry"" (his exact words)","I’d love to answer this because I tried to find scenes with her in Suits. I fast forwarded through the first several seasons and realized that she was a regular “extra” on the show. Walking down hallways following the lead actors, sitting in on meetings taking notes. I got bored before finding the more juicy scenes of her with little clothes on. She doesnt have any acting chops at all. Given how well she’s done getting the most out of her father, then her husband, several female friends and the BRF etc I figured she would be natural as an actress. But she’s not, at all. Because in order to be a good actor, one must be able to EMPATHIZE with the character, to FEEL and THINK and EMOTE like the character. And to RELATE to the nuances of the other characters. And as a narcissist/sociopath, she is fundamentally unable to do that, in real life nor on film. She cannot act well because she actually cannot put herself inside the soul of another person, real or īmaginary. That explains why she is always HERSELF regardless of being in a film role or being interviewed by OW. What she says may be total BS, but her mannerism, tone, voice, expression are always the same. Her eyes look scary dead, there is no warmth or feeling in her wyes despite that gorgeous orthodontic veneered smile. Even her Disney voiceover was poor because it was just herself reading a script—no feeling even for elephants! I would think that the A-listers instantly see that she’s no actress, just a diva determined to be a global influencer. This explains why she’s never gotten a part despite many roles these days for mixed race women of all types. Observing her antics made me actually have a higher level of respect for real accomplished actors as I now realize it takes an awful lot of mental and emotional work to successfully portray a character.",0

So here it is: Ive watched her in Suits, as well as a few other things. And honestly, there is a reason why she was mostly unemployed for her acting career and had few roles. She only really ever had ONE role, and it was a minor character in a minor TV show, and I can see why. Its not that she has ZERO ability, she was never terrible and had a few good moments, the problem is that she was mediocre, at times downright unconvincing, or too overdone. She overacts a lot, seems one-dimensional, does not display great range, and waaay over does her facial expressions, to the point were a few times, I genuinely tried not to laugh. In my personal opinion, she does not have the hallmark traits of a “good actor” and would probably never have made it to the big leagues on ability alone. To summarize, while I did not find her to be terrible, I think it would be a lie to call her very talented. My personal opinion was just that she was “okay”.",0

1453016746911100935,Floyd Mayweather is an abusive dick. https://t.co/f0khpbPXsG,"We are literally just days away from one of the biggest events in sports history when Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao fight Saturday night at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. There are media outlets covering boxing and writing stories that have never covered the sport before. Some stories have done the sport and this fight justice, while others on the other hand should be ashamed of themselves. Unfortunately I recently dealt with the latter when I made the mistake of hopping on to the four letter networks newly awful redesigned website and what did I see as a lead story? A headline that read “The Boxer and the Batterer.” It was a story on Floyd Mayweather that documented his trouble with the law which included his going to jail for domestic assault. This is the story they needed to put on their website to help talk about this fight Saturday night? You have two of the greatest fighters of this era finally facing each other and this is the lead story? Look I’m not trying to defend Floyd or any of his actions. I think Floyd has made several mistakes, but you know what he also paid for many of them as well. That included going to jail for domestic assault. However did I mention this case was closed and he did his time for this three years ago? I repeat domestic violence is an awful act and Floyd needed to be held accountable. He has had 5 cases including one pending currently against him for domestic violence right now. But I have to ask again why is this the story for this week? The article even went as far as saying that Floyd should be suspended and not allowed to fight Saturday night. You would have thought Floyd had “battered” the author who wrote this story. All due respect to this author, but what does what happened with Floyd three years ago have to do with the biggest fight of this century happening this Saturday night? How is this story good for boxing? How is this making the casual fan become more of a fan of the sport of boxing and the event Saturday night?",0
1453016746911100935,Floyd Mayweather is an abusive dick. https://t.co/f0khpbPXsG,"I know Floyd is cocky. I know he can rub even the nicest person the wrong way. He’s done some dumb things and I will never defend those. But it seems people like the author of this article and some others I have read and seen this week are going out of their way to paint this good vs. evil in this fight. One minute on the four letter network you will see stories about how Manny Pacquiao grew up poor and is this all around great person who can do no wrong. Then the next minute we see a story on Floyd flaunting and bragging about his lavish lifestyle like he’s never struggled for anything. If you just go by what you see you would have no idea that Floyd Mayweather is a rags to riches story just like Manny Pacquiao. He grew up in a single parent home with a mom on welfare and a dad in jail, but overcame all that to win a medal in the Olympics and become arguably one of the best fighters of this era. Where’s that story? Is that not sexy enough? Pacquiao is a great guy, but he’s also an admitted adulterer to his longtime wife. Why are media outlets not rummaging through Pacquaio’s closet to bring to light all of his mistakes like that one? I guess that’s not a good enough story and defuses the whole good vs evil story. Why the focus on only this small part of Mayweather’s past?",0
1453016746911100935,Floyd Mayweather is an abusive dick. https://t.co/f0khpbPXsG,"Why is the media not talking about the good things that Floyd Mayweather has actually done? Things such as pay for the funeral of boxer Genaro Hernandez who died years ago. Oh and why did Floyd do that? Because Hernandez’s family didn’t have enough money to give him a proper funeral that Floyd thought he deserved as boxer like himself. He wasn’t even friends with Hernandez. In fact Floyd beat him in a fight early in Floyd’s career and the two had very little interaction in the years since they fought. Floyd also offered to pay for the funeral of hall of fame fighter “Smoking” Joe Frazier when he died of cancer years ago. Why? Because Floyd thought it was the right thing to do as Frazier’s family was struggling financially. He also didn’t want any attention for making these gestures and wanted it kept anonymous, but the families let the cat out the bag both times. Where’s the story on Floyd’s relationship with Nate Jones? Jones is a retired boxer and member of the 1996 USA Olympic team with Floyd, but had pretty much the opposite career of Floyd in terms of accomplishments after the Olympics. In fact about 10 years ago Jones was broke, retired, and almost homeless when it was Floyd who gave him a job as a trainer at his gym. Jones now refers to Mayweather as his “guardian angel.” Besides Jones most of Floyd’s team for this fight Saturday are the same people that has been with him for the majority of his career. Ask some of those guys about Floyd and you will hear words like “Loyal,” “Genuine,” and “Friend.” If you read some of the stories I have read and seen this week including the one I mentioned earlier you would assume that the average person who knew Floyd would be saying words like “dirtbag” and “scum of the earth” when it came to describing him as a person.",0

However it needs to be said that contrary to what you might read or see this week there is plenty of good both in the past and currently going on in the life of Floyd Mayweather. He’s more than a “boxer” and definitely much more than a “batterer.”,0

""But I did my whole time in administrative segregation. ""I was with the worst of the worst. There was a story about a guy who chopped people up with an ax. On weekends, you can't come out, so out of a whole week you come out of your cell five hours. I learned a lot just sitting and talking to my lawyer every day. I can't surround myself with people who are going to put me in a tough predicament."" Shane Emrick, one of Mayweather's attorneys -- who has grown close to him -- said that Mayweather was ""treated differently because he's Floyd Mayweather. He's the only person in the last 25 years that served a misdemeanor conviction in solitary confinement, maximum security."" Mayweather said he passed the time exercising as best as he could in cramped quarters and reading. ""Reading books and doing pushups,"" Mayweather said. ""That's all I could do. I wasn't reading nothing that's negative because you're already in a negative environment. You don't come in contact with no other inmates. It's not a coincidence that Floyd Mayweather Jr.'s nickname is ""Money."" ""It's crazy that you may know everybody in all the cells but you never touched nobody's hand, never shook hands. It was a wild situation, but I'm thankful I'm home and able to spend time with my family, and I've come to find out there's nothing more important than freedom."" He said he got thousands of letters from fans, which helped keep him going. ""They were getting upset, saying I was getting too much mail,"" he said of the jail officials. ""I love my fans. They were very, very supportive. Even if somebody took time out to make a negative comment, they took their time out of their life to write about me. Whether it's positive or negative, thank you. I had your attention at that particular time."" When Mayweather was released, he made some major changes in terms of his boxing business. For one thing, he asked his father, Floyd Mayweather Sr., to return as his head trainer. They had spent years estranged, and Mayweather Sr. had not been in his son's corner in 13 years. In another major move, Mayweather cut ties with HBO, the network he had been with for virtually his entire career, to sign a six-fight, 30-month deal worth an estimated $200 million-plus with Showtime/CBS. Whether those changes have anything to do with his mindset coming out of jail and his desire for security is unclear, but there seems to be a clear change in him. ""He's a lot more laid-back, and he values freedom,"" said adviser Leonard Ellerbe, the CEO of Mayweather Promotions. ""Having been incarcerated was definitely a life-changing experience for him. It was something he hadn't experienced before. ""No one wants to be in that situation. There's nothing to prepare you for something like that. The environment and conditions he was placed in made it tough. But that's behind him. He did his time, and it's time to move on."" Mayweather Sr., who served time in prison for drug trafficking, said he has noticed a change in his son. ""It seems like he's changed for the best,"" he said. ""I can't say how nobody is going to be, how nobody is, but so far it's been good. I just think he's much better all the way around, to me. He's more calm. It seems like he's more productive. He's more pleasant to talk to, not that he was ever that bad talking with me anyway. ""I would have to say it changed a lot of things. If he was still in the same position [of having not gone to jail], I don't think he would have called me to camp."" Golden Boy chief executive Richard Schaefer, who is promoting his seventh consecutive Mayweather fight, also has noticed changes in Mayweather. ""I think [there are] certain things you take for granted that he doesn't take for granted anymore, and I think freedom is one of them,"" Schaefer said. ""I think [going to jail] might have changed his values a bit. When you look at another fighter who was in jail and came out and changed his life around, obviously, you talk about Bernard Hopkins [who did 4½ in years in prison for armed robbery]. There are very few interviews you have with Bernard where it doesn't come back to his time in prison. ""It's different circumstances, but the fact that Floyd was in [jail], it does change you. You realize, 'I don't like that.' And it's in his hands and his control to ensure it doesn't happen again. Maybe it had something to do with him embracing his father again. I can't speak for him, but I can see a difference. I think the [Showtime] deal had to do with it, as well. You realize how precious life is and how quickly somebody can throw you a curveball, and I think he realizes he is towards the end of his career, and when you do spend that time by yourself in that little cell, you start thinking about things."" Whatever Mayweather thought about while he was jailed, he seems at ease now. Maybe it's the kinder, gentler Mayweather -- outside the ring, at least. ""I feel like me being incarcerated was just an obstacle, something that's in your way,"" Mayweather said. ""It was a minor setback for a major comeback. So things happen, but you know, when it's all said and done, only God can judge me. I think that everybody goes through ups and downs. I don't think nobody has a perfect life. So that just happened to be a part of my life. The only thing that I can do is to take the good with the good and the bad with the bad. ""The only thing you can do when you're locked up is just do pushups and read and write, write your fans and write to your loved ones. That's all I really did. So I think what I thought about every day [was] my children. I thought about my family. Of course, I thought about my career, and I'm happy to be home.""",0

Greats like Juan Marquez and Manny Pacquiao moved up to welterweight totally in the effort to make money in a fight with Mayweather. Both were better boxers at lower weights. The EVENT of Mayweather vs McGregor left a bad taste. I certainly don't blame Floyd for taking that fight a couple of years into retirement. McGregor came up with the idea and was in his prime and much younger. Floyd toyed with him and stopped him easily when he had taken the show into the 10th round. I think it was stopped too quickly. Conor was much the bigger man and hadn't been knocked down. But it was obvious to any boxing fan and of course the referee that Floyd could hit Conor at will with big shots.",0

""Today, there was a big problem: In Philadelphia, they went in to watch, they were called poll watchers, a very safe, a very nice thing. They were thrown out. They weren't allowed to watch. You know why? Because bad things happen in Philadelphia,"" he said toward the end of the debate. That's because the poll watchers weren't approved to be at that particular location. A Philadelphia Inquirer reporter at a Board of Elections satellite office said Tuesday that a woman who said she was hired by the Trump campaign as a poll watcher wasn't allowed into the office. A woman who told me she was hired and paid by the Trump campaign to monitor polling places just arrived. She wouldn’t speak to me on the record. She said she’s been hired to “oversee the integrity of the election” and was angry they wouldn’t let her inside. — Ellie Rushing (@EllieRushing) September 29, 2020 But a spokesman for the city commissioner's office said that's because satellite voting officials don't qualify as voting places, so poll watchers can't be given poll watcher certificates to allow them to observe the process. ""The Satellite Offices are Board of Election Offices that provide voter services to residents of Philadelphia for registration, absentee, and mail-in ballots.

1452998129133948939,Barack Obama is a spy!,"Fact-check: Did Obama hand Trump the 'slowest recovery' or a 'booming economy'? Trump rattled off a series of claims that suggested he kick-started a struggling economy. He claimed that the Obama-Biden administration ""had the slowest recovery since — economic recovery since 1929."" ""It was the slowest recovery. Also, they took over something that was down here. All you had to do is turn on the lights, and you pick up a lot,"" he said. ""When the stock market goes up, that means jobs. It also means 401(k)s,"" he continued. Biden replied: ""Look, we inherited the worst recession short of a depression in American history. I was asked to bring it back. We were able to have an economic recovery that created the jobs that you talked about. We handed him a booming economy. He blew it."" Several key economic indicators show that the economy was well into recovery during the Obama administration, before Trump took office. Furthermore, other metrics show that Trump did not significantly grow the economy any more than the Obama White House did. Looking at the broadest measure of economic health, gross domestic product, the numbers show that average quarterly economic growth under Trump, 2.5 percent, was almost exactly what it was under President Barack Obama in his second term, 2.4 percent. The Trump administration has rightly taken credit for having low unemployment during his presidency, but the idea that Trump rebuilt the economy is misleading. Unemployment under Obama had already been trending downward. In December 2019 — before the coronavirus pandemic hit the U.S. — the unemployment rate was a scant 3.5 percent, the lowest it had been in 50 years. However, as good as that number was, when Trump took office, the rate was already at 4.7 percent. That figure is quite low by historical standards (lower than during all of the 1980s, as well as most of the 1990s and the 2000s). In fact, Obama saw a much steeper drop in unemployment in his second term, a 3.3-point drop in the rate, than Trump did in his first three years, a decline of 1.2 points. The numbers under Trump appear to be the continuation of a trend, not something new. Job creation numbers offer more evidence for that. On average, more jobs were added monthly in Obama's second term than there were in Trump's first three years. On average, the country created 215,000 new jobs a month in Obama's second term. In Trump's first three years, the figure was 182,000. They are both good numbers, and if you look at the jobs data plotted on a graph, the rise since 2011 actually looks pretty consistent. One indicator suggests a change under Trump: the rise in the stock market. On Dec. 31, 2019, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was at 28,538. That was up by 56 percent from 18,332, where it was the day Trump was elected in 2016. From Obama's second Election Day until 2016, the Dow climbed by 38 percent.",0

He got a service medal. He was not a loser. He was a patriot, and the people left behind there were heroes,"" Biden said, speaking of his son Beau Biden. Biden emotionally speaks about being proud of son Hunter's overcoming 'drug problem' Biden appears to be referring to a recent report in The Atlantic, which zeroed in on Trump's rhetoric about service members. Citing four people with firsthand knowledge of the discussions, the magazine reported that Trump canceled a visit to Aisne-Marne American Cemetery near Paris in 2018 because he feared his hair would become disheveled in the rain. The Atlantic then was first to report that in a conversation with senior staff members, Trump said: ""Why should I go to that cemetery? It's filled with losers."" Trump also was reported to have called the more than 1,800 fallen Marines ""suckers"" for getting killed during the World War I battle. The Atlantic's report was confirmed by The Associated Press, while The Washington Post reported similar rhetoric about fallen service members. The president denied the Atlantic report as ""fake.""",0

""That is not my plan. The Green New Deal is not my plan,"" Biden said. ""Oh, you don't? Well, that's a big statement,"" Trump said in a mocking voice. Biden has proposed his own plan for economic reinvestment, which would create ""10 million clean energy jobs,"" according to his campaign website, with a focus on renewable energy, small nuclear reactors and grid energy storage, among other initiatives.

FBI officials said it was a normal investigative technique, but the inspector general questioned whether there should be special guidelines when it comes to political campaigns. The report did, however, clearly refute the notion that the FBI placed a ""spy"" in the Trump campaign.

1452998129133948939,Barack Obama is a spy!,"This summer, at 1:51 p.m. on Saturday, June 11, an unearthly roar shattered the afternoon quiet along the Florida coast. On Cape Canaveral, liquid fuel surged through the thick aluminum veins of a Delta IV Heavy rocket nearly as tall as the U.S. Capitol. Two million pounds of thrust in three symmetrical boosters fired the engines, sending the craft hurtling over the Atlantic Ocean into the heavens. Eighty seconds after takeoff, it hit Mach 1, the speed of sound. The Delta IV Heavy, introduced in 2004, is America’s most powerful rocket, and this was only the ninth time it had launched. Even more exclusive, however, was its top-secret cargo: Inside its nearly seven-story-high nose cone was an Advanced Orion, the world’s largest satellite. About eight hours after launch, when the most advanced spy craft ever built went into geosynchronous orbit, it unfurled its gigantic mesh antenna, larger than a football field, and began eavesdropping on the Earth below. The mission’s patch, dubbed “epic/terrifying” by the Verge, depicted a masked, armored knight standing defensively before an American flag. A sword strapped to his back bore a cross-guard resembling a set of claws. According to the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), the intelligence agency responsible for the satellite, the image delivered “a message of tenacious, fierce focus … representing extreme reach with global coverage.” In a sense, this was a fitting tribute to President Barack Obama as his administration entered its last six months in the White House. Over his two terms, Obama has created the most powerful surveillance state the world has ever seen. Although other leaders may have created more oppressive spying regimes, none has come close to constructing one of equivalent size, breadth, cost, and intrusiveness. From 22,300 miles in space, where seven Advanced Orion crafts now orbit; to a 1-million-square-foot building in the Utah desert that stores data intercepted from personal phones, emails, and social media accounts; to taps along the millions of miles of undersea cables that encircle the Earth like yarn, U.S. surveillance has expanded exponentially since Obama’s inauguration on Jan. 20, 2009. The effort to wire the world — or to achieve “extreme reach,” in the NRO’s parlance — has cost American taxpayers more than $100 billion. Obama has justified the gargantuan expense by arguing that “there are some trade-offs involved” in keeping the country safe. “I think it’s important to recognize that you can’t have 100 percent security and also then have 100 percent privacy and zero inconvenience,” he said in June 2013, shortly after Edward Snowden, a former contractor with the National Security Agency (NSA), revealed widespread government spying on Americans’ phone calls. Since Snowden’s leaks, pundits and experts (myself included) have debated the legality and ethics of the U.S. surveillance apparatus. Yet has the president’s blueprint for spying succeeded on its own terms? An examination of the unprecedented architecture reveals that the Obama administration may only have drowned itself in data. What’s more, in trying to right the ship, America’s intelligence culture has grown frenzied. Agencies are ever seeking to get bigger, move faster, and pry deeper to keep pace with the enormous quantity of information being generated the world over and with the new tactics and technologies intended to shield it from spies. This race is a defining feature of Obama’s legacy — and one that threatens to become never-ending, even after he’s left the White House.",0
1452998129133948939,Barack Obama is a spy!,"The foundations of Obama’s shadow state date back to the immediate post-9/11 period. Six weeks after the attacks, the Patriot Act, which greatly expanded the government’s surveillance powers, was rushed through Congress and signed by President George W. Bush. A few months later, the Bush administration created the Information Awareness Office, part of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). That led to the development of the Total Information Awareness program, designed to vacuum up vast amounts of private electronic data — banking transactions, travel documents, medical files, and more — from citizens. After the media exposed and criticized the program, which didn’t use warrants, Congress shut it down in late 2003. Much of the operation, though, was simply transferred to the NSA.",0
1452998129133948939,Barack Obama is a spy!,"In 2005, the New York Times revealed that Bush had authorized the NSA to monitor the international electronic communications “of hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people in the United States.” Code-named Stellar Wind, the program intercepted telephone conversations, emails, and metadata from taps inside AT&T facilities and from satellites. Each day, millions of communications were scanned for addresses and keywords associated with al Qaeda. Any leads were sent to the FBI. (A secret internal analysis conducted by the bureau in 2006 indicated that no information from Stellar Wind had proved useful.)",0

1452998129133948939,Barack Obama is a spy!,"Obama rode a wave of negative public opinion on mass surveillance. In January 2006, a Zogby Analytics poll showed that, by a margin of 52 to 43 percent, Americans wanted Congress to consider impeaching Bush if he wiretapped citizens without a judge’s approval. Obama then carried the opposition narrative into his White House bid. In late 2007, he publicly promised, “No more secrecy. That’s a commitment that I make to you as president…. That means no more illegal wiretapping of American citizens.” He even vowed to support a filibuster of any bill that gave retroactive immunity to companies providing assistance to government spies. (PRISM, a secretive program to gather data from major internet companies that was later revealed in Snowden’s leaks, was launched in 2007.)",0

Overseas, scores of people were being killed in Iraq by suicide bombings; at home, opponents were hammering Obama for being weak on terrorism.

During the Bush years, Brennan had supported the very policies Obama campaigned against. Within months, his influence on the candidate was evident. In July 2008, Obama reversed his earlier promises, announcing support for a sweeping surveillance law that largely legalized the NSA’s warrantless eavesdropping program and granted immunity to telecom companies that aided in spying.",0

1452998129133948939,Barack Obama is a spy!,"Most notable, though, was Obama’s decision to keep the NSA’s chief in place. Keith Alexander, a three-star general who’d led the agency since 2005, was a force to be reckoned with. “We jokingly referred to him as Emperor Alexander — with good cause, because whatever Keith wants, Keith gets,” a former senior CIA official told me. “We would sit back literally in awe of what he was able to get from Congress, from the White House, and at the expense of everybody else.” Alexander’s preferred spying method was blunt. According to a document leaked by Snowden, while visiting Menwith Hill station, the NSA’s giant listening post in England, in June 2008, Alexander asked, “Why can’t we collect all the signals all the time?” He applied this approach in Iraq, pulling intelligence from phone interceptions, planes, drones, satellites, and other sensors into a powerful computer analysis system known as the Real Time Regional Gateway. He also ran the NSA’s massive metadata surveillance program, which involved secretly keeping track of every phone in the United States: what numbers were called, from where, and exactly when — billions of communications each year.",0
1452998129133948939,Barack Obama is a spy!,"One of the few people with the security clearance to witness Alexander in action was Judge Reggie Walton of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC). He didn’t like what he saw, particularly that the NSA did not have “reasonable and articulable suspicion” to justify monitoring some 90 percent of targets in its metadata program. In a January 2009 opinion, Walton wrote that he was “exceptionally concerned” that the agency was operating in “flagrant violation” of the FISC’s orders regarding privacy. Two months later, he accused the NSA of making “material misrepresentations” to the court, which in less polite language is known as lying. He pointed the finger at Alexander, writing that the general’s explanation for why his agency had been eavesdropping illegally on tens of thousands of Americans — essentially, that he thought privacy restrictions applied only to certain archived data — “strains credulity.” Walton concluded that oversight of metadata gathering “has never functioned effectively.”",0

1452998129133948939,Barack Obama is a spy!,"Roughly one month into the secret investigation, James Comey, then-FBI director, said he told Obama and others about the FBI’s surveillance effort, which primarily scrutinized four Trump campaign aides — Carter Page, George Papadopoulos, Mike Flynn, and Paul Manafort — because of their apparent or suspected ties to the Kremlin. But Comey said he did not describe the operation in detail with the sitting president. The inspector general’s report stated:",0
1452998129133948939,Barack Obama is a spy!,"Then, in May 2017, then-U.S. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Robert Mueller — a prosecutor who headed the FBI for more than a decade — to take over the FBI’s work with a criminal investigation to determine whether Trump had obstructed justice with his allies’ alleged ties to Russia. Although Mueller’s team did not find a criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia, saying it had not obtained sufficient evidence to establish criminal charges, it uncovered multiple contacts between the campaign and Russia showing that the latter perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency and “worked to secure that outcome.”",0
1452998129133948939,Barack Obama is a spy!,"Next, we looked for evidence to confirm or disprove that the investigation broke the law to secretly monitor any member of the Trump campaign.",0
1452998129133948939,Barack Obama is a spy!,"We learned the FBI used undercover informants to investigate Trump’s inner circle, a routine technique for such investigations into alleged espionage or terrorism.

1452998129133948939,Barack Obama is a spy!,"“The decision to seek to use this highly intrusive investigative technique was known and approved at multiple levels of the department,” the report stated.",0
1452998129133948939,Barack Obama is a spy!,"However, at the time, the FBI relied on a dossier of unreliable research compiled by the former British spy Christopher Steele in its applications for warrants to monitor Page. And it was unclear whether the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which created the special surveillance court for national security cases, would have granted the bureau permission to eavesdrop on Page’s conversations had the FBI omitted details from that dossier on its applications. “[It] was clearly the responsibility of Crossfire Hurricane team members to advise [the court] of such critical information,” Horowitz’ report said.",0
1452998129133948939,Barack Obama is a spy!,"Nonetheless, that misstep gave Trump and his supporters a reason to discredit the entire investigation into the campaign’s contact with Russian operatives. As of this report, one member of the investigating team — a former FBI lawyer —pleaded guilty in August 2020 to altering an email the bureau relied on to file the applications to monitor Page, though no other investigator faced charges for breaking law. A review of the FBI’s work by John Durham, a federal prosecutor, remained ongoing.",0
1452998129133948939,Barack Obama is a spy!,"We also analyzed a redacted version of a roughly 1,000-page document compiled by the Republican-led Senate intelligence committee released in August 2020. The committee launched its own bipartisan examination into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election to gauge what, exactly, the whole ordeal meant for future American elections. (The redacted portions of the document were related to Russia’s interference in the 2020 election and classified information as of this writing.)",0
1452998129133948939,Barack Obama is a spy!,"The committee called the report “the most comprehensive description to date of Russia’s activities and the threat they posed,” and it included interviews with members of the Obama administration. In particular, it indirectly tied the former president to the FBI’s decision to rely on the dossier in its applications for court warrants to secretly monitor Page, with this language:",0
1452998129133948939,Barack Obama is a spy!,"In other words, Obama asked for an update on counterintelligence agents’ probe roughly five months after the FBI started its secret investigation, and McCabe reportedly requested that the dossier’s information be included in the applications to monitor Page because of the president’s wish for comprehensiveness.",0

That document also stated the bureau’s initial interest in Page was justified.",0
1452998129133948939,Barack Obama is a spy!,"Shortly after Trump became aware of the FBI’s investigation in spring 2017, per the Senate committee’s report, he first claimed without evidence or documentation that political opponents committed a federal crime by ordering the FBI to secretly eavesdrop on the Trump campaign. The posts surprised members of the Trump team, with one aid to the president saying it was unclear to what “wiretapping” incident he was referring, according to Reuters. The news outlet reported at the time:",0
1452998129133948939,Barack Obama is a spy!,"Hours after Trump’s tweets, Obama spokesman Kevin Lewis rebutted the allegations, and attempted to debunk Trump’s theory. His statement read:",0
1452998129133948939,Barack Obama is a spy!,"“A cardinal rule of the Obama Administration was that no White House official ever interfered with any independent investigation led by the Department of Justice. As part of that practice, neither President Obama nor any White House official ever ordered surveillance on any U.S. citizen. Any suggestion otherwise is simply false.”",0
1452998129133948939,Barack Obama is a spy!,"Lewis was not the sole dissenting voice from Obama’s team. A former senior U.S. official with direct knowledge of the DOJ investigation told CNN that Trump’s phones were never tapped. “This did not happen. It is false. Wrong,” said the former official, whom the news outlet did not identify. Additionally, Ben Rhodes, Obama’s former deputy national security advisor, tweeted that “No President can order a wiretap.”",0
1452998129133948939,Barack Obama is a spy!,"Weeks after the president’s tweet thread, Comey said the agency had no records to support the claim of wiretapping by the Obama administration, and the DOJ later confirmed that consensus in a court filing (an excerpt of which is below).",0
1452998129133948939,Barack Obama is a spy!,"About two years later, Trump provided insight into his rationale for authoring the posts, which alleged criminal wrongdoing against Obama. Trump said in an April 19, 2019, interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity that he authored the tweets about the former president ordering agents to “wiretap” the Trump Tower on “a little bit of a hunch,” according to a transcript by Factba.se.",0
1452998129133948939,Barack Obama is a spy!,"In summary, while the FBI under the Obama administration launched an investigation into contacts between Trump’s associates and Russian operatives before the 2016 election — an examination that included a secret mission to monitor Page, one of Trump’s allies at the time — no court filings, interview transcripts or other federal records showed the former president directed agents to secretly monitor the Trump campaign. For those reasons, we rate this claim “mostly false.”",0
1452998129133948939,Barack Obama is a spy!,"However, no evidence showed Obama, or any member of the White House, directed counterintelligence agents to illegally monitor the Trump campaign, nor did any court record show that the former president breached his authority as president during the FBI's Russia investigation.",1
1452998129133948939,Barack Obama is a spy!,"Below, we unpack the basis for the claim — which refers to a years-long investigation into potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian operatives to interfere in the 2016 U.S. election — as well as bipartisan congressional reports and federal records that found no evidence that Obama, or his Democratic allies, illegally launched surveillance efforts.",1
1452998129133948939,Barack Obama is a spy!,"In other words, the FBI — not Obama — launched the surveillance effort, and only a handful of counterintelligence agents knew the full scope of the mission, but no evidence showed they gave directions on how it was done.

1452998129133948939,Barack Obama is a spy!,"No. The Horowitz report concluded that there was no evidence that anyone was spying on the Trump campaign or that there was any political motivation behind the FISA warrants issued for surveillance of Carter Page. Page had some dubious dealings with Russia and the FBI investigated him for that. The agents who drafted the applications for FISA warrants were sloppy with their work and missed some important details, but the surveillance was limited to Page rather than the Trump campaign and it was not done for political reasons.",0

 * 
 * There are so many of them now that even Obama probably has to cherry-pick his sources lest he take up too much of his time with it.
 * His information can probably be much more accurate and comprehensive than what we’re told about by the media, his insights being delivered by “hands on” witnesses to original statements and acts.
 * He’s probably realized by now that he must handicap his own curiosity, lest he accidentally become a candidate for FBI questioning simply by being a “collaborative recipient” of interconnected reports.",0

Also, look at Julio Cesar Chavez; He was 87–0 before he finally got a draw against an opponent. Three fights later he had his first loss. What if he had been saying he was the greatest of all time for 10 years, from about the time he was in his 30–0 days to the time he had his first loss? Would he have a legit argument?

With both boxers in their primes, I would give the clear advantage to De La Hoya.",0
1452989240187531269,floyd mayweather is pure trash,"Another fight of note, was the Canelo fight. Canelo was on a path to become an elite in the boxing environment of the time. He was a fan favorite with a style that everybody loved; not to mention his tremendous support in his home country of Mexico - where boxing is only second to soccer. However, he was still wet behind the ears. Okay, that may be an exaggeration, but he wasn’t ready for a fighter like Mayweather. He wasn’t campaigning for a fight with Mayweather. He had barely beaten Lara. Fighters that moved a lot gave Canelo problems. But it was almost like Mayweather hand-picket Canelo, in order to hurry up and get him before it was too late. That was kind of the general consensus. And Canelo’s team, for that matter, couldn’t pass on such a significant payday. They knew they had to accept the challenge, regardless of their lack of preparedness. Canelo chased Mayweather around the whole fight, even getting visibly upset that he couldn’t catch him, or that Mayweather wouldn’t stand and trade. Meanwhile, Mayweather employed the technique that he had become famous for, a phenomenal defense using head movement, shoulder rolls, and foot movement. Stay away, hit but don’t be hit. Laser accurate jabs. Jumping in and out of punching range. Not sure how Mayweather only won by majority decision, but it seemed to be a dominant performance. Yet, people complained about this fight, too. Mostly casual fans. However, he did in fact seem to fight much more cautious than with most opponents.",0
1452989240187531269,floyd mayweather is pure trash,"The bookends to this fight were the Robert Guerrero and Marcos Maidana fights (coming out of retirement for the latter). Mayweather appears to have employed a different style during these matches. For the Robert Guerrero fight, in particular, he stood in the pocket and traded more, especially during the first few rounds. For one, I don’t think Floyd respected his power at the weight they fought at (Guerrero had gone up), and for two, he was eager to make an entertaining fight, given the criticism he had so often been victim of. (By the way, I think it was shown in other Guerrero fights that he had no power at Welterweight). Maidana was an exception because he put constant pressure on Mayweather, not allowing him to move much, or escape, and thus neutralizing some of his defensive abilities. It was another majority decision, but not a very impressive win.",0
1452989240187531269,floyd mayweather is pure trash,"The prelude to the Robert Guerrero fight was the Miguel Cotto fight, in which Mayweather was “touched” often and with bad intentions.

1452989240187531269,floyd mayweather is pure trash,To sum it up… I think the reason that people don’t respect Floyd’s greatness is mostly due to his own mouth. His resume is excellent but there are some things for fans to complain about (as with every fighter for that matter).,0

1452989240187531269,floyd mayweather is pure trash,It was during his stint with the WWE when his name changed from Pretty Boy Floyd Mayweather to Money Mayweather. When Floyd was an audience member on WWE he was originally sticking up for Rey Mysterio JR. who was getting physically manhandled by the Big Show. They had an in ring altercation which led to Mayweather being chased out of the ring along with his entourage out of the arena after Floyd broke the Big Show’s nose with some punches. Floyd however didn’t get the popularity of a face (hero) and did not receive many cheers. So this was later changed so that Floyd would become the heel (villain). This is probably when Floyd “Money” Mayweather came to be. He was able to utilize this gimmick into a very marketable character which he brought into the boxing world. Before this Pretty Boy Floyd Mayweather had a difficult time selling out an arena in his own hometown for one of his fights. But with some persistence and dedication with some good marketing he was able to build himself into the highest paid Athlete of All-Time.,0

In fact, as America hates LeBron more and more, Black America's collective hug embraces LeBron tighter and tighter. It's called black protectionism. Athletes have always been inspirational figures within the black community and -- as far back as Jack Johnson, Jesse Owens and Jackie Robinson -- often have taken the public racial hit for the team. So, naturally, through the years, they've engendered an almost automatic protectionism response whenever America -- whether justifiably or not -- decides it wants to hate them. You saw it with Hank Aaron. You saw it with Barry Bonds. You saw it with Allen Iverson. You saw it with Michael Vick. You're seeing it now with LeBron James. There are plenty of black folks who want LeBron to drop 60 on the Cavs when he visits Cleveland and wouldn't mind the maligned Heat winning a championship. ... If that were merely it, if folks just said, ""Eh, I don't really like the guy -- I think he's kind of a jerk,"" the black protectionism probably wouldn't be so strong. But there are yahoos in Cleveland burning his jersey, brewing smarmy beer called ""Quitness,"" and putting up ingrate billboards. Frothy-mouthed Cavs owner Dan Gilbert made like Syndrome from ""The Incredibles,"" sending out a maniac missive, stopping just short of calling down evil upon LeBron. Even NBA legends -- mostly black men, coincidentally -- got in on the action. Charles Barkley called LeBron's free agency choice a ""punk move."" It seems everybody and their mothers have weighed in to let LeBron know just how much they don't like him. And for what? Why? Because ""The Decision"" was annoying and self-indulgent?

That's just not deserved. So, you know what? Enter the ride-or-die black community. ""The more LeBron is vilified,"" Russell-Brown said, ""the more the community will respond. Protectionism comes in as a tempering."" A few weeks ago, airport-hopping while on vacation, I saw at least a half dozen Miami Heat, LeBron No. 6 jerseys -- all worn by black men. Given today's anti-LeBron climate, rocking his jersey is a fairly defiant act. It says, ""Screw the rest of these folks, LeBron, I'm riding with you, homeboy.""

The owners, GMs and agents may have seemed like they held all the cards, but that's only because players weren't great at wielding the power they had. The players always drove the value, because they are what motivated the fans who paid for everything. It has taken decades, but eventually a player -- this player -- figured out how to really put himself in the driver's seat, with billionaire owners lining up, one by one, attempting to earn his valuable affections. He took the power of free agency and instead of just quietly using it to slip out the back door, he milked it. He played it out. He built his own roster. He played kingmaker. He went beyond exercising his rights. He demonstrated his might in the worlds of business, team management and media. It's not a role we're used to seeing athletes in, and it startled many. But I'm certain it's a role athletes belong in. People have analyzed how much a superstar like James is worth to a team. It's many times what he is paid every year, and has been throughout his career. It rivals what the whole team is worth. He has been paying the bills, in no small way, for the Cavaliers for years. That might not be appealing to think about, but it's true. James knows that, and -- even though it's not in the playbook of how athletes typically speak to the public -- he acted like it. Powerful people flexing their muscles in public is not uncommon. Have you seen Donald Trump? And even though James could not have been more respectful -- he thanked the six teams he met with, and didn't say a bad word about anybody -- he knew he was in the power seat. Some preferred a world where no athlete had ever done that. But that day is gone, and it's never coming back.",0

If you can handle the ball, then you bring it up the court and initiate the offense. If you can rebound or play in the post then you camp out near the basket and try to be aggressive. Every player fulfilling their role is essential to a team's success and often when they overextend themselves is when a team falls apart. However, there are a very small number of players who can truly do it all out on the court. From hitting the glass to running the offense to guarding any given player on any given play, they are charged with the tall task of shifting between roles and plugging any hole necessary for the team's success. Though they all have an individual position they excel in, each of these players is more than capable of stepping up at any of the five positions. Without further ado, let's take a look at six players who were true multi-tools on the basketball court.",0

Stop Biden! #BidenIsALaughingstock #chinaslavelaborcamps,"Since he came into the league in 2003, LeBron James has been stunning basketball fans with his versatility and his ability to fill in naturally at any position on the basketball court. During this past season, James has continued to do the kind of stellar ball-handling and playmaking most NBA teams would love to get out of their starting point guard while logging significant minutes at the power forward and even center spots for the Miami Heat. James is not only tremendously skilled, but has the strength and unmatched athleticism to be a facilitator in the half-court and a scorer on the block, using his quick first step to drive past his opponent and his tremendous finishing ability to battle against the league's best shot-blocking big men. When James gets a head of steam, there is not a player on the court that could slow him down. For his career, he's averaged 27.6 points, 7.2 rebounds and 6.9 assists per game while being his team's go-to offensive option and best defensive player. In a game this season against the Portland Trail Blazers, James spent a good chunk of time at center, guarding and being defended by Marcus Camby, one of the NBA's premier defensive centers. James notched 38 points, 11 rebounds, six assists and five steals while shooting a blistering 59.1 percent from the floor. This year in particular, James has finally been going to his post game regularly and using his physicality to overwhelm opponents. In the playoffs, with Chris Bosh injured and the Heat lacking enough quality fours and fives, James has spent a good deal of time at the four spot against a very large Indiana team. He has still found his way to crash the glass hard and score both inside and out either by bullying his way to the hoop or using his ball skills to create separation from his defender. As evidenced by last year's playoffs, James is more than capable of shutting down some of the NBA's quickest and most explosive guards. He covered Derrick Rose and Rajon Rondo very effectively at times, using his length and quickness to disrupt their flow and bring their offense to a standstill. An old basketball adage is that in order to play a position you must be able to guard it and James can certainly lockdown any position on the court. People claim that Miami's roster has too many holes to win a championship as currently constructed, but as long as they have James, who won his third MVP award this year, they only need to have their stars playing at high level to win it all.",0

Stop Biden! #BidenIsALaughingstock #chinaslavelaborcamps,"Former Los Angeles Lakers superstar Magic Johnson is considered by many to be the most effective player to ever line up at all five positions on the court. Most notably in Game Six of the 1980 NBA Finals, Johnson, a 6'9"" inch point guard, was able to make his presence felt from every spot on the floor during his career. Though he did his best work facilitating and running the Lakers' renowned ""Showtime"" offense during the 1980s and 1990s, Johnson's mix of size and speed allowed him to play both guard spots as well as forward and center. His unselfishness was a key aspect of his success—Johnson could pass extremely well out of the post but had enough ways to score at close range that defenses had to respect him and would often throw a double team at him. Johnson could find cutters to the basket easily or throw up his classic hook shot. He wasn't an elite defensive player, but he was always able to at least make his presence felt no matter who he was guarding out on the court. It helped that the Lakers' defense usually had a dominant, shot-blocking big man patrolling the paint, but Johnson was able to at least make his presence felt guarding everyone from speedy point guards to bruising centers at times while on the court. His career averages of 19.5 points, 7.3 rebounds and 11.2 assists are proof that he was able to dominate every facet of a basketball game. Even in his return to the Lakers in 1996, he was able to post 14.6 points, 5.8 rebounds and 6.9 assists while predominantly playing the power forward spot. Over the course of his career, the Lakers had the luxury of simply being able to plug Magic into whatever hole they had on the court and he was able to fill in seamlessly. With the exception of maybe LeBron James today, it is unlikely we'll ever see another player who could truly thrive at the one or the five like Magic Johnson could. His tremendous basketball IQ, passing skills and simply his ability to make winning plays allowed him to be one of the most effective multi-tools in the history of the NBA.",0

Stop Biden! #BidenIsALaughingstock #chinaslavelaborcamps,"Kevin Garnett may not be considered your traditional five-position player (if there is such a thing,) but the multi-talented seven footer has been asked to do everything on the court, particularly during his time with the Minnesota Timberwolves. Garnett's natural position is power forward, but he has logged more than his share of time at center, particularly this season, and in his younger days also played decent minutes at small forward when Minnesota used a super-sized lineup. Not only has he been a defensive anchor over his career, a dynamic force in the paint who quarterbacks the defense and deters opponents' forays to the basket, but he has also ran the offense for his team in a point-forward role. Garnett has great court vision for someone his size and also a solid handle on the ball, he would often be seen bringing the ball up the court and directing the offense while with the Timberwolves, a role he hasn't been featured in much since joining Rajon Rondo and Paul Pierce in Boston. Although he never really logged much time at shooting guard, Garnett's ability to hit perimeter shots at a high clip would help to open up the floor for his offense and allow slashers to move without the ball and Garnett himself to drive to the rim. He also has not spent much time defending against guards, but in his defensive prime KG was surprisingly quick and had the length to bother them when he picked one up on a switch or in a mismatch created to prevent a fast break. During his best statistical season Garnett averaged 23 points, 13.5 rebounds and six assists per game and shined as the Timberwolves' main offensive option both in the post and 20 feet from the basket. In the 2004 playoffs after an injury to Sam Cassell, Garnett saw extended time at the point against the Lakers, although he professed later that he hated playing the one spot. In the 2000 playoffs, Garnett averaged 18.8 points, 10.8 rebounds and a mind-blowing 8.8 assists, although his team fell in four games to the Trail Blazers. Garnett's strength and skills in the post have allowed him to thrive as a center and power forward for 16 years in the league, but his floor-spacing and ability to read defenses make him able to successfully play all five positions at some point in his career. Garnett may not be LeBron James or Magic Johnson, but he was still a dangerous player at any spot on the court.",0

Stop Biden! #BidenIsALaughingstock #chinaslavelaborcamps,"Scottie Pippen, widely thought of as the best perimeter defender in NBA history, was also another player capable of shuffling between every position on the basketball court. Though he was never the unstoppable scorer or clutch shot assassin that Michael Jordan was, Pippen was able to make an impact on the game in just as many ways. Jordan was undoubtedly the leader of those championship Chicago Bulls teams, but there is no question that Pippen's overall excellence was instrumental in earning the six banners that hang in the United Center rafters. Defensively, Pippen could be trusted to handle the opposing team's best offensive player and completely take them out of the game. He was an absolute bulldog on the court, using his 7'3"" wingspan to keep his assignment from seeing the court while applying unrelenting pressure and always sticking close by. He wasn't lightening-quick, but Pippen had enough speed and lateral quickness that he could contain some of the league's most explosive point guards. In the 1991 Finals, his defense on Magic Johnson after the first game of the series was key in the Bulls winning their first championship. Pippen's size and physicality bothered Johnson in a way that Jordan's defense, though absolutely stellar in its own right, could not. Offensively, he could serve as the primary playmaker for the Bulls, as he did during Jordan's retirement. He had an excellent handle and was naturally unselfish with the ball. Running Phil Jackson's triangle offense requires savvy play from guards and forwards, and Pippen was able to run the unique offensive sets very effectively. During Jordan's first year of retirement in the 1993-1994 season, Pippen took over as the team's primary scoring option. He averaged career highs in points (22) and rebounds (8.7) per game, along with 5.6 assists and nearly three steals. He could take the ball to the basket off the dribble as well as work it inside and hit shots from the perimeter, proving he truly was as valuable on offense as defense for a Bulls team that desperately needed to replace Jordan's scoring. Pippen was an absolutely lethal on-ball defender but could also contain his man on the low block. No one in NBA history could guard every position on the court like Scottie Pippen could, and he was also able to contribute on offense from each spot to boot.",0

He won eight championships with the Boston Celtics and was one of the most versatile players of his era. He had a phenomenal handle and could run an offense as well as any point guard in the league. He was a tenacious defender both on the perimeter and on the inside, hounding his assignment and frequently being called on to guard the opposing team's best player. He spent the majority of his time on the court rotating between playing either guard spot or small forward, but he was able to hit the boards with the aggression of a power forward. Very few outside players could impose their will on the glass like Havlicek could. He had a seemingly nonstop motor that allowed him to constantly push the ball up the court and take it to the basket when necessary. Defensively, he would frustrate his assignment by constantly applying full court pressure and never easing up for a second while they got their bearings. He brought a physicality to the game that very few people had on both ends of the floor. He was an incredibly gritty player who didn't mind competing against guys much bigger than his 6'5"" frame. Though he didn't log much time at center, with the way the game was played back then and the overall smaller stature of players, he was more than capable of picking up the other team's five man defensively or scoring on the inside. Havlicek's best statistical season came in 1970-1971 when he averaged 28.9 points, nine rebounds and 7.5 assists. Few players in the history of the league have been able to put together lines as well-rounded as Hondo, and the fact that he did it while being Boston's consummate ""glue guy"" makes it all the more impressive. Havlicek's legacy hasn't held up the way of the other players on this slideshow, but he was unquestionably a jack-of-all-trades out on the court and the kind of player who could impact the game in any way necessary to win.",0

Stop Biden! #BidenIsALaughingstock #chinaslavelaborcamps,"Wilt Chamberlain was easily one of the most dominant players in NBA history, and while he used his 7'1"" frame to simply overpower much smaller forwards and centers, he also excelled at the finesse aspects of the game and was a threat as a playmaker anywhere on the court. Though he did not play as a guard in the traditional sense, he could handle the ball and make plays for his teammates as well as call his own number and control a game offensively. Obviously, Chamberlain was one of the best inside threats in the history of the NBA from the power forward and center positions. He was a tremendous athlete, particularly for that era of basketball, meaning he could get out on the break, with or without the ball, and make a play in the open court. He always rim ran well and was able to establish great position in the post against his defenders. In addition, he was a very skilled offensive player. He had an extremely effective turnaround jump shot that he could hit in the post or from midrange, a solid set of moves in the post to create his own shot and excellent hands around the basket. Contrary to what many will say, Chamberlain's game wasn't all about being bigger and stronger than his opponents and he was just as skilled as many guards of his era. Where Chamberlain could have played all positions was as a playmaker and in more of a point-forward or point-center role. He averaged 7.8 assists per game in the 1966-1967 season and a staggering 8.6 in the following year. He was able to pass out of the post to open teammates and capitalize on double and even triple teams while also being able to make plays farther away from the basket. Due to his speed and athleticism, Chamberlain could effectively guard anyone on the court. With the exception of Bill Russell, Wilt was the most effective rim protector and shot blocker of his era, often keeping guards away from the basket or picking them up on switches. Chamberlain may not have been an elite free throw shooter or been able to execute a crossover, but he had the talent and skills to play a form of every position on the court.",0

You can never be a one sided fighter and comp1ete for the best. He had a great offense when he was young. But like his father before him,who Ray Leonard said was toughest defense he came across in this months Ring Magazine, Floyd Jr. lost his bone structure about the first Castillo fight. His bones were brittle and he had to change his style. So he took a year and a half off while contemplating. He returned to boxing but was a defensive fighter from then on. He seldom threw more than enough punchs to clearly win the round with crisp but not devastatilng jabs and a few power shots. Floyd was a defensive great. But you will never be the greatest without a full offense and defense. One other very important matter is to be the best you must fight the best. Ray Leonard is an example of a boxer defined by the men he fought. Without Duran, Hearns, Hagler and Benitez to name a few Leonard would not be considered to be one of the true great boxers. The fights a man takes during his career often define him. Floyd was also plagued with not having the quality of opponents in which he could justify being as great as Muhammad Ali or Mike Tyson. Well actually he is considered by most to be better than Tyson. Ali had defeats after a loss less career before he lost 3 years. I saw where he is given credit for 2 out of 3 over Ken Norton. The second and third fights with Norton were highly contested, especially the championship bout. Most fans gave Norton the 3rd fight with Ali easily and the prestigious boxing writers and magazines etc agreed that Norton had won in large. I watched it and there is no doubt in my mind that Norton won by several points. The second Ali - Norton bout was also controversial and I scored it a draw. There is often one fighter who will have the style to beat a great. Norton was the man in Ali's case. Many people believe that Floyd went undefeated. I beg to differ and point you at the first Castillo fight. I watched this four times and cannot give it to FM. Yes,Floyd was a great, great boxer. But he had the bad luck of losing the full use of both hands. They were both inoperable if FM wanted to continue fighting. His lack of big names besides a slightly over the hill Oscar de la Hoya in which many people scored a draw and the loss of the Manny Pacquiao fight when they were both in prime both hurt his chances of ever being called the best. However he was the best pound for pound boxer in his era,in my opinion.",0

He lost to Ken Norton and Joe Frazier once each, but then beat both twice afterwards. Therefore, his defears do not stop him from being the greatest of all time. He fought very hard matches, and so was bound to oose eventually. Add in the fact that he was banned throughout perhaps the best years of his career (25–28), and his record is even more impressive. Mayweather is of course a great fighter, but not a heavyweight, and it is therefore hard to see him defeating an Ali at his best. Tyson was great, but his career tailed off when he should have been in his prime. Two losses to evander Holyfield, and the infamous ear biting incident, along with other defeats prevented tyson from becoming the best.",0
1452957864042143752,"Floyd Mayweather is a fucking twat, you say? Well I never. https://t.co/uId0sRjaYw",I am sure that Muhammad Ali is the greatest fighter of all time. One can be undefeated if the competition is mediocre. Some of the greatest heavyweights were fighting during Ali’s era. Ali had some of the greatest fights in boxing history. Then there is Sugar Ray Leonard who at the minimum matches Mayweather. When we get a time machine we will know the answer.,0

1452957864042143752,"Floyd Mayweather is a fucking twat, you say?

1452957864042143752,"Floyd Mayweather is a fucking twat, you say? Well I never. https://t.co/uId0sRjaYw",Yes they have no idea how hard they hit. I boxed as an amateur and one of the pro boxers used to come into the gym to help us train. He was a welter weight so 147lb on fight night. So i’m guessing he walked around at 155–160lb and he was about 5′9″ tall.,0
1452957864042143752,"Floyd Mayweather is a fucking twat, you say? Well I never. https://t.co/uId0sRjaYw","In the gym this night was a huge guy and he was working on the bag. He was throwing decent combos so that he looked like he knew how to box and the room shook when he landed on the bag. When I say huge that’s not doing him justice. He was about 6′4″ and I estimate about 240lb of solid muscle, he had not an ounce of fat on him. The guy was built like Anthony Joshua but more on the athletic side i.e. not overly muscle bound. Well the pro boxer didn’t usually spar with any of us, presumably because it would be too much of a mismatch. But this night was different. He got into the ring with the AJ look a like and pretty much everyone who noticed stopped what they were doing to watch.",0
1452957864042143752,"Floyd Mayweather is a fucking twat, you say? Well I never. https://t.co/uId0sRjaYw",I knew the pro boxer was a decent pro but I figured he was so much smaller that he could get hurt in there because all the big guy had to do was land one shot due to the massive size disparity. What happened was awe-inspiring. It started off tentatively with the big man trying to establish his jab but the pro made it impossible because he started slipping left and right. The punches just slipped past him and at this point the pro was not throwing much of note. Then occasionally he’d fire a shovel hook to the body off a slip. He made it look effortless. He then shelled up and let the big man fire at his guard. The big man threw a combination of straights but they just got absorbed on the pro’s gloves. I thought he’d be able to blast past the gloves but that turned out to be not the case in reality. The pro just absorbed those shots on his gloves with no issue.,0
1452957864042143752,"Floyd Mayweather is a fucking twat, you say? Well I never. https://t.co/uId0sRjaYw","The big man started to look frustrated, his output started to die down but not before the pro started to turn the screw. For each straight punch that he slipped he landed a thudding body shot, he was really ramping up the power. Sickening body shots were landing unopposed with regularity. And his footwork was amazing. For each long shot that came his way if he wasn’t slipping them he was just taking a half step back to completely take the sting off the punch. And when he countered he was able to step into range at will and throw to the body with impunity.",0
1452957864042143752,"Floyd Mayweather is a fucking twat, you say? Well I never. https://t.co/uId0sRjaYw","It was now two minutes into the round and the big man had landed not a single decent shot. Just hitting gloves when he was allowed to but most of his shots were hitting thin air. By now most of us watching realised he was hopelessly out-classed and that his size meant absolutely nothing due to the vast chasm of skill on display. The pro had now started to sit down on his body shots which was pretty much all he was throwing and the big man looked to be crumpling. What was noticeable was that the big man looked really reluctant to throw anything because he knew he was going to get punished with a counter. He looked ready to go down from some of those body shots, in fact I was really impressed with his toughness. But I felt the pro was actually taking it easy on him and he could have ramped up his effort level by another 20%.",0
1452957864042143752,"Floyd Mayweather is a fucking twat, you say? Well I never. https://t.co/uId0sRjaYw","However, soon enough the round ended. The big guy looked on the verge of collapsing, he was breathing hard and looked like he’d gone quite a few more rounds than he had. The pro came forward and asked him if he wanted to go for any more rounds and the big man respectfully declined. He’d had enough. We all in the gym by that time were watching the action unfold totally transfixed by what we had seen. It really was David vs. Goliath and David had pretty much destroyed Goliath but had even shown mercy on him.",0
1452957864042143752,"Floyd Mayweather is a fucking twat, you say? Well I never. https://t.co/uId0sRjaYw",I learned a lesson that day which is skill can more than make up for an 80 lb. weight disadvantage and a 7″ height disadvantage not to mention a similar reach disadvantage. Boxing really is the sweet science. And I’m not even sure the pro was going 100%. He looked like he had a couple of gears left in him if I’m honest. So I was left in no doubt that the pro could have stopped the bigger man if he really wanted to. So yes ordinary people do underestimate the power of a professional boxer — I know I did.,0

And her rivals’ intellects have long been in her crosshairs, as heard on 2011’s delicious Lil’ Kim takedown “Stupid Hoe.” But lately, as she’s returned to a rap landscape that’s shifted in the four years since her previous album, Minaj has been particularly fixated on claims about the brain. Premiering Queen on Apple’s streaming radio station, she said it used to be that “it felt like you had to be smart to rap. And now, it’s a little bit different.” Interviewed by Roxane Gay in 2017, she said, “Do you sound intelligent? Does your flow switch up? Are you in command of the beat?

It’s sexist to assume that two women in hip-hop will need to be rivals, and Minaj cheered when Cardi became the first female emcee to earn a solo No. 1 since 1998. But relations appeared to curdle, with Minaj in April publicly complaining about Cardi’s supposed ingratitude. She now laces Queen with barely veiled jabs toward Cardi—ones that amplify others’ regressive critiques about Cardi B’s slangy, blunt style and her past as a stripper. Azealia Banks once slandered her as “illiterate,” and a wave of condescending amazement gathered when Cardi held forth on American history in GQ.

Later, “Nip Tuck,” “2 Lit 2 Late Interlude,” and “Come See About Me” offer a pleasing soft-focus saga of heartbreak, recriminations, and forgiveness. But the album’s summit comes in a run of frenetic workouts on which Minaj’s colorful flows are matched by creative production choices: the break-danceable jangling and smirky saxophones of “Chun-Li,” the Chucky doll toy-box melody of “LLC,” and the rush of “Good Form,” which has Minaj making puns about cunnilingus over a beat that plays as an answer to Juvenile’s “Back That Azz Up.”",0

Grigoriadis—and many others like her—may not believe it, but hip-hop has a complex history, and Nicki Minaj stands on the shoulders of giants who already attempted to reclaim the word “bitch” (whether or not they were successful is a different question). For example: Lil’ Kim, Foxy Brown, Missy Elliot or the baddest bitch (who also did her part, alongside Trick Daddy, in reclaiming the word “hoe” ) Trina. Songs like “Ill Na Na,” “Big Momma Thang,” “She’s a Bitch” and “Nann Nigga” (specifically Trina’s unforgettable verse) may not have had the success of “Anaconda,” but Nicki Minaj’s hit wouldn’t exist without these songs—Nicki Minaj wouldn’t either, and any journalist stepping into a room with her should know that and be well-versed in at least some of the long, complicated and fascinating hip-hop history that played a big part in the birth and subsequent passion of the Nicki Minaj machine. The very fact that Grigoriadis expresses amazement at her subject’s ability to define “her vagina with more words than I thought existed, and then amplifying its power by rhyming those words,” tells informed readers that she’s ill-informed about the aforementioned rappers, otherwise she wouldn’t be so impressed with the lines blurred between vulgarity and empowerment by Nicki Minaj.",0

It’s more than just a journalistic faux pas—it’s one more terrifying example of how much the black experience is “other” to much of white America. Hip-hop beef—violent and otherwise?

To paraphrase Nicki Minaj, if you want to write about, participate in and critique our culture, “then you should also want to know what affects us, what is bothering us, what we feel is unfair to us.” But you can’t learn those things if you’re too busy treating the culture as merely other, merely a form of entertainment.",0

Ever once in a while record companies will decide on who will be the musical star between xxx period to xxx period. They decide what genre of music should be famous, and they get to decide what the public should like or not like. They will hire managers and social media specialists to pump news and controversies, put these new stars to TV shows, create scandals etc etc. Basically any person can be turned into a music star.",0

As for her personality, yes, she has a terrible personality. I have no respect for parents who allow their teenage children to go watch Cardi B. If she was a male, like Bill Cosby or R. Kelly, she would be in jail today (for drugging and assaulting her customers during her prostitution days)",0

Vulgar comes from the Latin “vulgaris”. It means “common”. The common and uneducated. For instance, labor workers, slaves, serfs, poor, peasants, etc. People that aren't common are royalty, lords, the rich, etc. It is called vulgar, because it is not proper. They are those with heavy accents and dialects. They're not conesuers of literature; however, they are the reason language and grammar are fluid and evolving. Hip Hop is arguably the first real voice of the vulgaris. This is who and why it is made. This the essence of Hip Hop.",0

As late as the early 1990s, I used to visit a small town in Mississippi where the black residents were made to live in “the quarters” in homes that amounted to little more than wooden shacks along dirt roads.

McConnell, the Senate majority leader, responded by shooting down Democrats’ efforts to bring two election-security bills to a vote — bills that McConnell, in his familiar fashion, had previously sentenced to quiet deaths after they passed the House. In the hailstorm of opprobrium that followed, McConnell had been tagged by “Morning Joe” Scarborough with the indelible nickname “Moscow Mitch.” The Washington Post’s Dana Milbank called him a “Russian asset.” Twitter couldn’t decide whether he was #putinsbitch or #trumpsbitch.

Fancy Farm, a 139-year tradition in the tiny western Kentucky town (population 458) it’s named for, is simultaneously one of America’s most charming political gatherings and one of its most brutal. On the one hand, it’s a pint-size Iowa State Fair in a prettier setting with better food, raising money for the local St. Jerome’s Catholic Church.

Under a big corrugated shelter, hooting and hollering Republican partisans assemble on the right, Democrats on the left, and candidates for office — joined, almost always, by McConnell — enter to cheers and jeers and seat themselves on a makeshift platform while trying to remember their most cutting quips about their opponents. Speakers at Fancy Farm aren’t supposed to persuade or inform; here, they’re expected to demonstrate, in the finest tradition of old-style Southern politics, that they can deliver zingers that cut the opposition down to size.

He lost in November. Last summer, after months of waving through President Trump’s judicial nominees, McConnell opened his remarks with a typically pointed jab — “Father, I’ve been preparing for my visit to the parish by performing as many confirmations as I can” — then stood back, his thin lips curling up slightly into the look of smug satisfaction that happens whenever he’s gotten one over on the liberals.",0

McConnell has been unpopular in his home state for years, but his approval rating plunged in one poll to a rock-bottom 18 percent — with a re-election campaign looming in 2020. In January, he had raised red flags among Republicans and -Democrats alike when he took a key role in lifting sanctions on Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, a Putin ally under FBI investigation for his involvement in 2016 election-meddling; three months later, Deripaska’s aluminum company, Rusal, announced a $200 million investment in Kentucky.

And as Trump’s trade war with China escalated, uncomfortable old stories began to recirculate about how McConnell “evolved” after he met his future wife in the early Nineties, going from being a fierce China hawk to a potent ally on Capitol Hill. Chao’s father, James — a Chinese American shipping magnate and close friend of former People’s Republic dictator Jiang Zemin — gave McConnell and his wife a huge gift in 2008 that boosted the senator’s net worth from less than $8 million to nearly $20 million. While “Beijing Mitch” doesn’t have quite the same ring as his new moniker, McConnell’s change of heart on Russia was hardly without precedent. (McConnell declined to comment for this story.)",0

When a group of former coal miners suffering from black-lung disease caravaned to Washington to ask the senator for help, he met with them for only two minutes, leading to terrible headlines. As Fancy Farm got underway, coal miners in Harlan County were holding a protest that made news throughout the state. Their company had declared bankruptcy without warning and was refusing to pay their final paychecks, and the miners were blocking the tracks to prevent rail cars from shipping $1 million worth of the coal. As the protest stretched into late August, the site became a 24-hour encampment, attracting activists and food donations from around the country, and was visited by nearly every Kentucky politician except McConnell. Practically every story featured the miners cursing the senator. “He’s not pro-coal,” said miner Collin Cornette. “I don’t even think he’s pro-Kentucky.”",0

Even with a closely contested governor’s race in the offing, most folks came to taunt their senior senator and revel in his troubles. You can’t blame them: For almost four decades, McConnell has been ruthlessly mowing down his opponents with big-money negative campaigns and transforming the GOP into the state’s dominant party. And while many Kentuckians once took pride in having such a mighty mover-and-shaker in Washington, they’ve become increasingly appalled by what he’s done with his power: ensuring that big donors have undue influence in elections, turning Congress into a strictly partisan battlefield, and serving as the indispensable wingman for Trump. The crowd is teeming with Cossack hats and homemade signs with messages like “Putin for senator — cut out the middle man.” Before the speechifying, I run into Bennie J.

But McConnell’s brand of Republicanism — he’d chosen the party because his father fought under Dwight Eisenhower in World War II — was more moderate. Young Mitch was gung-ho for civil rights. In 1963, while an undergraduate, McConnell spoke at a university rally, urging students to join Martin Luther King Jr. in marching to the state capitol. That same year, he wrote an op-ed urging Republicans to eschew the “constitutional” arguments that Barry Goldwater and other conservatives cited as reasons to oppose the Civil Rights Act. “One must view the Constitution as a document adaptable to conditions of contemporary society,” McConnell wrote.

But for the first time, he also showed how willing he would be to cast aside principles. “Forced busing” had recently been imposed by the courts to desegregate Louisville’s public schools, and McConnell ran in opposition to it; the former civil-rights champion was now pandering to white voters’ anxieties and resentments.",0

With their help, McConnell zeroed in on the vulnerabilities of his opponent, Todd Hollenbach. He blew up some minor ethical lapses into darkly ominous controversies. And because Hollenbach was going through a divorce, McConnell’s ads were full of smiling family images of the Republican newcomer, his wife, and his daughters. (McConnell’s first wife, who went on to become a noted feminist scholar, divorced him in 1980.)

McConnell rolled out a tactic he’d use again and again in future campaigns — making his opponent look like more of an outsider than the incumbent from Washington. McConnell had promised reporters he’d be running a purely positive campaign, but he broke that pledge with alacrity. At Fancy Farm in 1989, he lit into Sloane as the “wimp from the East” whose “mommy left him a million dollars” and who had “come down here to save us from ourselves.” (When reporters asked McConnell afterward why he’d already gone negative, he replied, “I just couldn’t help myself.”) Running with generous backing from the NRA, McConnell also painted Sloane as a gun-grabber. McConnell’s campaign sent endless mailers and ran streams of ads turning Sloane’s support for an assault-weapons ban into further evidence that he was an uppity liberal. McConnell, among his many pernicious contributions to American politics, became one of the first to successfully turn the Second Amendment into a cultural wedge issue.

In 1973, not long after he was elected chairman of the Jefferson County Republican Party, he’d written an op-ed for the Courier-Journal calling for “truly effective campaign finance reform” — lowering contribution limits, mandating public disclosure of donors, even capping how much a candidate could spend in a race. He’d later laugh this off, claiming he’d been “playing for headlines” to distract folks from the Watergate scandal. But in 1987, midway through his first term, McConnell floated a constitutional amendment to end what he called the “millionaire’s loophole” — the ability for wealthy Americans to spend limitless money on their own campaigns.",0

He shares a large character flaw with many right wingers right now - just an overall lack of integrity. He advocates for a larger amount of campaign funds in politics because “[he] wants to win.” He blames past democratic administrations for foreign policy blunders in the Mid-East, when it is very much a fallacious standpoint to take to blame the actions of one political party for a complex topic (it’s probably 65%/35%, reps. and dems., respectively). He restricts abortion access (which I agree that abortion is morally wrong) but turns a blind eye to foreign and domestic human rights abuses (Uighur genocide, Rohingya cleansing, U.S. southern border situation). He falsely associates the expansion of the welfare state in the late 70s and early 80s with the socioeconomic disenfranchisement of black and brown communities (c.c. the Iran-Contra Affair, which introduced the drug trade into U.S. urban areas; it was transparently the responsibility of the Reagan administration and was swept under the rug by Bill Barr under Bush 41).

He used every tool in his toolbox, some that may not have passed constitutional muster, but that is for constitutional historians to decide. That was his greatest triumph. His greatest failure was that in refusing to pay for the war, and by expanding the size of government instead of contracting it during wartime, Bush put us on a path that will make it harder to for us to maintain our military and financial supremacy for the long term. His unpopularity also ushered in the presidency of his successor, which has only accelerated this troubling trend. I like George Bush, and I supported him when he was president.

But that doesn’t mean that I can’t look at his presidency with a fresh pair of eyes. Mr. Bush, with his new book, is basically asking us to revisit his tenure. Like most presidents, Mr. Bush had his wins and his losses, and it is really up to the historians to decide whether he was a success or a failure.

Bush was sitting behind his desk in the Oval Office, chewing gum, staring, and listening—in fact listening longer than usual. He did not like long discursive reports. But this one weighed on him. “Do you think he did it? ” Bush asked. “Yeah,” the lawyer said, “I think he did it.” The nation’s forty-third president had just days left in office, and the Decider, as he had memorably dubbed himself, was struggling with one final decision. His vice president, the man who had been at his side through every crisis for eight tumultuous years, was pressing him as never before. For two months, Dick Cheney had been lobbying for a pardon for his former chief of staff, I. Lewis Libby, who was known to all as Scooter and had been convicted of perjury and obstruction of justice in a case that had its roots in the origins of the Iraq War. Cheney would not let it go. He brought it up again and again, to the point that the president did not want to talk with him about it anymore. Bush’s gut told him no pardon, and he usually followed his gut. He had long bristled at the notion of people trading on connections to win executive clemency. The whole pardon process seemed corrupted to him, and now here was the ultimate insider seeking a special favor. Yet how could he tell Cheney no? How could he reject his partner of two terms on the one thing Cheney cared about most? For a man who valued loyalty above almost all else, it cut against the grain. To help make a decision, Bush personally asked White House lawyers to reexamine the case to see if a pardon was justified. Fred Fielding, the White House counsel who had also served in the same role for Ronald Reagan, and William Burck, his deputy who had been a federal prosecutor in New York, pored over trial transcripts and studied evidence that Libby’s lawyers had raised. Now they were in the Oval Office to report back that the jury had ample reason to find Libby guilty.",0
1452858095533703175,Dick Cheney is a demonic pos,"“I don’t know. I wasn’t there,” Burck was saying to Bush, tempering his “he did it” judgment just a bit. “But if I were on that jury, I would probably have agreed with them. You have to follow the law, and the law says if you say something that is untrue, knowingly, to a federal official in the context of a grand jury investigation and it is material to their investigation, that’s a crime.”",0
1452858095533703175,Dick Cheney is a demonic pos,"Libby had been convicted of lying to federal investigators about whether he had divulged to journalists the name of a CIA officer married to a critic of the vice president. Libby insisted he simply remembered events differ- ently from other witnesses. However, his story clashed not just with that of one person but with those of eight other people, including fellow administra- tion officials. To believe Libby, the lawyers concluded, would be to believe that all those other people were wrong in their recollections or that Libby’s memory was so faulty that he did not remember repeated conversations about a topic that clearly consumed the office of the vice president. “All right, all right,” the president said finally, which his aides took to mean he would not grant the pardon. “So why do you think he did it? Do you think he was protecting the vice president? ” “I don’t think he was protecting the vice president,” Burck said. “So why do you think he did it? ” Bush asked. Burck said he thought Libby assumed his account of events would never be contradicted because prosecutors would not force reporters to violate vows of confidentiality to their sources. “I think he thought that would never be broken, and I think also Libby was concerned because he took to heart what you said back then, which is that you would fire anybody that you knew was involved in this,” Burck said. “I just think he didn’t think it was worth falling on the sword.” Bush took that in but did not seem convinced. “I think he still thinks he was protecting Cheney,” the president said. He did not say so, but it seemed that Bush believed that Cheney had a personal stake in this, that in effect it was a conflict of interest. Now the vice president was just one more sup- plicant trading on personal connections in the pardon process, in this case seeking forgiveness for the man who had sacrificed himself for Cheney. Bush sighed. “Now I am going to have to have the talk with the vice president,” he said gloomily. That was the sort of unpleasant business that for eight years he had left to Cheney. It was the vice president who had deliv- ered the bad news to people like Paul O’Neill and Donald Rumsfeld when they were fired. Bolten spoke up. “I can do it,” he volunteered. “Nah, nah, I can do it,” Bush said.",0
1452858095533703175,Dick Cheney is a demonic pos,"FOR EIGHT YEARS, George Walker Bush and Richard Bruce Cheney had been partners in an ambitious joint venture to remake the country and the world. No two Americans in public office had collaborated to such lasting effect since Richard M. Nixon and Henry Kissinger.",0
1452858095533703175,Dick Cheney is a demonic pos,"Together they had accomplished significant things. They lifted a nation wounded by sneak attack on September 11, 2001, and safeguarded it from further assault, putting in place a new national security architecture for a dangerous era that would endure after they left office. At home, they insti- tuted sweeping changes in education, health care, and taxes while heading off another Great Depression and the collapse of the storied auto industry. Abroad, they liberated fifty million people from despotic governments in the Middle East and central Asia, gave voice to the aspirations of democracy around the world, and helped turn the tide against a killer disease in Africa. They confronted crisis after crisis, not just a single “day of fire” on that bright morning in September, but days of fire over eight years. Yet for all that, their misjudgments and misadventures left them the most unpopular president and vice president in generations. They had unwit- tingly unleashed forces that led to the deaths of perhaps a hundred thousand Iraqis while squandering America’s moral authority, failing to rescue a great American city from a biblical flood, presiding over the worst financial crisis in eight decades, and leaving behind a fiscal mess that would hobble the country for years. For good or ill, theirs was a deeply consequential admin- istration that would test a country and play out long after the two men at its center exited the public stage. That their final hours together would be consumed by their private argument over the pardon underscores the distance the two men had trav- eled. Theirs is a story that may seem familiar on the surface, but in fact the real tale of Bush and Cheney and their eight years together is far more com- plicated than the simplistic narrative that developed over time. Hundreds of interviews with key players, including Cheney, and thousands of pages of never-released notes, memos, and other internal documents paint a rivet- ing portrait of a partnership that evolved dramatically over time. Even in the early days, when a young, untested president relied on the advice of his seasoned number two, Bush was hardly the pawn nor Cheney the puppeteer that critics imagined. But if the vice president won most of the fights in the first term, he had grown increasingly marginalized by the second. Restless and disaffected, Bush sought out new paths to right his presidency and no longer paid as much heed to his vice president on everything from North Korea to gun rights. Cheney became alienated sitting in his West Wing office watching their efforts in his view run off course, undermining much of what he had accomplished. His fight for Libby was in a sense, then, a fight for redemption from a president who had turned away from him. In pressing for clemency, Cheney was seeking one last validation of their extraordinary tandem—one that Bush was ultimately unwilling to give.",0
1452858095533703175,Dick Cheney is a demonic pos,"“Friendship” is a word that does not fully capture the relationship between Bush and Cheney. They did not see each other out of the work- place. Cheney did not spend social weekends at Camp David, and they did not dine together with their wives. They did not typically exchange birthday gifts. Bush did not go hunting with Cheney, and the vice president visited the president’s ranch in Texas only for official meetings, although the two men would occasionally slip out to fish for bass in a pond on the property. On election night in 2000 and again in 2004, they watched the returns sepa- rately, coming together only late in the evening when they thought they were about to head to a public party to claim victory. “They weren’t personally close,” reflected Ari Fleischer, the president’s first White House press secre- tary. “They didn’t go bowling together or to Camp David. Cheney didn’t go jogging with George Bush. He was everything that Bush designed when he chose Dick Cheney to be counselor.” Cheney thought of their relationship as a business one. “It was profes- sional, more than personal,” Cheney said after leaving office. “We weren’t buddies in that sense.” Bush had a hard time defining their relationship. “You know, I would, I would say friends,” he finally concluded. “But on the other hand, we run in separate circles. Dick goes home to his family, and I go home to mine. I wouldn’t call him a very social person. I’m certainly not a very social person either. So we don’t spend a lot of time socially together. But, uh, friends.” Partners might be a more apt description, although even that is freighted. Some Bush advisers objected because in their view partnership implied an equal footing, and the vice president was, in the end, the vice president. Cheney never forgot that and made a point of showing nothing but deference to Bush. While Bush called him “Dick,” Cheney always called Bush “Mr. President.” Even out of his presence, Cheney referred to him as “the Man,” as in “Let’s take this to the Man.” Bush, more irreverently, sometimes referred to Cheney as “Vice.” Karl Rove came to call Cheney “Management,” as in “Better check with Management.” Cheney was just five years Bush’s senior but carried himself with the gravitas of a much older man, and Bush treated him with more respect than anyone else in the inner circle. Yet in any meeting, it was clear who was in charge: Bush led the discussion, asked the questions, and called on people to speak, while Cheney largely remained quiet. “If you spent any time around",0
1452858095533703175,Dick Cheney is a demonic pos,"President Bush, you quickly realize he’s not a guy who can be led around in that way, not at all,” observed Matthew Dowd, his campaign strategist. “And Cheney’s not the type who operates that way, not at all.” Still, that silence seemed to connote a power all its own; everyone else in the room under- stood that when they left, Cheney stayed behind, offering advice one-on- one when nobody could rebut him. What Cheney actually thought, at times, remained mysterious. “He was a black box to a lot of us,” said Peter Wehner, the White House director of strategic initiatives.",0
1452858095533703175,Dick Cheney is a demonic pos,"They were, of course, starkly different men, Bush an outgoing former college cheerleader from a privileged family background who delighted in bestowing nicknames, conquered his own demons with a ferocious midlife discipline, and preferred the big picture; Cheney a onetime electrical line- man who worked his way up to some of the most important jobs in Wash- ington by mastering the intricacies of governance, ultimately becoming the grim eminence of a wartime White House. But they shared more in their backgrounds than many recognized. Both were raised in the West and identified with its frontier spirit. Both made their way east to the halls of Yale University, only to become disenchanted by what they found to be an elitist culture. Both partied robustly as young men and had run-ins with the law, only to get their acts together after the women in their lives finally put their feet down. Both admired Winston Churchill to the point of displaying busts of the legendary prime minister, seeking to emulate his relentless strength in the face of overwhelming odds. They both had a sense of humor too, though of markedly different brands. Where Bush was jocular and sometimes goofy, making faces on his campaign plane or enjoying an aide’s whoopee cushion prank, Cheney was dry and understated, slipping in an ironic comment and then lifting the corner of his mouth into his trademark crooked grin. As it happened, they shared the same target for their humor: Cheney. Bush enjoyed poking fun at his vice president’s bad aim and penchant for secrecy. “Dick here sent over a gift I could tell he’d picked out personally,” Bush said when his daughter Jenna got engaged to be married. “A paper shredder.” Cheney embraced his own dark reputation. Once his friend David Hume Kennerly greeted him teasingly by saying, “Hi, Dick. Have you blown away any small countries this morning? ” Without missing a beat, Cheney replied, “You know, that’s the one thing about this job I really love.” At one point, he puckishly tried on a Darth Vader mask his aides had bought and posed for a picture. When Cheney later tried to put the picture in his memoir, Lynne Cheney talked him out of it. Popular mythology had Cheney using the dark side of the force to manipulate a weak-minded president into doing his bidding. The image took on such power that books were written about “the co-presidency” and “the hijacking of the American presidency.” Late-night comedians regularly turned to the same theme. Conan O’Brien joked that Cheney had told an interviewer, “I’ll really miss being president.” Jimmy Kimmel joked that Cheney “doesn’t regret any of the decisions he made, and if he had to do it all over again, he would order President Bush to do exactly the same thing.” Cheney did not seem to mind, but it got under Bush’s skin. When he published his own memoir after leaving office, Bush disclosed that Cheney had volunteered to drop off the 2004 election ticket. “Accepting Dick’s offer,” Bush mused, “would be one way to demonstrate that I was in charge.” Yet while Bush stewed, Cheney came to see the reputation as an advantage. “Am I the evil genius in the corner that nobody ever sees come out of his hole? ” he once asked sardonically. “It’s a nice way to operate, actually.”",0
1452858095533703175,Dick Cheney is a demonic pos,"The cartoonish caricature, however, overstated the reality and missed the fundamental path of the relationship. Cheney was unquestionably the most influential vice president in American history. He assembled a power base through a mastery of how Washington worked and a relationship of trust with Bush, who viewed him as his consigliere guiding him through a hostile and bewildering capital. Cheney subordinated himself to Bush in a way no other vice president in modern times had done, forgoing any inde- pendent aspiration to run for president himself in order to focus entirely on making Bush’s presidency successful. In return, Bush gave him access to every meeting and decision, a marked contrast to his predecessors. Harry Truman as vice president met alone with Franklin D. Roosevelt just twice after Inauguration Day. When asked in 2002 how many times he had met privately with Bush, Cheney reached into his suit pocket and pulled out his schedule. “Let me see,” he said. “Three, four, five, six, seven—seven times.” Then he paused for effect. “Today.” As a result, Cheney played an outsized role in driving decisions in the early years of the administration, expertly employing a network of loyalists placed strategically throughout the government. When he ran into opposi- tion, Cheney instituted controversial environmental, energy, and counter- terrorism policies by circumventing the internal process. He pressed, and even badgered, an inexperienced president to go after Saddam Hussein in Iraq over any reservations Bush might have harbored. “Are you going to take care of this guy or not? ” Cheney demanded impatiently at one of their private lunches. For all that, Cheney was largely pushing on an open door, taking Bush where the president himself was already inclined to go. The president’s clos- est friends and advisers do not recall him ever complaining that Cheney had convinced him to do something he would not have done otherwise. “He never did anything in his time serving George W. that George W. didn’t either sanction or approve of,” said Alan Simpson, a former Republican sena- tor from Wyoming and a close friend of Cheney’s. “So when people say that Cheney was running the show, that is bullshit.” General Richard Myers, who as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was on hand for some of the most critical moments, agreed. “This whole notion that the vice president was the puppet master I find laughable,” he said. “He was an active vice president because I think he was empowered, but he wasn’t a dominant factor. The alpha male in the White House was the president.”",0
1452858095533703175,Dick Cheney is a demonic pos,"Even in the first term, Bush rebuffed Cheney on more than one occa- sion. While agreeing to confront Iraq, Bush refused to attack in the spring of 2002, when Cheney first pushed him to do so, nearly a year before the eventual invasion. He accepted Colin Powell’s recommendation to first seek UN support and rejected a plan to create a post-Hussein government led by Iraqi exiles like Ahmad Chalabi. By the second term, Bush had moved even further away from Cheney. Frustrated by the failure to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and the crescendo of violence that greeted the “libera- tors,” unhappy to find the United States isolated from its allies, and eager for breakthroughs that would shape his legacy, Bush increasingly turned not to his vice president but to Condoleezza Rice, who as secretary of state sup- planted Cheney as the president’s most influential lieutenant. That’s not to say he was neutered. Cheney managed to preserve much of what he had started. But he was on defense more than offense in the second term, trying to fend off changes that he thought would weaken the coun- try or unravel the policies he had brought to pass. “Perhaps my clout was diminished,” he conceded after leaving office. “That’s possible. I wouldn’t quarrel about that.” Indeed, by the time Bush and Cheney stepped out of the White House for the final time, they had disagreed on North Korea, gun rights, same-sex marriage, tax cuts, Guantánamo Bay, interrogation prac- tices, surveillance policy, Iran, the auto industry bailout, climate change, the Lebanon War, Harriet Miers, Donald Rumsfeld, Middle East peace, Syria, Russia, and federal spending. All of that came before the Scooter Libby pardon. THE VICE PRESIDENT'S lobbying campaign started in earnest after the 2008 election that picked their successors. With the final weeks of the administra- tion now at hand, Cheney decided he would invest whatever fading capital he had left in winning a pardon for his onetime right-hand man. To Cheney, it was simple justice. Libby had been pursued by an unprin- cipled prosecutor bent on damaging the White House. Neither Libby nor anyone else had been charged with the leak that precipitated the investiga- tion in the first place, and it turned out the special prosecutor had known virtually from the start that someone else had been the original source. The fact that the prosecutor kept investigating anyway made Cheney feel that he was the real target and Libby collateral damage. In the end, he felt, the charges against Libby were built on nothing more than a faulty memory. Libby had loyally served Cheney and Bush, and for that matter his country, only to be made into a criminal.",0
1452858095533703175,Dick Cheney is a demonic pos,"Cheney brought up the case incessantly. In eight years, he had never pushed Bush as hard on any other matter. Cheney raised it with Bush dur- ing a meeting before a Thanksgiving round of pardons, then again before a Christmas round. Bush told Cheney he would hold off more controversial pardons until near the end of their term, a comment the vice president took as an indication that Libby would be among them. But Bush never believed he had made any commitment, and he was skeptical of a pardon from the start. He had already commuted Libby’s prison sentence after it was handed down in 2007 so the former aide never had to spend a minute behind bars. But at the time, Fred Fielding had written a public statement for Bush saying he was not substituting his judgment for the jury’s on the question of guilt or innocence. How could he change his mind two years later? That was the argument Cheney heard from Ed Gillespie, the presiden- tial counselor and top political adviser who came to see the vice president one day to explain why he was advising Bush against a pardon. As with many in the White House, the Libby case had proved personally painful for Gil- lespie. He had been among the first to contribute to Libby’s legal defense fund. But given what Bush had said in commuting the sentence, Gillespie told Cheney he did not think the president should now grant a full pardon. “On top of that, Mr. Vice President, the lawyers are not making the case for it,” Gillespie said. “We’ll be asked, did the lawyers recommend it? And if the lawyers didn’t, it’s going to be hard to justify for the president.” Cheney said he thought Gillespie was wrong and shared his views about why the prosecution was illegitimate. The two agreed to disagree, and Gil- lespie got up and left after what he thought was the hardest thing he had had to do while in the White House. THE CONTROVERSY THAT surrounded Cheney’s role invited a question that would mark his time in office: Had he changed? What happened to the sensible, moderate Republican people thought they knew? Brent Scowcroft, who had served as national security adviser to two Republican presidents, famously said he no longer recognized his friend. Others wondered whether the vice president had somehow been affected by his multiple heart attacks or by the trauma of September 11, 2001.",0
1452858095533703175,Dick Cheney is a demonic pos,"Perhaps so many thought he had changed because they mistook his low-key demeanor, friendships across party lines, and service for moderate presidents as indications that he was more moderate than he really was. The record suggests he was always more conservative than his reputation. In Gerald R. Ford’s White House, he was at odds with Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and Vice President Nelson Rockefeller. In Congress during the 1980s, he compiled one of the most conservative voting records; when the Washington Post referred to him as a moderate, Cheney instructed an aide to call for a correction. As defense secretary for George H. W. Bush, he was deeply suspicious of the reformist Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. After all this, Cheney scoffed at the notion that he was any different than he had been as a young man. “I didn’t change,” he said. “The world changed.” Having participated in doomsday war-game scenarios in the 1980s map- ping out the consequences of catastrophic attack, Cheney had long nursed dark views about the world’s dangers, views that seemed ratified on Septem- ber 11. He spent the rest of his time in office consumed not with another September 11 but with a much worse scenario where terrorists would be armed with nuclear or chemical weapons instead of box cutters. By the end of his tenure, the country had largely forgotten its fears from the days after the World Trade Center fell, but Cheney had not. What happened on Sep- tember 11 was a wrenching tragedy, but ultimately survivable for a nation; an attack with weapons of mass destruction could pose a much more exis- tential threat. In that view, almost anything it took to protect the country seemed justified. While some Americans began thinking they had overre- acted to September 11, Cheney lived in the shadowy world of intelligence reports that projected threats around every corner, the “dark side,” as he memorably put it. What was the moral cost of waterboarding three terrorists against the chance of a mushroom cloud in Manhattan? If anything transformed, it was Cheney’s public persona. “He went from the wise man, the Yoda character, to Colonel Jessup from A Few Good Men,” said Adam Levine, who worked in the White House in the first term. Levine then channeled Cheney as the gravelly voiced Jack Nicholson playing the you-can’t-handle-the-truth colonel lecturing the lawyer played by Tom Cruise on a rough-and-tumble world: “ ‘You want me on that wall. Who is going to do it? You, Colin Powell? You, Condi Rice? I don’t have the time or inclination to explain myself to somebody who rises and sleeps under the blanket of freedom I provide and then questions the manner in which I provide it.’ Cheney embodied that feeling of it—‘I don’t have to fucking explain to you what I am doing. I am saving the country, you asshole. I am saving lives. As much as you might hate me, you need me here.’ Bush was never like that.”",0
1452858095533703175,Dick Cheney is a demonic pos,"From the days after September 11 at least, it was Cheney who did not change. He remained focused unwaveringly on the threat he perceived. It was Bush who changed, not in his core beliefs or his general personality, but in his approach toward the same goals. By the latter half of his presidency, he had grown more confident in his own judgments and less dependent on his vice president. He was willing to compromise on his most controversial terror policies in order to build a bipartisan foundation that would outlast his administration. He was more interested in rebuilding alliances and trying diplomacy than in preemptive wars. Condoleezza Rice, the architect of the shift, said Bush viewed it not as a sharp pivot but as more of a natural evolu- tion along a continuum following the necessarily aggressive actions of the first term. “We had broken a lot of china,” she reflected. “But at that point, you have to leave something in place. That is true with allies. It is true with the Middle East. It is true in putting together an international consensus on North Korea and international consensus on Iran. And I don’t think that is how the vice president saw it. I think he would have liked to have kept breaking china.” Bush and Cheney headed into their final months in office resigned to their differences. Bush remained respectful of his number two and was rarely heard to utter a disparaging word, although there were occasions when he was known to roll his eyes at something Cheney did or said. Cheney seemed tired, perhaps physically spent after four heart attacks on his way to a fifth and politically spent after eight years in the trenches. When it came to one of the last major foreign policy decisions of the administration—what to do about a secret Syrian nuclear reactor—Cheney’s isolation was made plain when he urged an American air strike. “Does anyone here agree with the vice president? ” Bush asked at the critical meeting. Not a single hand went up. A few weeks before the inauguration, even as Cheney was lobbying Bush for the Libby pardon, Joshua Bolten invited all of his living prede- cessors as chief of staff to his West Wing office to meet with his successor, Rahm Emanuel. Thirteen of the sixteen men to have served in that unique role attended, including Cheney, who had been Ford’s top assistant. They went around one by one to offer advice. When it came to Cheney, a devilish look crossed his face. “Whatever you do,” he said, pausing for effect, “make sure you’ve got the vice president under control.”",0

Perhaps the most damning thing that can be said is that, when the prime minister claims he was unaware, as a 29-year-old teacher in 2001, that dressing up as a member of a racial minority was offensive — that, in fact, it did not dawn on him until after he was elected as an MP, in 2008 — most of us believe him.

1452783359990513667,Justin Trudeau is a racist piece of work and should lose his job over his black face debacle.,"It was classic Trudeau: the melody may be one of contrition, but the words are all deflection. The failing was not personal or individual, he implied, a product of his own narcissism and staggering incuriousness. Rather, the fault lay with the “privilege” that had blinded him, and presumably others of his class and race — few of whom would even think of dressing in blackface. And thus to an extended homily on the lessons we must all learn, the work we must all do — and that he pledged to lead — to defeat the scourge of racism. Nearby members of the public broke into spontaneous applause. If you thought this affair meant an end to the Trudeau brand of conspicuous moral preening — if you thought the rank hypocrisy of lecturing his opponents for their sins against tolerance, even as he was concealing much worse in his past, would deter or even shame him — think again. He seems merely to have exchanged one hypocrisy for another, asking meekly for the forgiveness he has been so unwilling to extend to others.",0

It isn’t the insensitivity, or the self-absorption, or the hypocrisy, that will leave the most lasting impression: it’s the calculation, the fakery, the synthetic emotion, the sly manipulation. The prime minister has proved adept at deploying the jargon and cliches of the identitarian left (“microaggressions,” “intersectionalities,” and “ally” all featured highly in the Winnipeg press conference) in moments of maximum political danger: recall his earlier non-denial of having groped a young female reporter, this time as a 28-year-old: “men and women often experience situations differently.” Is he a racist? No. He is a fraud. The racial masks he wore to conceal his identity 20 years ago are but one in a series: from blackface to feministface to sunnywaysface. If it were just a matter of comparing his youthful errors to his record on racial issues, his partisans might have a point. Certainly the Conservatives, with their record of having exploited fears of Muslims, or asylum-seekers, or God help us, the Global Migration Compact, are in no position to point fingers.",0

It informs every part of his record, the whole of his platform. The leader we saw dissembling so skillfully this week in Winnipeg is the same one who lied to the public, repeatedly, about the SNC-Lavalin affair; who made solemn and explicit promises on electoral reform and balanced budgets he had no intention of keeping; who ran roughshod over Parliament in exactly the same ways he had most decried in his predecessor. Oh, and: he is the same leader who boasted after the fact of having personally selected a “scrappy tough-guy senator from an Indigenous community” as his opponent for the charity boxing match that would launch his career because he would make “a good foil.” Even on race, that the current occupant of the Prime Minister’s Office is a sanctimonious fraud it is surely at least as significant as that his government sponsors anti-racism seminars.",0

Even I can play better football than that little man,"Renowned as part of the fearsome MSN trident, the Brazilian starred in Lucho’s side. While I will expand slightly on Messi’s interesting role later, the front three in general experienced great freedom under Enrique. As mentioned in a previous answer, Lucho’s failure to recapture the Positional Play of tactical genius Pep Guardiola was not necessarily an issue when the team possessed both supreme technical quality and qualitative superiority in the form of MSN. It is probable that a better game controlling, positionally rigorous playing style would have stifled the output of the front three as their movements would be less spontaneous. As such, Neymar harnessed his combination play and tactical collective abilities to devastating effect. With Messi’s goal in the Roma game a prime example, MSN was a beauty to behold and the idea that Neymar- at least at the time-was a soloist is far from the truth.",0
1452753299933777923,@PSGprotector @iMiaSanMia Neymar is trash. Even I can play better football than that little man,"The interactions on the left side between him, Iniesta and Alba were also fruitful. His prodigious dribbling abilities came into play as part of those interactions- having successfully completed an average of 4 dribbles per game in his 4 seasons in La Liga; Alba would often provide direct runs into depth when Neymar cut inside onto his right foot and Iniesta would either look to create from deep or simultaneously balance the other two’s movements with more vertical support in the left halfspace. While Neymar and Alba never quite formed the synergistic, intricate relationship of Messi and Alves- both flanks were extremely potent in their individual quality and potential for asymmetrical movements.",0
1452753299933777923,@PSGprotector @iMiaSanMia Neymar is trash. Even I can play better football than that little man,"From looking at interviews concerning Enrique and Messi as well as the way in which games transpire, the Argentine magician enjoyed not only positional but great tactical liberty under the Spaniard in order to best dictate on the field the way in which offensively his side could penetrate the opposition. As such, it would be natural to minimise the defensive workrate of Messi and let him conserve energy to be more lethal in attacking situations. This is where Neymar comes in. His underrated willigness (or acceptance, depending on your view) to drop in and tuck next to Iniesta would create a situational 442 where Messi would have a second striker position near to Suarez. Out of this, narrowness and compactness could be attained and 4141 pressing using a central midfielder pressing out towards a centre back (a la Guardiola) was possible. This is a feature of Neymar’s playing style that meant he was critical in situations when Barcelona required greater halfspace presence in counterpressing and establishing dominance in central areas.",0

1452753299933777923,@PSGprotector @iMiaSanMia Neymar is trash. Even I can play better football than that little man,"Now at PSG, Neymar joined another fearsome trident in the form of MCN. Mbappe, Cavani and Neymar like MSN possess superior individual quality to the majority of teams that they face. And one thing that is apparent about this three pronged offense is their frightening counterattack. Cavani’s athleticism and involvement in build up, Neymar’s speed and dribbling ability and Mbappe’s searing pace combined with astute tactical movement mean that the latter two can often bounce pass off of Cavani to attain the ball at a higher speed with a better dynamic advantage or look to destabilise a transitioning defence with manipulative individual dribbles. These strategies were deployed to great effect against Bayern in the 3–0 UCL win last season where the front three’s supremacy convincingly won the day rather than the team as whole.",0
1452753299933777923,@PSGprotector @iMiaSanMia Neymar is trash. Even I can play better football than that little man,"But in stark contrast to his time in Spain, Neymar (Mbappe too) displayed inconsistent and generally insipid defensive workrate. A narrow front three leaves wide areas unattended and instigates a chain reaction whereby the 8s either leave the full backs exposed or push out to compensate for the lack of compactness provided by the forwards and leave their 6 (DM) exposed. Teams with heavy wing focus can be pressed and their crosses inundated by physical superiority; but within Europe, PSG have been exposed time and again by structural flaws like this one. I don’t think it’s coincidental that 3 of the 5 goals that PSG conceded in their two legged tie against Real came from crosses against a team that like to establish a cycle of dominance whereby build up is extremely wing orientated.",0
1452753299933777923,@PSGprotector @iMiaSanMia Neymar is trash. Even I can play better football than that little man,"However, I think the clinching factor is his attitude. Neymar completed over 7 dribbles per 90 in both Ligue 1 and the UCL last season compared to between 4 and 6 for virtually every competition he played in at Barcelona. While you might argue a certain Lionel Messi has something to do with that, his total dribbles per 90 have risen sharply every season from 2013/14 to 2017/18. In a similar fashion to Ronaldo seemingly reacting to frustration by shooting excessively, dribbling seems to be Neymar’s ‘outlet.’ His egocentric, narcissistic persona has been epitomised by his behaviour towards other teammates. While tensions simmer between Mbappe and Neymar, a power struggle has been apparent between the Brazilian and Cavani. Their puerile confrontation over taking penalties saw not only a public spat during a game and a supposed fight afterwards in the dressing room- but Neymar also deny the Uruguayan the chance to become the club’s all time topscorer in a 8–0 demolition of Dijon.",0

Again, one could argue the traumatic nature of the Zuniga-inflicted injury in 2014 compelled the Brazilian to act in such a self-protective manner where he would present himself as vulnerable. But he did not endear himself to the general footballing public and the fact that he was probably rushed back from a metatarsal injury sustained against Marseille in February has been glossed over. Instead, people focus on the ‘paltry’ 2 goals and assist he attained in 5 games and the fact that he spent around 14 minutes on the ground during the tournament.",0

I would argue that his role at Barcelona is understated, particularly from a defensive standpoint and would also suggest that the upturn in offensive output is as much a reflection of his individual quality as it is the standard of Ligue 1 with 1.6 goal contributions per 90. However, I think Neymar’s biggest downfall is the culture and hegemony of PSG and thus intensifies the scrutiny which is received because it seems that the Brazilian calls the shots and as such is the main source of blame for anything and everything that goes wrong in his team.",0

In fact, he has great vision and is a pretty stellar passer. I just think he needs to allow the game to come to him, because he absolutely has the quality to deliver in those moments when it does.

With that said, it’s not difficult to see that you don’t want him to be the best player if you are building a UCL favorite. He’s a slight negative to the team in terms of overall leadership—not because he’s a bad person but because he’s just really reactive and seems easily distracted because he can’t let anything go. He reminds me of Mourinho in that way. Your best player has to be a solid plus in this respect, helping the team focus on what matters.",1

He will never track back or put his body on the line if the situation demands. With that talent he could have been even better but moving to PSG was a step down. He will surely has his moments but there is a very slim possibility of him becoming better than what he is. I may be wrong but for now that's the only judgment I'll hold of him.,1

1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,"Piers Morgan is angry. Even by his puce-faced standards, he is fuming. The Good Morning Britain (GMB) presenter, Twitter bruiser (7.6 million followers and counting, as he will frequently remind you) and frenemy of Donald Trump is waging war on woke. “Wokery has been hijacked by extremely illiberal people bordering on fascist – ironically given how much they hate fascism,” he tells me while shadow boxing invisible foes.",0
1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,"We’re in a dressing room at Television Centre in west London, from where GMB is broadcast. Morgan is having his photo taken and letting rip. Liberal fascists are taking over the world, he says; John Locke, the father of liberalism, will be spinning in his enlightened grave. The very folk once renowned for their tolerance are now shutting down opinion like there is no tomorrow. And, if it goes on like this, Morgan thinks there may well be no tomorrow. You want examples of fascist wokery? He’ll give you examples, all right.",0
1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,"There is the fascist transgender lobby, who won’t accept that trans women are different from biological women; the fascist feministas who won’t accept trans women are women full stop; the fascist killjoys who scream “Sexist!” when Morgan tells GMB’s weather presenter, Laura Tobin, that she looks hot in her tight, red, fake-leather trousers; the fascist students who no-platform everyone who offends their snowflake sensibilities; the fascist gloomsters trying to cancel classic comedy shows; the fascist language police who remade “mankind” as “peoplekind”; the fascist celebs who fly thousands of miles to environmental conferences in private jets to order us to become carbon neutral.",0
1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,And he has barely started. Don’t forget the fascist former royals who boycott the press while milking it for all it is worth; the fascist remoaners who won’t accept Brexit; the fascist Trump haters who won’t acknowledge any of the president’s achievements; the fascist vegan army who force-feed us kale and meatless sausage rolls. And – perhaps wokeness at its very worst – the fascist toy manufacturer that has blacked up our beloved Wombles as a pathetic act of political correctness. Angry? You bet he is.,0
1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,"And knackered. It is 9.30am; he has just done a three-hour stint on TV and has been up since 2.30am. “Whenever there’s a really big story, I can’t sleep. It’s adrenaline. This whole year has reminded me of running the Mirror during the big stories.” Today’s big story is that Trump has been discharged from hospital and is telling the US not to be scared of Covid-19. Morgan is trending on Twitter for tearing a strip off Trump while also saying they may still be friends. Another example of the liberal fascists – why should the two be mutually exclusive, he says.",0
1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,"The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines woke as “aware of and actively attentive to important facts and issues (especially issues of racial and social justice)”. Nothing wrong with that, you might think. But Morgan says the word has been corrupted. He prefers his own definition: “Woke means being constantly self-righteously certain that your ultraliberal, virtue-signalling opinion is not only always right but anyone who disagrees is an idiot.” It’s funny, I say – take away the ultraliberal virtue-signalling bit and you could be talking about yourself. “Yeah! I am absolutely prone to self-righteous outbursts and thinking I’m right. The difference is I’m happy to have debate.” It’s true. We spend the next two and a half hours doing just that.",0
1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,"Morgan’s new book, Wake Up: Why The World Has Gone Nuts, is a fast, entertaining read. He has a point – society has become increasingly polarised in recent years and cancel culture is terrifying – although many of his targets are paper tigers or simply ludicrous. Morgan, 55, says debate has to become more open and nuanced: “Stephen Fry said you don’t change the opinions of arseholes by behaving like an even bigger arsehole.” But isn’t he guilty of that? “Yes. And when I’ve waged various campaigns, I very rarely win. The louder you scream and the less you cross the divide and sit with your opponents, the less you achieve.” He is still learning and evolving, he says. “Contrary to public myth, I’ve never actually thought I’m perfect, even if I’ve conveyed that impression.”",0
1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,"Does he ever give himself a headache? “Yes!” And does he ever shut up? “Yeah. At home, I’m very quiet.”",0
1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,"At the beginning of the book, Morgan says these battles have been fought largely on social media, primarily Twitter. He points out that only 20% of British and American people use Twitter; of those, 10% post 80% of tweets. In other words, we are talking about a tiny bubble. If he finds the tone so upsetting, wouldn’t the simple thing be to get off the platform? He grins. “Yes, but I like it. My problem is I like combative debate with people and I like going after people and I like people coming after me. I thrive off that.”",0
1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,"Rather than no-platforming, Morgan does the opposite. He invites people with views he can’t stand on to GMB so he can annihilate them. But that simply fuels the culture wars. Last year, the journalist Benjamin Butterworth came on the show to defend the notion that there are 100 genders. Morgan ridiculed him, claiming he identified as a two-spirit penguin. It felt as if he was punching down.",0
1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,"“Hang on, hang on, get your ducks in a row,” he says pugnaciously. “He had signed a petition to have me fired. He was trying to cancel me. That’s why I gave him a hard time. And did he win that argument or did he make himself look a bit ridiculous? I think he made himself look a bit ridiculous.”",0
1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,"Maybe, but so did Morgan, who was reduced to mimicking Butterworth’s voice. When I mention it, he looks as close to contrite as I have ever seen him. “To be honest, I regret that. That actually does stray into being a bit of a bully. You lose the argument when you do that. You’re right.”",0
1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,"Morgan’s Twitter bio is a quote from his grandmother, Margot Barber: “One day you’re cock of the walk, the next a feather duster.” It is a perfect summary of Morgan’s yo-yo career, although he has never remained a feather duster for long. Piers Stefan Pughe-Morgan, who grew up in Sussex, joined the Sun in his early 20s, dropped his double-barrelled name and ran the showbusiness column Bizarre. At 28, he was made editor of the News of the World; by 30, he was editing the Daily Mirror.",0
1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,Morgan had a great run as editor of the Mirror – it was a lively red-top ferociously opposed to the Iraq war – then it all ended in disgrace. He was sacked in 2004 for running photos of alleged Iraq war atrocities committed by British forces that he couldn’t stand up. The newspaper later apologised under the headline “Sorry … we were hoaxed”.,0
1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,"He went from newspapers to TV, judging Britain’s Got Talent and its American version. In 2008, he won the first series of Celebrity Apprentice in the US, hosted by Trump. In 2011, he replaced the legendary talkshow host Larry King on CNN. Three years later, Piers Morgan Live was axed. Since then, he has been omnipresent on British TV, presenting GMB, the documentary series Killer Women With Piers Morgan and Piers Morgan’s Life Stories.",0
1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,"Morgan has a planet-sized ego, but unlike Trump he is not a pathological narcissist. That is what makes him fascinating: he is self-aware. Nor is he content to be a reactionary old git. He is not approaching his attack on wokery as a steel-toe-capped rightwinger, he insists. “I’m a liberal to my bootstraps. I ran the Daily Mirror for 10 years.” But he says he is horrified by what he is seeing. He talks about the vitriol aimed at JK Rowling after she mocked an article referring to “people who menstruate” rather than women. “Are we really at the stage where JK Rowling, one of the most woke people you could ever meet, ends up being a hashtag #RIPJKRowling? That’s horrendous.”",0
1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,"But his attack on wokeness goes way beyond JK Rowling. Take mental health, for example. He thinks that encouraging people to talk about it turns us all into bleating wimps. “It’s OK to man up. It doesn’t have to be a shameful thing to say, which makes people want to go off and kill themselves. Life is bloody tough. It comes back to the Rocky Balboa quote: ‘It’s not how many times you’re hit, it’s how many times you get knocked over and pick yourselves up.’ And I think that’s what life is.”",0
1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,"It can seem incredibly insensitive, I say. “I’m not trying to diminish people who have things like clinical depression. I interviewed Alastair Campbell this week. I know how serious that has been for him and his family, but I do think there is a massive difference between that and general life anxieties.” He suggests that we should distinguish clearly between mental illness and mental health. “Mental illness is a clinically diagnosed thing. Mental illness can be classified and treated. But right now everybody is being encouraged to think they are mentally ill in one way or another.”",0
1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,"What he really hates is victim culture – rewarding people for failure. He talks about giving schoolchildren a participation prize for coming last. “What message does that send kids, telling them they’ll never lose in life? When I got fired from the Mirror, I didn’t get a participation prize. I just got humiliated, shamed and sent home. They even asked for my fax machine back. There’s a real world out there, Simon.”",0
1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,"Morgan has four children: three boys from his first marriage, one daughter from his second, to the journalist Celia Walden – the daughter of the former Tory minister George Walden – whom he married in 2010. In the book, he writes: “If you came last in a race on sports day, you won nothing but well-deserved ignominy and ridicule.” If he had a child who always came last, would he feel differently? He looks slightly embarrassed. “I did say to my kids from the day they were born: ‘I’ll never criticise you if you give 100%.’”",0
1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,"And so to Trump. Morgan has been damning of the US president’s handling of the pandemic. In April, he wrote a MailOnline article that began “Shut the f**k up, President Trump”. Trump unfollowed him on Twitter within 24 hours.",0
1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,"Many people ask why it took you so long to condemn him, I say. Ah, there we go again, he responds – typical wokeys, refusing to recognise that Trump rescued the US economy pre-pandemic, took decisive trade action against China, forged a relationship with North Korea. Yes, I say, but they would not praise that, because they had already written him off as a racist, a misogynist and a liar. “I’ve never seen Trump be racist when I’ve been around him,” he says. “What he does is pander to racists. He doesn’t want to lose their vote, because ultimately Trump is about winning. I don’t think there’s a principled bone in his body.”",0
1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,"Would he be so tolerant of a president who pandered to racists if they were not friends? “Probably not,” he admits. “When I came back here from CNN, I could count on one hand the number of people who contacted me – and he did, repeatedly. For all his faults, Trump can be very loyal.”",0
1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,"I have always wondered what Trump smells like. Another snort of laughter. “Quite expensive aftershave and not overly done, just a light, gentle aroma. You imagine he’d smell like some flamboyant nightclub owner in the 70s, but he doesn’t.” And the hair product? “You get a whiff of hairspray, ’cause it is permanently coiffured. He’s actually a germaphobe. If you coughed, it was like you’d got the plague and out would come the Purell [hand sanitiser] and he wouldn’t shake hands with people. He was obsessive about it. Then, when he gets hit by a real killer virus, he treats it like a bloody casual load of nonsense. I don’t get that.”",0
1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,"Often it is hard to separate the personal from the political in Morgan’s spats. Take Prince Harry and Meghan, whom he has attacked relentlessly as hypocrites. Is it not also partly because Meghan, who had been a friend, ghosted him after she hooked up with Harry? “If Meghan Markle had done to you what she did to me, you would have been pissed off,” he says. “I literally put her in a cab from my pub after a two-hour chat. The moment she got in that cab, she went to a dinner party where Harry was; the next night they had a one-on-one at Soho House or wherever it was and I never hear from her again. Gone.” He sounds like a man spurned. “I just found her incredibly shallow and the social-climbing element quite appalling.”",0
1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,"But yes, he accepts – maybe he has been too hard on them at times. “My son Stanley said: ‘Dad, why do you care so much about Harry and Meghan?’ and I said: ‘I don’t really.’ And he said: ‘Well, it looks as if you do.’”",0
1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,"I wonder much the same thing as Stanley. How serious is Morgan about his woke hatred? Two years ago, he posted a screenshot of Daniel Craig carrying his baby in a papoose and tweeted: “Oh 007.. not you as well?!!! #papoose #emasculatedBond”. Papoosegate went global. “It ended up as two minutes on the NBC nightly news based on my tweet. How can that be right? That’s just an illiberal liberal explosion around the world completely out of kilter with the one observation I had, which is I don’t like papooses.” He manages to look outraged. Oh, come off it, I say: you must have been thrilled. He snorts with laughter. “If you’re a contrarian who likes to be at the centre of everyone’s thought processes, it was fantastic!”",0
1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,"And does he really give a flying fungal mycoprotein about vegan sausage rolls? “Do I sit here and genuinely feel a pathological hatred of papooses or vegan sausage rolls? No. Do I find it quite amusing to do a tweet or express an opinion on GMB about how I don’t like them, which is genuinely true? Yes. But I don’t want to stop people eating them or wearing them.”",0
1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,"Wake Up is a strange book. A third of the way through, Morgan seems to have forgotten about woke. The pandemic is raging – and so is he about the government’s handling of it. Whenever he gets the chance on GMB, he pulverises the clueless politicians for their incompetence, laziness and lies. (Soon enough, ministers boycotted the show.) Professionally, he has had a magnificent pandemic. For the first time in ages, he started punching up at worthy targets. “What the pandemic gave me was something to go at really, really hard, like the Iraq war. And I think I’ve been at my best journalistically when I’ve had something to get my teeth stuck into. When there’s nothing really going on and I’m creating a few firestorms because that’s my instinctive nature, that’s me at my worst – just a bit bored, sinking my fangs, which can be ferocious, into fairly inconsequential things, contributing to the general culture wars in a not-particularly-helpful manner.”",0
1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,"Was he in danger of becoming a shock-jock? “Yes. When there isn’t much going on, you can be in danger of just spouting off about stuff and it looks as if you’re just constantly furious.”",0
1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,"In recent months, Morgan has also been fired up by the killing of George Floyd, not least because Stanley is involved with the Black Lives Matter movement. As for his eight-year-old daughter, Elise, she has also helped him put things into perspective. “I said to her: ‘Trump is a completely unique character,’ and she said: ‘You know, Dada, you can be too unique.’”",0
1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,"He says he has also learned from the examples set by 100-year-old Capt Tom Moore, who raised more than £32m by walking around his garden 100 times, and the footballer Marcus Rashford, who succeeded in getting the government to change its policy on free school meals. “You couldn’t get two more different people from two more different backgrounds and yet they are united by one thing – the ability to effect enormous change through old-fashioned civility.”",0
1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,"I think you were bored when you started writing this book and were playing the pantomime villain, I say. “Well, I’ve never actually been bored,” he protests.

I do not believe Harry is capable of any of the above named criteria. Harry has never earned anything. Everything in his life was given freely to him.

I asked them what is the difference between a capsule and normal tablet? They said there is a wrapper (outer cover) in a capsule, but there is no wrapper in a tablet. I said correct. You know why capsules have a wrapper (outer cover), because they have the sensitive ingredients (data) inside the wrapper, should not get reacted by outer environment (like oxygen), so the wrapper (outer cover) works as a barrier to protect the sensitive ingredients from the outer environment.",0

1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,"Now I will explain it in programming terms: Encapsulation is a mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) or hiding the data (variables) [remember wrapping the sensitive ingredients in a capsule] and code acting on the data (methods) together as as single unit. In encapsulation the variables of a class will be hidden from other classes and can be accessed only through the methods of their current class, therefore it is also known as data hiding.

If it's not hidden then it must be a tablet and the manufacturer should not spend more money simply on the wrapper].",0

1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,When I first moved to Iceland my next door neighbour had all night parties every day of the week. The music was so loud that everything in my apartment shook. I had one of those apps on my phone that tells you what song is playing in the background and it pinged every few minutes from my bedside table because it could pick up so clearly what music he was playing.,0
1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,"After a week of this I knocked on his door and asked him to turn the music down. He was quite friendly, said sorry and told me proudly all about how he was a music producer and his speakers were just so powerful it was impossible to keep the volume low. I asked him to at least keep it down at night so I could sleep and he said he would try.",0
1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,"He didn’t try and it continued like this for another week. I knocked on his door again but this time he was really pissed at me. He told me “Do you realise this is the SECOND time you’ve complained this week?”. I told him, yes, I did realise and did he realise this was the 14th night in a row that he’d played his music so loud I couldn’t even hear my own TV at full volume?",0
1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,So he got really aggressive and flippant and told me “Well this is Iceland. I’m allowed to play my music. No one else has a problem with it so if you don’t like it go back to the country you came from. Or call the police - I don’t care!”. Then he slammed the door in my face and through the door I could hear him laughing with his friends about it.,0
1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,"I felt pretty down and frustrated about it and soon after I got really sick with flu, probably from the stress and lack of sleep.",0
1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,"So once a day I would take one of my used snotty tissues and wipe it all over his door handle. Sure enough, for about a week the parties stopped, I assume because he got flu and was too sick to throw them. Oh that little window of quiet was SUCH bliss!!!",0
1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,"But then one Wednesday morning I was woken at 5 AM with the sound of loud dance music and lots of girls whooping and screaming. I remembered his words “call the police if you don’t like it”, so I did. The cops showed up, and shut the party down.",0
1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,Later the next evening there was a knock at my door and it was him.,0
1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,"“Did you call the police on me last night” he asked, extremely put out.",0
1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,"I told him, yes I did.",0
1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,Indignantly he asked “Can you NOT call the police on me. Next time just come and speak to me!”,0
1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,I told him “But I did speak to you about it before and you were just rude.”,0
1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,"Not knowing what to say he just looked at me for a few moments then said in a pointless and bitter threat “just don’t call them again, ok?”",0
1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,"I replied “ok, if you don’t keep me awake all night then I won’t call them”.",0
1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,"It was kind of ok for a few weeks but then got noisy again. Finally, he couldn’t resist and threw another party. As it happens I had friends staying with me and they came into my bedroom at 2 AM and asked me to do something because they couldn’t sleep. So I called the cops who shut the party down.",0
1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,A few weeks later he was kicked out of his apartment. It turns out that he wasn’t a music producer but he was a drug dealer and the police arrested him that night and his landlord was informed.,0
1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,I found out later that every single person in the apartment block had been complaining about him for months. But I guess he’d never dared any of them to call the police. I felt like I did every one a massive favour by taking him on! And wow! It felt so good when he was finally gone!,0
1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,"I was battling a pretty tenacious flu and had pulled my aching, feverish, foggy self from bed to go to the doctor to get meds. It was an exceptionally awful weather day: freezing, harsh, battling rain that beat down, pelting from all sides. Traffic was a mess, cabs were hard to get, but I did get one and set off to the doctor.",0
1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,"On the way there my sister called to check in on how I was doing and to make sure I got to the doctor’s okay because I was really out of it. So I’m in the cab, on the phone and we arrive at my destination. Still pouring hail bullets outside. I see outside everywhere people are rushing in & out of the subway or trying to get cabs. Buses and cars are jammed everywhere because it’s New York and everybody becomes a moron in the rain and it’s an unholy, predictable mess.",0
1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,"Outside my cab I see a woman with a yellow umbrella motioning to my driver — she sees we are about to close out the ride and she wants my cab. Fair enough, normal NYC behaviour so far. I’m still on the phone with my sister and tally out the fare on the screen and put my card in the swipey thingy. I’m vaguely aware there’s close-by talking right outside my door. It’s the woman with the yellow umbrella, talking either to my driver to make sure he’s still working or to warn off others that THIS IS HER CAB.",0
1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,"It’s like that: you do sometimes have to stake your claim or get usurped by a wilier native cab whisperer. I know, I’m a very good cab whisperer.

1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,"Okay, so back to the fare … the machine is running Windows 98 or something because it hangs and spins and nothing happens to finalize payment.

1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,"We wait for it to reset and I try again. This time it’s taking. Still on the phone with my sister. I become aware that Yellow Umbrella Lady is right at my passenger door, ready to swoop in. Okay. I get that, she sees I’m getting out in a second. She is still screaming, though. Why is she screaming? What is this woman saying?",0
1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,She is screaming at me. She is yelling for me to Get. Out. Already.,0

1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,"But she does think I’m dawdling. She is looming over my window, peering in. I finalize payment, gather my bag and reach for the door handle, which is the cue she’s been waiting for.",0

1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,"Unfortunately, I believe Meghan has many narcissistic qualities. I say this as someone with first hand experience in narcissistic and spousal abuse.",0
1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,Common Warning Signs of Narcissistic Abuse include:,0
1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,"1. Using partners to further their career, social stantus, and personal monetary gain. Markle has a long history of using partners to further her career, boost her social status, and benefit financially. Before Markle met Prince Harry a business associate of hers said Markle “asked to meet FAMOUS men to date”. Meghan Markles best friend said Markle was obsessed with becoming famous, that she “used people” to get what she wanted and treated her first husband so terribly it ruined their 30 year friendship.
2. Replacing partners beliefs, political views, and opinions with their own. Before meeting Markle, Prince Harry never showed any interest in being politically active, in Climate Change, in Feminism, in Womens Rights, in Immigration Policy, in fighting Privilege/Inequality, in Race/Gender policy, or Animal Rights.
3. The abuser is very controlling and will slowly restrict their victims speech, their eating habits, their hobbies, their entire lifestyle, their friends, and their job to fit their own wants/needs. Prince Harry now only speaks the same opinions of his wife, many reporters who have known him for decades say he sounds nothing like himself, Meghans friends even reported she writes his speeches for him, Harry himself reported his wife changed his eating and drinking habits, Markle changed Harrys hobbies from hunting, polo, to her own, Markle has also banned and removed many of Harrys old friends from his friend group and replaced them with her own, and now has convinced Harry to give up his entire career, country, family and friends to fit her wants and needs.
4. The abuser will remove their victim from all former friends, co workers and family in order to control them more. This is self explanatory. In order to quit the Royal Family, neither Markle nor Harry had to leave England. Harry did not have to be separated from everyone he has ever known, all his friends and his entire family in order to step back from public life. According to reports from the Palace, Meghan forced Harry to choose between her and Archie or she would leave him. Harry himself said he “had no other choice” but to leave his country, his family, and friends, and I personally believe this report to be true-that in order to satisfy her own wants/needs Markle threatened to leave Harry with the child and made her husband sacrifice everything he had ever known to get what she wanted.
5. The abuser has a history of using and discarding family members, friends and spouses. Markle has a long list of discarded friends, co workers, and family members who have come fore ward to complain of how Markle used and discarded them. This includes her entire white family, her black family, the entire Royal Family, her spouse and spouses family, as well as her long time friends, sorority sisters, co workers from her childhood, and L.A. There are many reports from her classmates, co workers and staff that that she was abusive as well.
6. The abuser has a long history of lying, and gaslighting to confuse their victims. Markles history of lying is so long, it could be considered pathological lying.Here is a short list of just some of the lies, and gaslighting Markle has used: Quora User's answer to Is Meghan Markle more genuine than Kate Middleton? [ https://www.quora.com/Is-Meghan-Markle-more-genuine-than-Kate-Middleton/answers/209981391 ]
7. The abuser is extremely charming and charismatic and presents a “kind, compassionate” facade to the public, but is unkind, hard hearted and cruel in private. Markle uses a “kind, humanitarian” public facade, but her actions prove her to be cruel, and a times heartless. When her father was near death of 2 heart attacks, she diddnt even bother to call him and later abandoned him, refusing to let him see his own grandchild, even though she herself called him “the best father in the world.” Markles treatment of her first spouse could be considered spousal abandonment and emotional abuse in court ( she abandoned him with no warning or notice ), and when her own family members reported they were homeless and impoverished she refused to help them. Another family member is currantly in an abusive relationship with a man who has threatened to kill his spouse while putting a gun to her head previously, and another family member is reportedly “close to death” because of his drug addiction. These are all her family members, yet she would rather they live in homelessness, live in poverty, live in physically abusive relationships and die of overdose then offer any of them a helping hand. Let me repeat that. She would rather her own nephew die of an overdose then offer to help him. I understand disliking, or being distant, from family. But abandoning both sides of your family and preferring them to die than to help them is abusive.
8. Narcissistic abusers are not able to admit they are wrong, take accountability for their actions, or apologize. They always play victim, blame others, or use excuses. Never once has Markle apologized for her actions, admitted she was wrong, or taken accountability for the multiple times she has hurt people. She has never apologized to her family or friends for abandoning them, has never admitted she was wrong for her gross hypocrisy, or abusive behavior. Markle portrays herself as the Ultimate Victim-everything she has ever done wrong is blamed on the Press, the Royal Family, her Family, or because of her nationality, her gender, or her race. Any legitimate criticism is dismissed as people being “hateful”, any claims of abuse are “people being sexist/racist”, any evidence of her hypocrisy is “because of the Evil British Press”. And anyone who dare criticize her, or make her look bad, is “toxic”. This is a textbook gaslighting technique abusers and narcissists use. They claim their victims are horrible people who have treated them terribly, while in reality, it was them who abused the victim. And while the British Press has published some unfair articles about her, mostly they have treated her normally-this is not uncommon, and is the same treatment given every member of the Royal Family, all politicians and celebrities.

The wedding was about her, solely about her. I think her father, who wasn’t invited, and ridiculed openly, might have been on to soemthing. She is not the Grande Dame of the Royal Family, and never will be, seems like Meghan could learn a thing or two from Elizabeth.

2. Only a trained medical professional can diagnose someone.
3. You can’t diagnose someone who haven’t met.

If you are doing that you are assuming and not diagnosing. You cannot look a few videos, read a few lies claiming to be true, and assume you know enough about someone to make a diagnosis.That’s not how it works.
4. Reading Webmd and wikipedia page on narcissitic personality disorder does not make you an expert.

1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,Humans need to have a sense of belonging to feel safe This is influenced by our belief around how acceptable we are.,0
1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,"The belief around acceptability is influenced positively or negatively in babyhood. Dysharmony between family members negatively influences the young child to believe he/she is unacceptable as the child blames self due to egocentricity which is limited capacity to see others perspectives so child believes they are responsible for the disharmony. Child sees self as bad and unacceptable feels very unsafe but needs to be accepted to feel safe. Child learns to overcompensate to get acceptance by creating a nice version and manipulating others. They may become perfectionist or public figures only showing aacceptable version of themselves. They are often vigilant to avoid looking bad as “bad” (which they aren’t it’s a belief) means rejected. They are often controlling (to avoid negative outcomes which could make them look bad and even more rejectable). They keep moving in a perpetual search to get to safety. They never feel safe and are terrified of abandonment because they believe people will see who they really are, they will be discovered as a bad person, and ultimately rejected. As they believe they are “unacceptable and their partners will eventually leave” they have multiple partners in reserve. They will have a stable of partners. They achieve this by learning early who can be manipulated easily - people pleasers and how to - love bomb followed by threats. They learn what people pleasers want - love and often the people pleasers are narcissistic too they may like beauty and status but more subtly. The narcissist becomes adept at targeting others who have a need to be loved and a need for validation. The narcissist can be very beautiful, appear vulnerable, wealthy, charitable, they love bomb, whatever works to attract a target. Once the target is acquired the narcissist charms manipulates, sets the trap and isolates and this all happens with speed to stop their targets from leaving. As they never feel safe they are like a butterfly flying from one flower to the next. They drain each partner and leave behind them a trail of burn out, confusion and destruction.",0

You don’t insist that your husband pulls out of a solemn memorial service for a Corps of which he is Honorary Captain General because you want to go to a film premiere and have him beg for a job for you. You don;’t pretend to problerms by using other people’s article as yours. You don’t use a royal title to promote a commercial busoness. You don’t treat a programme about the poorest area in the world as a chance to claim that you, living in the height of luxury with servants wall to wall, is not thriving, barely surviving. You don;t, after you husband’s country has invested 53 millions and waited pateiently till you can be bothered to do any of the work, then run off with the gormless puppet himself to make money and fame for yourself abroad/. Above on, you don’t arrange with a hasbeen “interviewer” to deliver a carefully scripted diatribe, full of lies, twisted half truths and nasty innuendoes - that is, unless you are illmannered. badly brought up and downright malignant.",0
1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,"Without testing it can’t be certain, but even psychologists look at patterns of behavior to help with a diagnosis. So based on her behavior alone I’d say yes to narcissistic personality disorder (NPD).",0
1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,Her body language as a start - she literally hangs on Harry and controls his movements.,0
1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,She is hypersensitive to criticism. No one likes to be criticized but she is an exaggerated version of what happens when ones ego is fragile.,0
1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,"She is passive aggressive toward his elderly grandmother for crying out loud. I mean…snide remarks, rebellious actions, etc. It’s a well established that narcissists begin the splintering and isolation of their partners from family at some point. Draw them in with honey and then little stings begin to happen…gradually. To go after his grandma though….shines a light on her character (or lack thereof). Her treatment of the elders in her life period says a lot. A lack of empathy and dignity for others crosses into antisocial PD as well. It appears as though once someone has served their purpose she no longer feels a loyalty to them. This lack of attachment is yet another sign. His grandmother is a strong woman, so saying no even once to her would have hurt her fragile ego. And the all out attack via the small passive aggressive electronic stings from her desk is a definite sign of a narcissist. She has pretty much said she can do what she wants because her baby is forever royal too…which is yet another low passive aggressive blow. There are too many signs in here to mention them all (straight from her).",0
1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,"She has shown her manipulative personality several times, but the one that struck me was when she was plying for public sympathy by playing the new mom card (I’m a victim of people saying mean things). This was after her dad called her out as well. If you get too close to the real self these folks push back and break (fragile ego). A characteristic of them is controlling what you think of them, and what you think period ideally. They can not handle anything contrary to their own inflated sense of self. This is also why they control and isolate their partners. While new mothers are more fragile and tender, the interview seemed inauthentic - her holding back tears seemed like acting, and rehearsed. I felt it strongly, and I did not like nor dislike her when I saw that interview. I know authentic and this was far from it (in my opinion).",0
1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,"She has successfully separated him from his family, friends, and support systems (all he knows), and is trying to reinvent his world, while also putting wedges here and there for public display. She continues to draw attention (negative or positive), via Instagram evidently, even though what’s best for him is no attention for awhile. She has no humility, and that is due to her fragile ego and sense of self importance.",0
1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,Several of her own family members have warned others. Not just one. That can not just be dismissed as coincidence. It wouldn’t be dismissed by a clinician.,0

1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,"Proactive manipulation - she has been outspoken about this one…said she wants to control what people see and hear about her. Remember one of the criteria is controlling what others think about you. Deleting Instagram comments that are contrary is also another sign of being hypersensitive to criticism, while manipulating to assure an inflated sense of self is upheld. The defense mechanisms again, are cruel and unnecessary. She can’t help it though.",0
1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,"By her own words and actions she needs to be at the center. When Harry has needed to do family first she looks like she wants to cry. Fragile ego yet again. That’s why they left ultimately - she felt hurt that protocol meant she could not hang on him, or had to step behind another, and she was not allowed to have knee jerk reactions to perceived slights by the press. Cruel or not - a person with a strong sense of self will have self control and listen to advisers. When he said no to holding hands, for example, she lost control which would make her feel fearful…because narcs need control always. They can be very good at hiding that, but she isn’t. Covert versus overt.",0

These people can be extremely seductive, and it’s hurtful to see anyone, anywhere get tangled in these webs. To see it publicly playing out is hard…thus why I spoke up here. For what it’s worth.",0
1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,"And by the way - I feel sorry for people who have NPD. However, the disorder is nearly impossible to treat so it’s best to get away unless you know how to manage it. If she has dirt on him (we all have secrets) she will try to hurt him if/when it ends. Her only way to control then, will be to control what others think about him (it’s always about control). 
His family will be there unconditionally I feel though. I hope the public will too.",0

1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,Why? There are a number of traits she demonstrates in her actions and the way she carries herself. I am not a professional but I did spend lots of time with someone who was narcissistic and I see many of the same traits.,0
1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,"A few examples. She is very well scripted and rehearsed. When asked in the interview with Oprah if she was prepared for the role of princess and she replied “no, I did not research anything”. Yet her very well rehearsed and scripted answers for the interview would show otherwise. She wanted to try very hard to represent herself in an extra good light in the interview. In doing so, she spent time researching and preparing how to conduct herself and also how to portray herself as as the victim. So how could she not have investigated and researched what it could be like to be a princess? The fact that she answered no suggesting she did not research or know what was in store for her shows she has narcissistic traits. Traits of someone trying to portray themselves in the best light. The normal person would have replied why yes.. of course I researched it. I would want to know what my future would look like.",0
1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,"I want to add just one thing here before I go any further in regards to the Oprah interview and being a royal. There is, no doubt that being in the Royal family would be a tormented hellish life. So I think that much that she spoke of in the interview was likely true. But anyone, and I mean anyone who was going to join into this family would have researched how difficult it would be and try and get some preparation for the role.",0
1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,"She seems disconnected when asked about Archie or Harry. When she responds she seems to be using her training from her acting career to respond and show emotion. Everyone even a full blown Narcissist (with the right know how) can learn how to react appropriately. They can seem believable but if you really know what to look for, you can see through it. Narcissists are all about themselves but they can turn on the charm if they need to or if they want something they are master manipulators. But again, someone who knows what to look for can see right through it.",0
1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,I have a sneaking suspicion that after Oprah completed that interview she called up her good friend Gail and entrusted her to share what she felt about Meghan. And I assure you it must not have been good.,0
1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,"There are other personality disorders that mimic narcissistic traits such as borderline personality disorder. But I think she leans towards a self serving narcissist. Harry is so easy to read. Anyone watching him speak can see that is is a truly good soul - with a kind heart and a gentle spirit. When someone like that is in love, they can be blinded often by self serving manipulative narcissists.",0

1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,"Personally I think people who HATE the Duchess of Sussex have gone overboard, but at this point, I think it is impossible to look at Meghans behavior and NOT conclude that she is not a very likeable person.",0
1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,"To explain why Meghan Markle is seen as having narcissistic traits, and an unkind woman would take an entire book to explain, but I will try to sum up why she is so unpopular as shortly as possible.",0
1452708846367961088,Piers Morgan is a miserable git,"1. Meghan uses then dumps people: Meghan used her first husband for Hollywood connections then abandoned him when he was no longer useful, she abandoned her best friend of 30 years when she pointed out Meghan was cruel to her husband, she abandoned her currant best friend Jessica who she used to social climb into Canadas top social circle when she was let go from her job, she abandoned her entire white family, she abandoned her entire black family minus her mother, she abandoned her L.A friends, she abandoned her dog Bogart when it became “too old”, she abandoned her nephew that was reportedly close to dying, she abandoned her family members that were homeless instead of helping them ( shocking, I know ), she abandoned her friends she made in Britain, she abandoned the Royal Family then bullied them in front of the entire world, including the Queen of England herself. At this point, most everybody sees that this pattern cannot just be a coincidence.
2. Meghan is unkind: Meghan abandoned her loving husband by sending him the ring in the mail which courts could consider spousal abuse, Meghan reportedly abandoned her dog because it was “too old” for her, Meghans former Sorority Sister said she was “a bully in school”, Meghan abandoned her own father when he had 2 heart attacks and nearly died and emotionally abuses him by promising to never let him see his grandchild ever again which is shocking considering all her Dad did was make ONE PR mistake, Meghan left her own family members to homelessness despite being a millionaire ( seriously, look it up ), Meghan also refused to reach out and help her own nephew whose friends reported to him being close/at risk to dying and many of Meghans old staff have come fore ward to accuse her of being abusive to staff. Meghan has also come fore ward saying all kinds of horrible, mean things about the Royal Family, Prince William and Kate despite their being very nice people. I understand that sometimes people come across as unkind but are really misunderstood. But after so many accounts of Meghan being an unkind person, I just think at this point it is impossible to conclude that it is true.
3. Meghan loves fame/money: Meghans own best friend of 30 years said Meghan was “desperate to be famous” and “always dreamed of being a celebrity”. Meghan herself said she wanted to be a “household name”, that she “wanted to break the internet”. Her own family who knew her best called her a “diva”, a “narcissist” and “shallow”. Before Meghan married Harry, she was already a multi millionaire, but never donated any of her money to charity, she only ever showed up to charity events to smile for the cameras. And then when she got her title, she continued not to donate anything, yet spent $1 million on clothes in a year, $2–4 million of taxpayers money on her mansion, $500,000 on ONE celebrity filled party, spent 10x more time hanging out with A list celebs like the Clooneys, Beckhams, Clintons, Obamas, Adele, Ed Sheeran, Beyonce, J Lo, than she ever did with the poor, and flew around on private jets while screeching about Climate Change.
Sometimes, truth is stranger than fiction and the story of Meghan Markle sounds like something strait out of a horrible movie where Kim Kardashian marries into the Royal Family. It sounds insane, but its all true.",0

I cannot imagine that as of the wedding day to now, the Duchess has not spoken to her father. I am sure they did speak after those ‘photos’ of him clothes shopping. I am sure she told him the effects of playing the media and talked about the importance of not getting involved with the press. In fact, I am sure the Duchess spoke to her father long before their engagement and talked candidly about the pro’s and con’s of being part of the Royal family.

But the reality is that their are some 'families' that you marry into, where their social importance is very much based on the image they portray. The British royal family is one of those such families. They are popular because of the sense of pride they instill in the majority of the British population; they are the visual figureheads of our country. We expect them to rise above the nonsense of social media, above the tittle-tattle of the gutterpress. When Meghan married into this family, she knew this and knew that if her half-siblings went to the press (which was always highly likely), she would have to follow the Royal family's policy of simply not responding. I suspect she was shocked when it was her father who got involved with trying to play the media…and she no doubt was incredibly hurt and disappointed when he continued down that line. I don't doubt for a moment she didn't beg him not to communicate with the press further and explained that if he did, she would be put in a position when her duty to the Royal family would mean she would have to stop communicating with him.

Many bi-racial kids are never accepted among their own family members and that is what we are seeing here. The abuse was behind closed doors and she got sick of it and she wrote about it in her old Instagram page. While private 2 years ago it is now out in the open for the world to see. It is also interesting that he is giving so much “sympathy” when they are the ones who started this one-sided drama yet the Duchess has NEVER said anything. All they do is insulting her and people around her and people have gall to say “Meghan call your Dad!”.

1452662300465238019,jennifer lopez is horrible man,"The Most Painful Criticism That Has Stuck With Jennifer Lopez For Years Jennifer Lopez is revered as a woman who seems like she can do it all. She is a singer, an actress, a dancer, a businesswoman, a producer, a reality TV star, an author, and so much more. She is an extremely successful multi-hyphenate with legions of adoring fans. As much as (most) people love her, J.Lo does receive some criticism, just like any other human being on the planet. She has developed a thick skin throughout her decades in the entertainment industry, but even Jenny from the Block faces self-doubt from time to time. In 2015, Lopez appeared on the talk show Good Morning Britain, where she confessed, ""I'm very insecure about my voice,"" per Mirror. Despite her success and many accolades as a musical artist, Lopez just can't shake some of the criticism she has encountered. The mother two explained, ""After being told for so many years that you're not as good as this person or that person, it beats away on your insecurities."" ""I always wanted to be a singer and a dancer but when they start dissecting you like that, it does work away at your insecurities,"" Lopez added. At times, the Bronx native thought to herself, ""Wow, I thought I was good at this,"" acknowledging that ""it does get to you. I'm only human."" Except that she's Jennifer Lopez, a superhuman, by most people's standards, anyway. Many people are hard on themselves, and there's nothing wrong with a desire to improve, but Lopez's success is undeniable.",0
1452662300465238019,jennifer lopez is horrible man,"Reflecting on her career, Jennifer Lopez said in a panel discussion, ""It was different people in my life at different times that were like 'You are good at this"" (via Hola). Lopez recalled, ""I'd go into studios and I'd be like 'Well I'm not a great singer,' and they're like 'What are you talking about?'"" When she countered with ""Well I don't sing like Aretha Franklin,"" she was told ""It doesn't matter. You sing like Jennifer Lopez and people love it."" A lot of people. Lopez described those conversations as ""moments [that] you remember,"" explaining ""people, they just plant a seed for you to look at yourself in a better way. And it's those moments that just — you keep going."" In November 2018, People reported that she mused, ""You know, I've really become — and I think from being in this business, I don't let the opinion of others really influence how I think about myself."" Even so, Lopez did not develop that positive outlook overnight, admitting that it ""took a long time,"" and she felt ""really bad about"" herself early in her career. When her first movie Selena and debut album On the 6 became hits, Lopez told herself ""I'm killing it,"" but she did have some haters who bluntly claimed, ""She can't sing, she can't dance, she can't act, she's just some pretty face or her butt is big.""

She told herself, ""I'm a great actress, I'm a great singer, a great dancer, I'm great at this stuff! And I'm gonna keep going!"" In addition to never giving up, Lopez said she ""started working harder and harder than everybody else."" She recounted, ""I started believing in myself. I started believing in the fact that I wasn't an imposter, that I wasn't a fake."" The Maid in Manhattan actress shared, ""the most important thing for me is not listening to all the outside voices."" She made it a priority to speak to herself with a ""voice"" that is ""lifting [her] up."" Lopez reflected on her star-making role in Selena during an interview with Billboard, revealing that the film's concert scenes inspired her to pursue her own music career. She divulged, ""I sang in musicals before but as part of a cast, never as a solo artist upfront or a recording artist. It made me realize, 'Don't neglect parts of yourself and let people put you in a box because you're an actress.'

Plus, we still care about her. (Hello, you’ve read at least this much of an examination of her career.)",0
1452662300465238019,jennifer lopez is horrible man,"But isn’t there something a little depressing about the fact that her music career has reached this nadir? Sure, Jennifer Lopez was never a groundbreaking artist, but she was a good one. “If You Had My Love” was silky-smooth with just the right amount of anguished yearning. “Let’s Get Loud” proved just how alive Lopez becomes when performing in a Latin element. (See her recent tribute to Celia Cruz for more on that. Or just go watch Selena.) And millennials just need to look at a photo of her next to Ja Rule to feel sad about what’s been lost.",0
1452662300465238019,jennifer lopez is horrible man,"A.K.A. is, at best, a hodgepodge of rip-offs of other musicians’ styles and, at worst, just horribly bland. It kicks off with the one-two punch of “A.K.A.,” which sounds like a track M.I.A. would’ve rejected for good reason, and “First Love,” which, sure, has a sort-of “Crazy In Love” beat driving it, to continue the Beyoncé comparisons, but lacks any sort of life in the vocals.",0
1452662300465238019,jennifer lopez is horrible man,"To that regard, there’s some irony in the fact that, midway through the album on a track called “Emotions,” Lopez wails in auto-tuned anguish, “Someone took my emotions…” The biggest problem with A.K.A. is just that. For all the cacophonous arrangements and genre schizophrenia the album assaults us with, there’s a startling lack of humanity or, yep!, emotions. (I heard they’ve been stolen. I also heard that they are kind-of crucial elements in music.)",0
1452662300465238019,jennifer lopez is horrible man,"It’s actually the softer songs that stand out. “Never Satisfied” is a legitimately moving ballad, and the rare song on A.K.A. to allow Lopez to be unbridled, singing with a pleasurable lack of vocal restraint. Listen closely enough, and you can hear a bit of emotional catharsis.",0
1452662300465238019,jennifer lopez is horrible man,"And I think I actually heard a crack in her voice in “Let It Be Me.” Not because she was hitting a bum note, either—because she was feeling something. Backed with only a spare string arrangement, she sang with imperfections and it is the closest thing she has to a perfect song on the album—despite her apparently aggressively effort to polish each of the other tracks until they sparkle with generic perfection.",0
1452662300465238019,jennifer lopez is horrible man,"Take, for example, the closing triplet of “Troubeaux,” “Expertease,” and “Same Girl,” three songs that are best categorized as easy listening meets urban pop.

It can now.",0

And “Tens,” with its opening call to “clap, bitches, clap / snap, bitches, snap,” seems to attempt dance-floor camp but misses the mark entirely, landing a bull’s-eye on failed parody instead. Other songs, like “So Good,” are downright grating.",0
1452662300465238019,jennifer lopez is horrible man,"On the other hand, “Booty” is an example of Lopez venturing into the campier arenas of pop music and succeeding. “She got the boom to shake the room,” she sings on a track that belongs on the current charts alongside deplorable pop genius like Jason Derulo’s “Wiggle” and Pitbull’s “Timber.” The staccato beat guides you to the dance floor, the Ibiza-ready swells to keep you grooving when you get there, and the silly-sexy lyrics that are perfect to belt along with like the fools we are.",0

Not only has she showed off her acting skills in movies such as Selena, Maid In Manhattan, and Hustlers, she's also appeared on the small screen as a judge on American Idol and World of Dance, and as an actor in the NBC police drama Shades of Blue, where she also worked behind the camera. She's also one of the biggest names in the music world with several hits under her belt, including classics such as ""On The Floor,"" ""Jenny From The Block,"" and ""Let's Get Loud.""

The former couple wed in 2004 and welcomed their fraternal twins, Max and Emme, in 2008 but confirmed they were going their separate ways in July 2011. Anthony was the one to file for divorce in April 2012. In her 2013 documentary, Dance Again, J.Lo got extremely candid about how much she struggled after they went their separate ways, even breaking down in tears while speaking about her former husband. ""Work is a blessing and a curse. I remember being on the set and being in my dressing room and not feeling like I could get up in the morning,"" she recalled (via Cheat Sheet). ""It was very hard to get up in the morning. Very hard. When you're depressed and sad all the time, it's very difficult."" Lopez confessed that it felt as though her ""whole life had fallen apart"" when they split, adding, ""What I had known for seven or eight years with my children and everything, it was just boom. An explosion."" Though the divorce was her third, the star never imagined her romance with the ""I Need to Know"" singer not working out — and it was made all the harder because they share children. ""My dream was for us to always be together,"" she tearfully admitted. ""You never want to break up a family.""",0
1452662300465238019,jennifer lopez is horrible man,"Jennifer Lopez had to break down barriers as a Lantinx woman Jennifer Lopez is one of the most famous Latinx stars in the world, but she admitted there was a time she didn't know if she'd ever be cast in a role that wasn't a stereotype. Speaking to Zane Lowe on At Home With Apple Music, she said she used to wonder what her acting career would look like because she didn't want to be typecast as ""the Latin woman in the Latin role where you think I should play — the cook or the nanny or something like that."" She said she wanted to represent ""everybody and make everybody see that it didn't matter if you were Latin or black or Asian or whatever... you're a human being."" In 2019, J-Lo told Variety she was pigeonholed early in her career. ""Maybe 30 years ago, it was very 'Oh, you're the Latin girl. You'll do Spanish roles; you'll play maids; you'll only be limited to this little box,'"" she recalled to the outlet. (Lopez, of course, famously played a maid with big dreams in 2004's Maid In Manhattan). But she credited her strong team and her work ethic for breaking down those barriers, allowing her to take on more varied characters. Her role in 1997's Selena — about late singer Selena Quintanilla-Pérez — led to her breakthrough, as she said the movie ""made the impact that it needed to make"" in helping her to be seen as more than a stereotype while also inspiring people, particularly in the Latinx community.",0
1452662300465238019,jennifer lopez is horrible man,"It's hard to believe now, but before Jennifer Lopez was the proud owner of multiple homes across the country (including a $40 million estate in Miami, Florida, which she owns with ex-fiancé Alex Rodriguez, according to TMZ, and a $24 million penthouse in New York City, per Hello!) she was actually homeless. Lopez found herself out of her family home following a disagreement with her mother, Guadalupe Rodríguez, about her pursuing a dance career instead of furthering her education. Showing how serious she was about becoming a dancer despite her mom's opposition, J.Lo started spending her nights at the dance studio she practiced at. ""My mom and I butted heads. I didn't want to go to college — I wanted to try dance full-time. So she and I had a break. I started sleeping on the sofa in the dance studio. I was homeless, but I told her, 'This is what I have to do,'"" she recalled in a 2013 W interview. Fortunately, it wasn't long until her dance career really took off, and that became the jumping off point for the incredible career she's carved out for herself. Lopez got a dancing gig in Europe a few months after the fallout with her mom and then landed her dream job as a Fly Girl on the TV show In Living Color, which caused her to make the big move to Los Angeles.

Speaking to Entertainment Tonight, she recalled her bare minimum diet before landing her role on In Living Color, admitting she survived on pizza for ""a couple of years."" She shared a little more about that difficult period in a 2014 interview with The Sydney Morning Herald after she was asked what she would do if she only had $100 in the bank. ""I've been there,"" she admitted, ""when I only had $100, or $20, and had to eat a pizza every day for dinner, which cost $1.50 back at that time when I was a dancer, struggling as an artist."" But while those times were certainly tough, it sounds like the ""On The Floor"" singer wouldn't change them, as they're part of what made her the global superstar she is today. ""Those are the years that shape you, right?"" J.Lo admitted. ""When you are struggling, you're trying to make it, you learn resilience, you learn discipline, you learn to not give up, to have faith.""

She spoke out about how tough she found the unprecedented time in history and the effect it had on her usually very busy life. ""During this pandemic, I think there was a moment where the whole world was depressed, afraid, very afraid of what was going to happen,"" she said on the Spanish language radio station El Zol 107.9 in November 2020 (translated by Today), admitting it took a toll on her mental health. ""I had a lot of moments that I felt really bad, and also my kids — everyone, the whole house, my family, my girlfriends.""

""Emme came to my bed and she was crying, 'Why is this happening? I miss my friends.

""In the early part of my career... it made me feel really bad about myself,"" she confessed in 2018 (via Marie Claire) while recalling some of the hateful comments she received. ""My first song went to no. 1, my first album went to no. 1, and my first movie went to no. 1, and I was like 'yeah, I'm killin' it.' And then everyone was like 'she can't sing, she can't dance, she can't act — she's just a pretty face' or 'her butt is big,' or whatever they were saying about me,"" she said, admitting she even started to believe the nasty comments herself. ""It really hurt me for a long time,"" she shared. Lopez's former fiancé Ben Affleck also spoke out about the hate he saw her receive during their relationship, as they dated between 2002 and 2003. On a 2021 episode of The Hollywood Reporter's Awards Chatter podcast, he said ""people were so f**king mean about [Lopez]"" and accused the tabloids in particular of writing ""sexist"" and ""racist"" things about his Gigli co-star.

Lopez suggested she didn't know her worth at the time, admitting, ""Every day that you don't walk out that door, every day you accept things in your partner and in yourself, is a day that you're saying, 'It's OK.'"" The star has since worked hard to keep her mind as healthy as her body and uses therapy to help herself get stronger. Lopez has been going to therapy since at least her early 30s and shared that it helped her to learn how to love herself properly. ""I was doing all these things in like my personal relationships that didn't seem like I was loving myself, but I didn't even understand the concept of it.

Lopez shared her admiration for her long marriage to her uncle, who Rose was laid to rest next to. She wrote that the late couple's three children were her closest cousins growing up and told fans that they had such a close bond that she considered them to be sisters. ""I have so many emotions as I write this.

Lopez said there were no telltale signs that it was coming and shared the terrifying details of how, initially, she had no idea what was happening to her and had to sit and do nothing in her trailer to calm down. ""It's funny what tricks your mind plays on you. I just didn't want people to think I was falling apart. But when I look back on it now it's so odd to me that those are the words I chose to say: 'I am not weak.'"" She recalled how her bodyguard had to put her in the car and she went straight to the doctor, who diagnosed her as being ""'sleep deprived'"" and ""'overworked.'""

For a 2013 interview with W, she went home for the first time since her parents called her and her siblings (J.Lo has two sisters, Lynda Lopez and Leslie Lopez) back to tell them about their divorce. ""I think that's why I was nervous about coming here today. It's like seeing someone from the past — you're afraid to run into them because you never know if it's going to be 'wow' or very difficult.

1452662300465238019,jennifer lopez is horrible man,"Well, I believe she is. I read even opinions on Quora and they are pretty scary. This woman is quite an evil. I have not met her, but Serena Rossi, the Godmother of The Venice Film Festival made the HUGE mistake to introduce herself to Jennifer. Serena is not an A list celebrity in the world, and when she introduced herself Jennifer gave her a very bad look. This is disgusting. I find her behaviour classist and unacceptable. Serena is not Angelina Jolie but she’s a very capable artist. Maybe Jennifer is menthal… who knows.",0
1452662300465238019,jennifer lopez is horrible man,My opinion is that she has been mistreated most of her life as a latina. In America there is a huge gap between white and black people and she may have fought insanely to be accepted.,0
1452662300465238019,jennifer lopez is horrible man,"P.S. actually JLo is not a typical latina in her soul. Latinas are warm, generous, smart and they are really well spoken. J. LO may be smart and well spoken but forget about the other words.",0
1452662300465238019,jennifer lopez is horrible man,"All celebrities at the top are ‘mean’ on some level or are managed by ‘mean’ managers if they don’t want to the dirty work themselves. If someone has been so successful in the competitive world of showbusiness, they are definitely not pushovers or mild people. It takes a lot of strength to make it in the harsh world of music business in the US",0
1452662300465238019,jennifer lopez is horrible man,"She's a diva, her niceness is so fake it's disgusting. I used to work in a concert arena and it was known that shes a high maintenance me-me my poop doesnt stink jerk. Everything in her room had to be white, she made them close and sanitize the entire child playroom for only her kid or kids whatever she has. That isnt so bad, if you got the money to do that then do it. What was bad was that a doorman looked at her and apparently she hates when staff look at her. So she started yelling at her whoever about it, in front of the doorman like he wasn't there. He said, so much for Jenny from the block, well she got him fired. So it was known that when she came around,you dont look at her, because God forbid your plebian eyes gaze upon her. To her fans, obviously she's going to act different. To those who worked her venue, it was well known that she was an a hole.",0
1452662300465238019,jennifer lopez is horrible man,"I didn't look at what other people have said but I know two people that had interactions with her. One in a professional level and the other in a casual. First, was a friend of my wife who worked at the casino as a dealer and Jennifer and her mother had come in and jennifer treated her as a mechanical shuffle machine. The mother was trying to be nice at the end,her mother, started to give my wife's friend 25 dollar tip and jennifer was like * Mom no!” The woman thought maybe Jennifer was going to tip herself. But they got up and walked away.",0
1452662300465238019,jennifer lopez is horrible man,"The second person worked as as a grip at studios in Queens NY and he was on set for a shoot with jennifer lopez. They were told not to look at her. No one was allowed to speak to her and she spoke to no one. My friend showed me her picture ( that he took from his phone with her from behind and slightly to the side as she looked over city lights, which wasn't allowed but the only ones that cared about what she thought was her and maybe one other person that was with her) So these are absolutely true events. I had to laugh cause her commercial came on of her selling some vitamin supplement and I said to my wife…look it's Jenny from the block. ( You know her old promotional advertising logo to tell us she is down to earth) I said to my wife could you imagine being on the set of that commercial with her? After no one could look at her and being an ass she just starts this monolog like she is just “ Jenny from the block”. Lol",0
1452662300465238019,jennifer lopez is horrible man,And she lies with a smile. Face lift. Lots of surgery’s to fine tune her face. She had a boxy nose. Now slim and rounded. Her jaw line and wrinkles started going south in her 40s. She picked it up before it got to a point of being overly obvious. She’s love bombing the audience but acts like the devil in a dress behind closed doors. Typical grandiose narcissist.,0

He tells me she is the most down to earth big-hearted beautiful souls you will ever meet period She doesn't act like a huge star she is not rude when people ask for an autograph or photos. She is honest and will tell you if she doesn't have time to take one or sign.. but she doesn't do it in a negative or stuck up movie star way. My friend tells me she is goofy , funny and loves to make everyone she meets feel like they are important. She's definitely someone I would love to work with some day and have the chance to meet.",0
1452662300465238019,jennifer lopez is horrible man,"She is definitely not the “Jenny from the block” image that she wants everyone to believe she is. Her movie The Wedding Planner was filmed in San Francisco and scenes were shot inside city hall. In San Francisco, Deputies from the SF Sheriffs Department are responsible for the security of the building. I spoke to a couple of them afterwards and they didn’t have anything good to say about her other than the fact that she’s a diva.",0
