Her big ass head prolly sweating under that ugly ass wig #standojacat","If you say most then I think ‘YES’. The venom that suffuses rap had little place in black popular culture. Indeed, in black attitudes, before the 1960′s. The hip-hop ethos can trace its genealogy to the emergence in that decade of a black ideology that equated black strength and authentic black identity with a militantly adversarial stance toward American society. In the angry new mood, began to view black crime and violence as perfectly natural, even appropriate, responses to the supposed dehumanization and poverty inflicted by a racist society today.",0

But the victory of rap was doused by the crack epidemic.

Some like R&B, some like classical, and some like a freind of mine like death metal. My parents don't like rap. Mom like Disco, and Pop. My dad like Motown. I like rap, but the rap I grew up to. Rap from the 80's, 90's and faded away from 2000’s. Rap is not the only thing I listen to. So if I'm in a car listening to the radio more than likely I'm on a station that also plays ole school rap.

Now yeah occasionally, I do also listen to Hip Hop and Rap. Do I like it? Not really because it’s just too derogatory and too oppressing. But to generalize the African American community, yes most black people do like rap because it’s manufactured by mainly black people and explores issues we as black people can relate to, but every black person is different. It’s like asking if most white people like country music. Like duh. Some of us love System Of A Down and some of us have never even heard of it. But yeah our majority likes rap music.",0

Here in Australia, there is a statement on the lease agreements that I've signed - the tenant is expected to be able to have quiet enjoyment of the property and is obligated to allow the neighbours quiet enjoyment of their property as well. This means that it is reasonable for me to expect that there will be a peaceful neighbourhood and that I will not disturb the peace of the neighbourhood either.

For one thing, 52% of Canadians surveyed still approve of the Trudeau government’s performance. While that’s down from more than 70% at the beginning of the COVID-19 lockdown, Ipsos CEO Darrell Bricker said, “These are historically still very strong approval ratings, particularly for a second-term prime minister in a minority situation.”",0

This as we head towards the next election, which could happen at any time given Trudeau’s minority government and the fact the opposition parties control the majority of seats in Parliament. But the message to the new Conservative leader is that he or she needs to strike a balance between holding the Trudeau Liberals to account for the WE scandal and developing an election platform that will attract Canadians to vote for them, rather than simply against the Liberals.

• Diane Francis: Maxime Bernier and his anti-vax super-spreader party don't deserve your vote So Trudeau gets a failing grade in terms of economic management, but consider some of the other scandals and bungles his government has been involved in:
• Months of delays in getting vaccines because Trudeau signed a secret deal with China to make vaccines that the Chinese reneged on.
• Ethical violations involving the WE Charity scandal, another involving the abrogation of the rule of law to mitigate charges against SNC-Lavalin for years of corrupt practices and another one after Trudeau took a luxury holiday freebie from the Aga Khan, whose organization ended up getting millions in grants from Ottawa.
• The recent $5.2-billion bailout of the Muskrat Falls hydroelectric project in Newfoundland — which should never have been built and will never make money if finished.
• Millions spent travelling and giving away foreign aid in pursuit of a useless, temporary seat on the UN Security Council.
• Pledging $2.65 billion at a Commonwealth Leaders Summit to fight climate change even though Canada’s massive wetlands, farmland and vast forests act as a carbon sink.
• Pledging $840 million to Syria for humanitarian assistance when so many Indigenous reserves in Canada don’t have clean drinking water.
• Imposing draconian regulations and taxes on oil from Alberta, Saskatchewan and Newfoundland, but not on oil from Saudi Arabia.
• Imposing tough environmental assessments on new infrastructure projects, except in the case of a cement plant in Quebec.
• Attempting to hand an unneeded sole-source contract to WE Charity for nearly $1 billion after Trudeau’s mother and brother received around $300,000 from it for speaking gigs.
• Proroguing Parliament and frustrating any attempts to investigate Liberal mismanagement.

Since becoming Canada’s prime minister in 2015, he has raised taxes on the rich, legalized marijuana, put a rising price on carbon, renegotiated NAFTA, centered women’s rights in the country’s foreign policy, reduced child poverty to its lowest level in decades, and resettled tens of thousands of refugees.

A good example would be the issue of “ranked ballot” to replace “first-past-the-post”. This was a campaign promise that he caved to the opposition pressure (NDP, Greens demanding proportional representation as the only solution, and Conservatives demanding that “first-past-the-post” be retained) that “ranked ballot’’ was unfair and favoured the Liberal Party (of course, the opposition parties prefered choices all favoured their parties…). If it was Pierre Trudeau, he would have countered with the fact that “ranked voting” does favour the electorate’s second choice, and if your party has no chance of being the second choice of the electorate, there may be something wrong with your party’s ideology and platform. He would then tell the opposition to “fuddle-duddle” themselves and use his majority to pass the legislation on “ranked ballot”.",0

Most of the work is done in committee meetings, most of the work done in the House of Commons is as dull as watching paint dry, and only during Question Period is there great excitement (and perhaps some “good television”). Justin Trudeau appears to do this part of the job well, and/or has delegated strong people to do these tasks. He has made some bad decisions — can anyone name a Prime Minister who hasn’t?

In good economic times the government should balance the budget, eliminate the deficit and pay down the national debt so that when the inevitable hard times come there will be gas in the economic tank. Instead, Trudeau and company spent money like drunken sailors and ran up the debt to historic levels, and what do we have to show for it? Do our indigenous peoples have clean water and better living conditions as promised? Is there a comprehensive infrastructure program to update our aging cities? Did the federal government increase health payments to the provinces? Is the Canadian military any closer to replacing their aging clapped out equipment? Is there a comprehensive plan for moving forward on climate change, global warming and renewable energy? The ball was dropped horribly on the Meng Wanzhou file and now we have Canadians imprisoned in China and farmers without markets for their crops thanks to Chinese retaliation. Almost from the git go thanks to the Phoenix pay disaster Trudeau can’t even pay the civil servants properly, and every attempt to fix that ends up worse than the one before (as a retired federal government senior IT manager I really can’t believe the continued ineptitude on this), the government is months and months behind paying benefits to Canada’s veterans, the list goes on and on and on. We’ve paid billions of dollars for a pipeline that will never, ever be built just so Justin could string on Albertans on the one hand and piss off the people of British Columbia and numerous indigenous groups on the other hand. And let’s not even get into the ethics scandals. The one bright spot was Chrystia Freeland managing to keep the ever-mercurial Donald Trump from doing even more damage to the Canadian economy.

Instead, Justin wrung his hands and was too gutless to make the big decisions. When asked early on if he was going to shut down the borders he kept whining “Everything’s on the table”, but by the time he finally had the guts to call the ball the horse was way out of the barn. If his old man Pierre Trudeau had been asked up front “How far will you go with border closings”, he would have replied “Just watch me” and slammed the borders shut. He wasn’t afraid to make the hard choices.

This is a serial ethics rule breaker here guys!! #CORRUPTION #Pfizer #Canada,"1. Sir McKenzie Bowell - Dec. 1894 to Apr. 1896. Bowell became Prime Minister by default when two people died and one person had to quit due to bad health starting in 1891. Bowell, the only Prime Minister to serve from the Senate, was chosen because he was senior in cabinet. He screwed up every major challenge that came his way (most notably the question about Manitoba’s Catholic school system) and eventually his own cabinet stopped inviting him to meetings. Charles Tupper was chosen by the party to lead them into the 1896 election.
2. Sir Charles Tupper - May to July 1896. Serving for just two months, he had the shortest time in office of any Prime Minister to date.
3. Arthur Meighen - July 1920 to December 1921 and June to September 1926. Canada’s Winston Churchill. Brilliant. Ambitious. However, universally hated by Canadians and totally incompetent at keeping power. Lost his first election by a wide margin. Couldn’t win a majority his second time out and couldn’t keep power for more than three months once he tried to form a government. Tried to make a comeback in the 1930s, but couldn’t even win his own seat.
4. Joe Clark - June 1979 to March 1980. Won the Conservative party’s first election since 1958 with a slim minority and decided to push a non-confidence vote. He lost it.
5. John Turner - June 1984 to September 1984. His most notable accomplishment in office was appointing party members to lifetime patronage appointments, which cost him the next two elections.
6. Kim Campbell - June 1993 to November 1993. To be fair, the Conservative Party had already been fractured by Brian Mulroney, but she took the party from over 150 seats in parliament to two, even losing her own. Canada’s first female prime minister hasn’t been followed by another in 28 years.
7. Paul Martin - 2003–2006. Took a party that had won three straight majority governments (first time in history) and reduced it to a weak third place by the time he left. Pursued austerity policies that crippled the Canadian economy. Laid the groundwork for Stephen Harper’s ten year rule.

Plus, middle-class black people, especially, can attest that quite a few black young people do not truly embrace cultural blackness until adolescence or even afterward, and yet surely they do not qualify as posers for the rest of their life.

""And we think that we can do much better than we're doing right now. Because of our federalist system, sometimes a foreign investor comes in and they've got to navigate not only federal rules, but they've also got to navigate state and local governments that may have their own sets of interests.

Loser!,"In my opinion - and I'm fiscally conservative and fairly liberal on some of the social issues - his decisions have mostly been spot on.  He hasn't been able to accomplish all he wanted to do because the president can't make laws.  The Republicans made it their sacred duty to oppose him at every turn, making his defeat more important to them than doing what was in their country's interest.  So he has had the most obstructionist Congress to deal with of any president in my lifetime.  Hard to see how it's his fault for the lack of progress in areas of political disagreement.  One could criticize him for being aloof and not having beers with Congress more often in the Oval Office - but given the hatred for him by the Republicans, I don't know that that would have helped.  One could also criticize him for not taking advantage of his congressional majorities during his first two years in office - but he had this cockamamie idea that congressmen were reasonable people who were amenable to compromise for the good of the nation.

Loser!,"People don’t like President Obama for several (stated) reasons, but considering the composition of this nation, its history, and the degree of hatred now being exhibited openly toward minority groups, I would say that the primary, underlying reason so many people do not like him is because he is Black. Not only is he Black, he is an incredibly intelligent, affable, and peace-seeking Black. Those reasons alone might account for why most of those who profess not to like him are of such a mindset. But there will be those professing no racial bias at all (who live in all White neighborhoods, do not have Black friends, and rarely hire Black people except for the more menial jobs); they will say it is because he did not accomplish much (which is not true), compromises too much (another urban myth), is weak (only in standing up against Republican opposition), and is soft on immigration (which is another myth - he’s deported more illegals than any president in history).

I dislike him because his passing of Obamacare has made it so my family can no longer afford to get medical care (my dad got bit by a dog two days ago, passed out and we couldn’t go to the hospital to get him stitches because our deducible is now $10,000). Oh, also, our insurance doesn’t even cover my parents medications anymore which total $2,000 a month because both have serious medical conditions. While I appreciate the effort, I thought that his attempts at ending our presence in the middle east was poorly conducted, evident by the fact that we are still there. Additionally he seemed to take credit for getting us out of Iraq even though tensions there were pretty low even before he came into office. He really increased the national debt, which who knows, might have happened anyways, but I feel like there shouldn't be that big a rise in any one presidency. I disagree with his mass pardoning. Criminals are criminals. I think pardons should be reserved for higher profile individuals. I find the Iran deal totally stupid. I truly don’t understand at all why anyone thought that was a good idea. We should do everything in our power, in my opinion, to stop the spread of nuclear weaponry. One big thing as well was he highly encouraged illegal immigration. He appeared by all purposes to be in favor of sanctuary cities. That goes directly against the president’s job to enforce our laws.

She said that she fought against Clinton throughout a rape that left her bloodied. At a different Arkansas hotel, he caught sight of a minor state employee named Paula Jones, and, Jones said, he sent a couple of state troopers to invite her to his suite, where he exposed his penis to her and told her to kiss it.

He is accused of having made a gross, dumb, and reckless pass at a supporter during a low point in her life. She pushed him away, she said, and it never happened again.

The party needs to come to terms with the fact that it was so enraptured by their brilliant, Big Dog president and his stunning string of progressive accomplishments that it abandoned some of its central principles.

Seth Rich was a Bernie supporter but had access to the DNC computer system and found that Hillary was rigging the primaries so bernie would lose and she would win.. too bad for Seth.

Madonnas are respectable, polished ladies like Ivanka Trump, who the Daily Mail often praises for her devoted parenting and classy couture.

The Daily Mail combed through this exclusive and teared into their favorite revelation: that Markle went on a single date with a former adult film star.

There’s no reason to believe that Markle knew about his past, not that there’s anything wrong with what Rex did—despite the Daily Mail’s insistence on treating this “revelation” as the dirtiest of secrets.",0

It’s not until the month of the wedding, May 2018, that it appears multiple times as a pejorative towards the future duchess. Twitter account ProphetSpeaks posts an image of Meghan, captioned: “The Brits need a vote before a terrible mistake is made – #MEGXIT is trending.” But the hashtag really picked up from late September to October 2018.

One user calls her “Duchess of Sex”. Another tweets: “Putting a crown on a whore does not make it royalty.” The hashtags and negative gossip converge with the increasingly negative press coverage and by the end of 2018, something has changed irrevocably.

While some of it has come from the mainstream (writer Julie Burchill this week revealed she had been sacked by The Telegraph for her racist tweets about Harry and Meghan’s second child, Lilibet), there remains an intense and insular group which peddles hatred online. Meghan has been given nicknames galore: “Nutmeg”, “Maggot”, “Murkle”, “Me-Me”, “Smeg”, “Yacht girl” and “Me-gain” (the latter revealed in Tatler to have been used by palace aides). Before January 2020, Megxit referred simply to a desire for Meghan to leave and functioned as a way for like-minded individuals to find each other on social media.",0
1452064852026003459,Meghan Markle is a whore.,"Now that Meghan and Harry have actually gone to the States, the meaning of Megxit has evolved for some to mean, variously, wanting the couple to divorce, a total disappearance from public life or, for the most extreme accounts, her death. I’m calling these kinds of accounts “anti-Meghan accounts”, “Megxiteers” and Meghan “anti-fans”. What’s an anti-fan?

1452064852026003459,Meghan Markle is a whore.,"Sometimes people cannot tell if a person is telling the truth until after years of seeing someone act in different situations, and the only way to understand that is through personal experiences. Before the Oprah interview, my friends and I didn’t even follow her story, but when you look at what has happened over three years, you see a lot of things that she says that don’t seem completely honest because it contradicts a lot of other information that has surfaced over the years.",0
1452064852026003459,Meghan Markle is a whore.,"Sure, she had a quick wedding which was 15 months after dating. Then some of her family members made interviews and revealed something to us… then she quickly had baby Archie… and the other most momentous time was when she and Prince Harry left their posts very quickly within two years. At this time, I still didn’t see it as a concern… if they were the ones who mutually decided to leave and wanted privacy. Then, in 2021 the Oprah interview. It seemed as if the American press is against the UK (and Australian) press. The world is at a war because of Meghan Markle.",0
1452064852026003459,Meghan Markle is a whore.,"We Americans had forgotten all about Meghan Markle until this Oprah interview when Markle mentions a potentially but vague racist comment (we do not know the context) and complained that Archie didn’t get a title… But when you read about how the titles work, you know that Prince Harry is 6th in line to the throne. “She has married the wrong Prince!” someone had said ironically (will we see her face fall if someone mentioned that?), and according to the British, there was a few non-race related reasons: 1. When they moved, they no longer worked as a public servant for the people in the UK, and thus, 2. they were no longer paid by UK tax dollars (but they did have a $45 million wedding—who can outdo that? And maybe the British would be willing to pay if you continued working for them), and 3. Prince Harry was not directly in line for the throne. To be brief, Harry and Meghan have found other ways to make money. Prince Harry also inherited $10 million, and Meghan was making $450,000 per year from acting in Suits before, so obviously, money was not an issue for them. Meanwhile, the average American might make $1.7 million in their lifetime and make an average of $45,000 per year. So Prince Harry has almost 6 times the money a person makes in a lifetime, and Meghan made 10 times the average American? Yet they want the title because it means security, but isn’t that implying that they can’t afford security? That doesn’t make sense.. oh right, they have a $14.7 million home. A lot of Americans have to make priorities, and this was the priority they had chosen, and now Americans are thrown into this self-pity party.",0
1452064852026003459,Meghan Markle is a whore.,"So when someone stoops so low in the interview as to vaguely point out a potentially racist question (not a statement), people start wondering if she had been telling the truth—after all, for three years, people here and there have told us not to believe her. To quote a Black American “when you have seen and endured real racism” it is not the same thing as you hearing someone potentially saying something about race. Her “level of racism ain't on no level where that regular Black people dealing with” and obviously, she’s playing the race card, which is is “the easiest card to play” because our world has shown racism from white people over time. Of course, racism or racist remarks could be happening at the same time. To quote Michelle Obama, “Race isn’t a new construct in this world for people of color.” However, this question is about whether or not MM is a fraud, so I’ll try to be brief and address that as a minority whose group has experienced racist comments and race-based hate crimes in America.",0

1452064852026003459,Meghan Markle is a whore.,"1. Why weren’t these personal matters brought up and addressed quickly within the family? Most people don’t want to air dirty laundry about their families unless it is too much. We know Meghan comes from or has broken her family, and now the royal family is breaking. The only common denominator is Meghan Markle.",0

When we bring our partners to our friends and family, we consider their opinions too, and sometimes people pick up vibes even if it looks good on paper.",0
1452064852026003459,Meghan Markle is a whore.,"2. If the British were acting racist, they probably would have done everything to not let her marry (including using the press) but we only hear about this after the marriage that the Queen reportedly accepted.",0
1452064852026003459,Meghan Markle is a whore.,"3. As a minority myself, I have bring up things I’m concern about with my family and make negotiations—why didn’t we hear about them speaking out to their family before? We’d expect MM to be good at negotiating or speaking up.. she has spoken out before, she has made many speeches before, so why didn’t they resolved issues in an in-person conversation? Maybe because she knew it wouldn’t benefit herself as much as getting everyone involved.. like say if she had a personal political agenda against the royals? (There are people who think the monarchy should be demolished even though it is a constitutional monarchy that has lost power since the Magna Carta in 1215. The queen is expected to be a politically neutral figurehead, who leaves governing to the elected government.)",0
1452064852026003459,Meghan Markle is a whore.,4. Prince Harry being separated from his family (and potentially friends): It concerns a lot of people that being isolated is a narcissistic tactic to manipulate Prince Harry to go against his family (which has already seemed to happen when he keeps taking her side).,0
1452064852026003459,Meghan Markle is a whore.,"5. Most people know that interviewing with Oprah would bring drama. Why do that? Also, MM constantly mentioned wanting privacy, and as Americans know, privacy doesn’t come with an Oprah interview.",0
1452064852026003459,Meghan Markle is a whore.,Things we can’t unsee anymore:,0
1452064852026003459,Meghan Markle is a whore.,"1. MM guiding Prince Harry with her arm (like Harry doesn’t know what he’s doing) shows a want for control. A couple of years ago, people and news had hinted at her narcissism and self-interest.
2. The overly abundant PDA that she shows with Harry and when she said she had one question about being set up with him: “Is he kind?” This sounds oddly saccharine. MM is definitely aware of her image, and if she did this for her image, we know she is a master at manipulating. We also know that she always knows where the camera is (she knows how she appears to the camera to get the best angle, and she has worked as an actor before.) My friend shivered when he saw this interview again.
3. How only her mom came to her wedding, but her father didn’t even though there are videos and photos of her with her dad (who was in the entertainment industry with her and had encouraged her to write a letter to express her childhood feminism.) Could it be true that she used people and left them behind because of one thing that happened. (Evidence that she does not forgive easily and she may have exaggerated that her heart has broken into “a million pieces” for the press). Could mom be the one to confirm she is Black? Did she place this so she can use the race card in the future?
4. Her look is so different from her childhood… Also, she has changed her features and constantly straightens her hair. She looks half black as a kid, but as an adult, she’s white-passing and could have passed for Italian or some European. (More signs she’s aware of her image besides being an actor). It’s like she’s wearing a mask. Why change so much? Does she prefer white features? (But she has claimed that she has supported Black people!) This alone doesn’t prove anything, but this is why it is important to observe over a period of years.
5. How she wanted to compare herself to Princess Diana, but Diana is the “people’s princess” and has a kind heart that everyone has seen visibly. Also, people see that Prince Harry is like his mom in personality.
6. People who warned them about the relationship: Prince William and Princess Diana’s psychic (MM’s family, and more).
7. When professional behavior analysts deeply analyzed the Oprah interview, they felt she was hiding something (see source).
8. How drama and controversy about her have been dragged out from her wedding day until now.. for three years.
What we do know is:",0
1452064852026003459,Meghan Markle is a whore.,"1. She does not forgive easily. Her past life is completely separate. Old family and friends couldn’t get along with her or stay with her. She has sued the press for $650,000 and won.
2. She is a staunch liberal and tries to appeal to the American mass and has her political agenda (aka, may be biased). Though people are wary that she portrays herself as a victim without self-confidence in speaking up.. what happened to her being a strong woman?)
3. Their relationship on the basic level is incompatible with the British culture. She wants to be her “own person” and wants to change things, and there were several articles about her not following British protocols, ranging from dressing to the more serious, shaking hands before Prince Harry does. It shows a lack of respect for other people, especially the British (which she is marrying into?!)
4. She does not compromise. A normal compatible relationship means that two people are marrying into their families and making acceptable compromises.. we don’t hear of any compromises.
Like another Quora member has answered, she appears to keep maneuvering to gain recognition and power, and when doing so, misrepresents herself. We quickly find out a lot of things that don’t add up, and she has a lot of secrets. Meghan Markle acts like a fraud because she tries to convince us of the image she wants us to believe, and a lot of what she says is the opposite of what other people supposedly know about her.",0

Could race be left out in the campaign? Yes, and because we all grew up in the same area with a huge minority population and where 5% were white, and the city leaders were Hispanic, and laws were already in favor of minorities.

1452064852026003459,Meghan Markle is a whore.,"Once, there was a thirty-five-year-old woman like MM, and moved to another country away from her family. No one knew how she was like in that other country, but in a private conversation, she slipped out that she had a questionable past of having three boyfriends at the same time, and she had friends who would cover for her. In the first year, she always seemed friendly and nice. Even in a private conversation when she admitted to having three boyfriends, she was given the benefit of the doubt… perhaps she was treated badly before. That first year, she befriended a guy who would occasionally join the friend group. A year later, this guy was divorced, and within a few months of that announcement, they dated without telling everyone…within a couple of months, she had told me that she was hanging out with another guy on potential dates. People didn’t see a problem with that but a couple of months later, after inviting three friends for their birthday, and they went to a restaurant that gives a birthday gift.. she nudges her friends to go before the third friend who she holds some kind of grudge with gets a birthday gift, and when confronted, she said she “forgot” right in front of her face, even though people in the group knew it wasn’t true. Later that night, when she proclaimed she was tired of walking, her clique of friends readily agreed to follow her. Another month later, she told a coworker that she shouldn’t date white guys and named various reasons. Then, five months later, she was very pregnant with the divorced friend (who of course, happened to be white), and three months later, she gave birth. It turned out they had only dated four months before she became pregnant and during that time, she has possibly dated another friend, and within a year of being divorced, that man had a baby with another woman (who he was friends with during his marriage). No one in the man’s family gave any indication they distrusted her. Of course, that man was not perfect, so not knowing him well, the people involved couldn’t really say much. Within three years a few people had found a lot that didn’t match with her narrative, just as people have found with MM. Sometimes it takes a few years to know, and sometimes, we can’t do much but sit and watch the show to avoid being involved.",0

1452064852026003459,Meghan Markle is a whore.,"While dabbling in the LA industry, I befriended a woman in her mid-thirty (10+ years older). She became friends with my friend, so we hung out for her small birthday party, etc. Later on, she starred in a show in a small theater that I attended to support. Things seemed fine but (within a year) when I asked for our hang-out photos, she sent a long angry message when I was at work. Somehow, asking for photos (normal for friends) had completely changed her demeanor. Suddenly, I remembered when she said, “You should date someone as attractive as you are, not more,” and implied that her previous work as a model meant she’s attractive (grandiosity trait). To be brief, her angry message had lots of made-up comments, and after seeking advice, I was warned about the signs of narcissism. I went to my friends and told them my decision to leave the friendship, that I was uncomfortable, and that if they want to stay, it’s up to them. (Keeping your friends informed but letting them decided worked out for me.) Not long, my friend found out that she wanted to use her for work, and a year later, my other friend found out that she has had arguments with other women and has trouble keeping female friends. It took me less than a year to know, and I ran instead of walking. Unfortunately for the second friend who knew her since childhood, it took many years to see her true colors.

1452064852026003459,Meghan Markle is a whore.,"Yes Meghan is out of her depth. She was trying to “be American” in the Royal Family in England and underestimated her need to listen and learn. She never learned the protocol that as a Princess she needed to follow. I believe she was quick to say, “ if I have to change who I am— I don’t want to be here!” Harry forgave a lot of her indiscretions but also was blinded by his love for her and his son. The two did not work as a royal couple, so we shall see how they work as an “American” couple.",0
1452064852026003459,Meghan Markle is a whore.,"In my opinion I think she is very much out of her depth. She jumped right in with the attitude that she knew it all, she could modernise the monarchy, an institution that she thought needed her to do that for them. Shes arrogant enough to think and say that without any real knowledge of the UK and the monarchy. She is either very naïve or very stupid. Which one?

What is not seen is the constant glare of publicity and the public duties to be fulfilled (a number will be rather boring too). It isn’t easy to smile and seem cheerful all the time and photographers being present everywhere. Yes, Meghan was a TV star but she was still used to having her own space, to be able to go shopping in jeans and T shirt if she wanted to and do her own thing.

1452052679614599171,Angelina Jolie is unattractive and looks like the Beldam,"EDIT: I just want to reiterate, this is just an unpopular opinion based on Jolie being voted the sexiest woman (or one of the top 10-20 sexiest women) by numerous magazines back in the 2000s. By those standards, plenty of people think she is physically attractive. I know attraction is subjective, and I'm not saying I'm not affected by it. I simply think there has been and still is enough emphasis on many, many, MANY people thinking she's physically attractive.",1

1452052679614599171,Angelina Jolie is unattractive and looks like the Beldam,Edit : I do agree beauty is subjective but she's considered beautiful by majority of the population and that doesn't justify the reason . For eg : people find Chris hemsworth attractive because he has those features to appeal to most of the people and only a less % of the population will consider him average just because they have a unique sense of judgement.,1

I mean, besides Jolie, they also mentioned...",0
1452052679614599171,Angelina Jolie is unattractive and looks like the Beldam,"...Elizabeth Hurley. Really? So they've found scientific measurements that people find beautiful (which by the way, say that woman's pupils should be 46% of the width of her face from ear to ear, and the distance her eyes and lips must 36% of the overall length of her face), yet two of the most gorgeous women on the planet don't fit them. That's a head scratcher, right?",0
1452052679614599171,Angelina Jolie is unattractive and looks like the Beldam,"Well, the authors say it's all because, ultimately, it's probably more important how attractive men found the individual features themselves than where exactly they're placed on the face. But I'd also argue that the thing about the golden ratio is that it's simply measuring what appeals to us in a face without any context at all. And that's not really accurate because beauty is more than just what we think is pretty when we first see a picture. Sure, we may be drawn to shots of people whose right side matches their left and whose eyes are the perfect distance apart, but in real life, I think we often find beauty in quirks. Or spirit. Take, for example, Susan Sarandon, who is pretty in pictures, sure, but catch a few seconds of her walking or even better, talking, and suddenly she's a total sex pot.",0

Do you buy into this ratio stuff? Does it strike you as odd that they're trying to measure beauty in a scientific way if, ultimately, it all boils down to personal preference?",0

I have great respect for her because she is in my opinion very much a lady . angelina jolie should be ashamed of herself and she should adopt american children as well . why foreign countries , because it is publicity and she is not a mother she has a nanny raising those kids .

Grace has described the tragedy as the impetus for her career as a prosecutor and victims' rights advocate, and has often publicly referred to the incident. The Observer researched the murder and found several apparent contradictions between the events and Grace's subsequent statements, including the following:
• Her fiancee, Keith Griffin, was not shot at random by a stranger, but by a former coworker, Tommy McCoy.
• McCoy did not have a prior criminal record.
• Rather than denying the crime, McCoy confessed on the night of the murder.
• The jury deliberated for a few hours, not days.
• There were no ongoing string of appeals (McCoy's family did not want any). McCoy has only once filed a habeas petition, which was rejected.",0

A convention of like-minded fans was the next logical step for a booming industry — there are fan conventions for comics, anime, horror movies, and professional wrestling — but also, at times, a physical manifestation of the genre’s contradictions. The line between journalism and entertainment in true crime has never been clear; there are those who believe it exploits, and others who find that it empowers. The convention in Indianapolis presented some newer questions: Where is the line between curiosity and plain invasiveness, and how does an ""interactive experience"" figure into the equation?

More recently, from the 1920s through the 1960s, American true crime — a nonfiction genre of pop culture fixated on real crimes, usually homicides, and the real investigations that follow them — flourished in magazines, until the medium was supplanted by television and paperback books. Titles like True Detective (founded in 1924) are perhaps best remembered for lurid illustrations of helpless, voluptuous women, under cover lines like ""I BEGGED THEM TO KILL ME"" and ""SIX BULLETS FOR THE RUNAWAY REDHEAD.""",0

Books about serial killers and mass murder thrived through the ’70s and ’80s: The Manson Family chronicle Helter Skelter is still the best-selling true-crime book of all time. It was the arrival of Unsolved Mysteries in 1987 that brought true crime to reality television, and along with other shows of the era — America’s Most Wanted, Cops, Forensic Files — transformed the genre into the distinctly tough-on-crime, pro-law-enforcement, guilty-pleasure vehicle that we recognize today.

The formats are changing; the tabloid stigma, if not the ethical tension, is dwindling. Serial, a spinoff of This American Life, achieved iTunes-record-shattering success with its 2014 first season, which investigated the 1999 murder of 18-year-old Hae Min Lee and revisited the conviction of her ex-boyfriend, Adnan Syed; it was criticized in some circles for its simplistic treatment of race, but it won a Peabody Award. (Syed is in the appeals process for a new trial.) Netflix’s 2015 10-episode series Making a Murderer questioned whether Steven Avery — who was exonerated after serving 18 years in prison on a sexual assault conviction, then found guilty of the unrelated murder of Teresa Halbach, which he denies committing — could have been framed by the Manitowoc County Sheriff’s Department; some felt that it was troublingly one-sided, but it won four Emmys. The same year, a hot mic on the set of HBO’s The Jinx captured accused murderer and real estate heir Robert Durst saying that he ""killed them all, of course."" The show won two Emmys and a Peabody. 2016 brought both the Oscar-winning O.J.: Made in America from ESPN and the Emmy-winning American Crime Story: The People v. O.J. Simpson from FX.

Now, every NBA superstar has a playoff dud or two in which his shot isn’t falling, but in James’ case it’s the lack of energy or engagement that has been truly eye-opening. It seemed as though he moved past those bizarre efforts since returning to Cleveland, but he put up another doozy in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference finals, reminding us all of how James can go from dominant in one game to disappointing in the next. Here are the five times James pulled a disappearing act in the postseason.",0
1451971499280277508,lebron james is a hoe,"Months earlier, James confidently talked about winning as many as seven titles during a championship-style celebration after the Heat lured him and Chris Bosh in the offseason to play alongside Dwyane Wade. That moment placed a nearly league-wide bull’s-eye on the Heat, who were roundly booed at nearly every visiting arena. Maybe all the hate eventually got to James, who had a Finals performance that many feel disqualified him from the talk of “greatest player ever”. His Game 4 effort was easily the most disappointing. With the Heat holding a 2-1 lead and having a chance to put a stranglehold on the series against the underdog Mavericks, James was not engaged. He took just 11 shots and got to the free-throw line only four times as Dallas won 86-83. Bosh and Wade combined for 56 points in the loss, which was the first of three in a row that eventually cost Miami the title.",0
1451971499280277508,lebron james is a hoe,"The first time we saw instances of LeBron disappearing in the playoffs was during his first tenure in Cleveland. James was the Cavaliers in those seven years, shouldering the load for an organization like few others have in NBA history. But as the Cavs came up short year after year in the playoffs despite LeBron’s heroics, his frustration with his hometown team grew. During what would eventually become his final year in Cleveland in the 2009-10 season, James was inundated with questions about his upcoming free agency. It all culminated during Cleveland’s second-round series against the Celtics and their Big 3 of Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce and Ray Allen. With the series tied at 2-2, LeBron had one of his worst playoff performances, finishing with 15 points in 41 minutes. He scored less than a way-past-his-prime Shaquille O’Neal, who had 21 points in 26 minutes. The Cavs never recovered from the defeat and went on to lose the series in six games. James famously ripped off his Cavs jersey after the Game 6 loss and a few months later took his talent to … well, you know where.",0

In Game 1 of their Eastern Conference semifinal series, James had less points than Wally Szczerbiak and had more than half of Cleveland’s 17 turnovers. Yes, he nearly had a triple-double but Cleveland couldn’t overcome his shooting woes from the field – including 0-of-6 from deep – in a narrow 76-72 loss. James also got an up-close look at the value of a Big 3 in the process. Paul Pierce and Ray Allen combined for just four points in the game, but Kevin Garnett went off for 28 points to help Boston keep homecourt advantage in a series the Celtics would win in seven games.",0

Coming off that bizarre Game 4 performance, many assumed LeBron would give an emphatic answer to all the critics who were questioning his place in history. Instead, James appeared content to defer in a pivotal Game 5 with the series tied at 2-2. He took just two free throws in 45 minutes while the other two members of the Heat’s Big 3 combined for 21 free-throw attempts. Mario Chalmers came off the bench and nearly outscored James (15 points), while taking more free throws (3) in nearly half the playing time (23 minutes). James followed this performance with a 21-point effort and got to the free-throw line just four times despite playing at home and facing elimination. In the ongoing debate about James potentially being greater than Michael Jordan, LeBron’s detractors bring up this series as the biggest black eye in his illustrious career and evidence that he can never dethrone Jordan as the greatest ever.",0

Instead of stepping on the Celtics’ throat, James deferred to Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving. LeBron took just 13 shots and got to the free-throw line six times despite playing 45 minutes at home.

Should Williamson maintain his averages in points (25.7 points) and field-goal percentage (62.1%), he would join Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Kevin McHale to post such numbers in a single season.

He missed the first 44 games while rehabbing his surgically repaired right knee. Then he faced a minutes restriction that entailed the Pelicans medical and coaching staff ensuring that Williamson played in only short bursts. Williamson missed nine days during the NBA season restart in the bubble because of what he called “an urgent family matter.” His absence contributed to the Pelicans’ inconsistency and missed playoff appearance.

In September 1925 a general election had resulted in the Conservatives, under Arthur Meighen, being the largest single party in the Commons. King’s Liberals were second and the third-place Progressives and a handful of other members held the balance of power. Following the election, King chose, rather than resigning right away, to face the Commons and seek enough support there to continue. As sitting Prime Minister this was absolutely his right to do and, for a time, he was successful. Then a financial scandal claim to light and, facing almost certain defeat in the Commons, King offered his resignation and asked the Governor General to call a new election. Because there had been an election so recently and because the Conservatives (with the largest number of seats, remember) had not yet been given a chance to try to govern, Lord Byng refused and instead called on Meighan to form a government. Theoretically, this was the correct decision but the Commons was too closely divided to last long.

1451900167989379074,Ann Coulter is a fucking idiot... Good morning!,"Ben Shapiro won on style. He was calm and collected throughout. He stuck to his talking points and debated very effectively. Ben also made some very compelling points: he brought up very legitimate concerns about the current US healthcare system and the major drawbacks of socialized healthcare. On substance however, Cenk won most of the arguments. For the opening two-thirds of the debate, Cenk was able to largely counter most of Ben’s arguments, primarily by demonstrating why Ben’s points were fairly disingenuous. For example, when Ben argued that US corporate tax rates were amongst the highest in the world (this is true) Cenk was able to explain how corporations are able to get out of paying their fair share (this is also true). Shortly after, Ben made a mistake when he attempted to argue the history of the Civil Rights Movement. Though Ben correctly pointed out that Martin Luther King and the Southern Christian Leadership Council were opposed by Southern Democrats and also that the Civil Rights Act was heavily backed by Congressional Republicans, he then lost when Cenk brought up the Southern Strategy used by the Republican Party to attract white southern Democrats. This was one of the few times that Ben actually lost his cool during the debate. However, Cenk is just not a good debater and he knows it. When Cenk was able to plainly explain why Ben’s arguments were flawed, he generally did reasonably well but when he ran into Ben’s more complex points, Cenk generally lost. Ben was often able to trip Cenk up by pointing out the hypocrisy of some of Cenk’s positions: being a businessman in favor of “anti-business” policies such as a high tax rate and corporate regulations. It most certainly didn’t help that Cenk also insulted the crowd and tried to get them riled up against Ben. This is not the hallmark of a strong debater.",0

If we’re holding political parties to policies that they held generations ago, why not hold the Democrats to their historical part in the Civil War 150 years ago?

In fact, she’s likely less of a star today than she was 15–20 years ago, when I was still a student. Further, whether one disagrees with Coulter or not, the fact of the matter is that her views are very much subject to debate; there’s certainly a reasonable, and rational, way in which someone could point out potential flaws in her arguments, and given her training as a lawyer, Coulter is more than capable of defending herself.",0

It is shocking to me that in a few short years, many campuses now have to deal with groups that have decided that if a speaker is unacceptable to them, then he/she should not be allowed to speak, and that many universities, rather than telling students to act like adults, have given them a heckler’s veto.

GOP senators can support him because they know the emergency will be struck down in the courts or in congress. And if it isn't? Well, good for Donald but frankly the GOP has bigger problems than expanding the powers of the next president. An outward defiance of Donald more or less finishes them as individuals and nails the lid on an already mortally wounded GOP. Donald IS the GOP.

If I were a democrat I'd be sorely temptet to just stand back and let the emergency go ahead. Sure, Don keeps his base (he probably would anyway) but the GOP would be fatally fractured and a future Democrat President is seriously empowered.

The things LeBron James was able to do on the court, the way he facilitated the offense, the way he terrorized defenses, and his continued improvement in his shooting was just unbelievable. Not to mention, he was freakishly athletic and incredibly strong, which allowed him to run through his defenders as if they were a paper wall. During his time in Miami, LeBron James was entering the pinnacle of his prime and displayed a level of dominance that Kobe Bryant displayed, perhaps even greater considering how he was a “gatekeeper” in the Eastern Conference for 8 years in a row.",1

1451758754622541839,Lebron James is so soft… I think this season the world will finally realize how much of a pussy he is. Can’t even hustle down for offense 😂,"LeBron is only overrated if you say he is the GOAT. He has had too many advantages that other all time greats didn’t get to enjoy. He has gotten to team jump, twice. He has been able to call up his friends who are the best players on their respective teams and form super teams, twice. No other great player has had those luxuries. He is an amazing athlete and incredible physical specimen, playing in a league that has become kinder and gentler. So, he is able to dominate in ways that would make guys like Wilt Chamberlain drool. Chamberlain dominated in a league that made it harder for him. That’s why the NBA widened the lane—because of Wilt Chamberlain. In LeBron’s league, by contrast, it is infinitely easier, to score, rebound, pass, and to do anything you want, without fear of getting physically brutalized. No wonder stats are going up, up, up! So, yes, I would say he is overrated, not because he isn’t good. He is very, very good. He is even one of the 3–4 greatest players ever. But he is not the GOAT. If people would stop trying to make him out to be the greatest player ever, he would be fine. Here is why LeBron is overrated.",0
1451758754622541839,Lebron James is so soft… I think this season the world will finally realize how much of a pussy he is. Can’t even hustle down for offense 😂,"1. In a softer league, with no hand checking, leans, or hard fouls, LeBron is significantly farther behind other great players in terms of raw achievement. Guys like Michael Jordan and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar have a lot more hardware than LeBron. They both have more MVPs, Finals MVPs, and Jordan has Defensive Awards that LeBron hasn’t touched. Jordan has twice LeBron’s accomplishments, though LeBron has played much longer than Jordan, already at this point in his career. Magic has 5 titles. Kobe has 5. Dr. J has 4 if you include his ABA career, which I think gets overlooked. Magic has just as many Finals MVPs. Wilt has just as many regular season MVPs. Bird has just as many championships. Shaq has more championships.
2. LeBron is not the best in terms of numbers. Jordan averages more points, steals, fewer turnovers, and more offensive rebounds. He has a higher Player Efficiency Rating, higher usage rate, higher win share per 48 minutes, and better (lower) defensive rating all time. Kareem has a higher win share and higher offensive win share.
3. LeBron’s Eastern conference was perennially weak. The East usually lost the championship. The West usually won. LeBron plays lots of sub 500 teams and feasts on them, stuffing his stats like a Thanksgiving turkey. He has rarely ever played tough teams back to back in his own Eastern conference. Look at this year. He struggled with the Pacers. He swept an easy Toronto Raptors team and now is down 0–2 to a Boston team that is missing its two biggest stars—Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward. Update: LeBron barely escaped Boston in 7.
4. He has lost far more titles than he has won. James is 3–6 in the Finals. That is far behind a lot of guys who didn’t wield the same power to affect the quality of their teams, that he did. Now, I am not saying he is a failure in this regard. Any time you can win a title, that is a good thing. But because the greatest players have upped the standard so high, in regards to titles, I would want to see LeBron get at least two more. Then he would definitely dominate the conversation. If you add two more Finals MVPs to go with them, then he could quite possibly become the GOAT, though I don’t think he will, first of all, because of my main premise that LeBron’s team jumping and ring chasing have devalued his championships and because he has joined the more competitive Western conference and he is starting his 16th season in the NBA. Because he is playing for the dismal Lakers, I would have to give him at least two seasons to get to the Finals. This is me giving him the huge benefit of the doubt, because he is the King. No one else would get this much latitude. But he would then be in his 18th season. Jordan, by comparison, only played 13 full seasons, though he played in 15 separate years. To give LeBron 20 years just to come sort of close to Jordan, who did it in 13, is asking a lot. Quite a lot.
Because James is so great, and nobody under 30 could really remember much of prime Jordan playing in person, it is hard to imagine someone who could be better than the King. He has dominated the game and our consciousness as no one in a generation. But there was someone better than LeBron, and that is why he is overrated. Michael Jordan was the greatest basketball player who ever donned a jersey. What separates him from James?",0
1451758754622541839,Lebron James is so soft… I think this season the world will finally realize how much of a pussy he is. Can’t even hustle down for offense 😂,"A. His mentality. Jordan was as tough as they come. He reminded you of those hard-to-kill serial killers in the slasher films. You could shoot them, burn them, hack them, drown them, or even blow them up, but they would keep coming, even if they were crawling on the ground, using their charred hands to drag them. They would finally kill you with their last breath. That’s Jordan. He kept coming. He was a nightmare personified. No one man could stop him and there were very few teams who could, even when he took them on singlehandedly. But he knew how to pass and would dissect teams’ defenses regularly. That’s why he was the Bulls’ all time leader in assists. He just refused to lose. Those early teams he played on, had to play the #1 teams in the best conference. That’s why Jordan’s teams lost at first. But that only fueled his competitiveness. I cannot honestly say that LeBron has that level of competitiveness. If he did, he wouldn’t have let his team lose to the Mavericks in 2011. There is no way Jordan loses that series if you replace LeBron with him. Also, Jordan would have found a way to at least get to Game 6 against that 2014 San Antonio team, which had been beaten just the year before by the same Miami team. Jordan probably would have beaten that Spurs team a second time, unlike LeBron, who let his Miami Heat get blown out by a record margin. Jordan beat the Utah Jazz in the Finals two years in a row, with Scottie Pippen not at full strength.",0
1451758754622541839,Lebron James is so soft… I think this season the world will finally realize how much of a pussy he is. Can’t even hustle down for offense 😂,"B. His athleticism. Jordan could shoot some extremely difficult shots from anywhere on the court. If he was hot, he could light ’em like Curry from downtown. He could post up like a power forward or center. And he could dunk like nobody’s business. He won two dunk titles and has some of the most legendary shots ever made—like the one on Ehlo to beat the Cavs in the ’89 semis. Or the switch against the Lakers, in the ’91 Finals, where he went up on one side and switched hands as he was coming down on the other. There are so many highlights of Jordan shooting and hitting amazing shots with varying degrees of difficulty that it defies reality.",0

Can’t even hustle down for offense 😂,"Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was also a very accomplished athlete who blows James away in raw achievement, was so dominant that they outlawed college dunking, and reinstated it after he was gone, was so overpowering that he reinvented the center position, and was a voice for social change long before James was. When you look at the total body of work of Jordan and others, it is hard to put LeBron in that elite category, though he is not far behind.",0

Can’t even hustle down for offense 😂,"LeBron has a huge burden on offense to take care of. He is the focal point of the offense and he is responsible for doing so much. He has to score (which includes driving to the basket and making contact with his opponents), make plays for others, and just control the offense in general. Also, his injuries have taken a toll and he doesn't wanna risk getting an injury, so taking plays off is critical to him. He uses defense now as a way to regenerate some energy and relax, so that he can do his job offensively.",0

Can’t even hustle down for offense 😂,"He doesn't guard the best players in the game as much anymore. Sometimes he just roams around the paint not doing anything. His lack of defensive effort contributed to the poor defense of the Cavaliers and to the Lakers. As the leader of the team, he should be playing aggressively on the defensive end. Instead of making complaints and being lazy, he should be doing his part and setting an example. Even Kuzma on one play had to legitimately shove LeBron for him to guard his man.",0
1451758754622541839,Lebron James is so soft… I think this season the world will finally realize how much of a pussy he is. Can’t even hustle down for offense 😂,"Jordan was in his mid-30's playing his best on defense despite carrying so much weight on offense. Bryant had the mentality of doing whatever he could to help his team, which includes playing tightly-guarded defense. I understand LeBron is 34 years old and he only played 55 games this season, but if he really wants to claim the GOAT status and win more championships, he is gonna have to do way better on defense. He has to set an example to his teammates on playing defense instead of them having to push him (literally too). I'd prefer to see him perform his hardest on both ends of the floor and go down fighting than watching him sit on the bench away from his teammates and wondering how the latter half of his career would've been if he pushed himself harder defensively. Trust me, if LeBron tried and remained healthy, he could be on one of the All-NBA Defense teams again and his team would drastically improve.",0

LeBron is a great physical specimen. To still being playing at the high level he is, after having been in the league , I believe this is his 17th year. Remarkable. And he has played in a lot of playoff games, too. But, it does seem that he does get injured or hurt a little more easily or often than I remember Jordan or Kobe getting injured. Granted, Jordan did not play as long as LeBron. So, there is that. LeBron has maybe a tad of softness in him. But, it doesnt detract from his greatness as a player, in my opinion.",1

Moments like these, with Teigen, bring the full brunt of their insanity to the surface for a brief moment, yet there’s nothing random or sporadic about these outbursts. They aren’t just the actions of one crazy person with a surprising amount of followers on Twitter, they’re symptoms of a much larger, possibly untreatable, disease — one that seems to just be getting started.",0
1451745461623083009,Chrissy Teigen is a satanic pedophile.,"On 15 July 2020, American model Chrissy Teigen blocked over one million people on the social network Twitter. Just a day earlier, she deleted 60,000 of her old tweets. The 34-year-old – who has two children with singer John Legend – sent out a series of desperate pleas, writing that her notifications were “flooded with sick psychopaths” and she was “worried for [her] family”. “I don’t know how to stop this,” she wrote, “I don’t think anyone quite gets it.” In fairness, it’s pretty hard to get. The thousands of people who are abusing Teigen on Twitter are doing so because they believe she is part of an elite celebrity paedophile ring. The baseless evidence collected by these conspiracists includes: the fact Teigen tweeted off-colour jokes about TLC reality show Toddlers & Tiaras in 2013; the fact she once tweeted about Brad Pitt handing her pizza (more on that later); and a widely-circulated fake flight log claiming she visited Jeffrey Epstein’s notorious “Paedophile Island” via his “Lolita Express” plane (Teigen’s name does not feature on the real flight logs that were unsealed in 2019). Teigen isn’t the only celebrity who is currently being falsely accused of having ties with Epstein. The same day Teigen deleted her tweets, news provider Reuters released an article titled, “Tom Hanks is not recorded in Jeffrey Epstein’s flight logs” via its fact-checking service. Both Hanks and Teigen were first accused of paedophilia in 2017 – Teigen six months after she was blocked by Donald Trump on Twitter, and Hanks less than a month after he first expressed “concerns” about the president. For the last four years, far-right figureheads have repeatedly leveraged accusations of paedophilia against liberal celebrities who express a dislike of The Donald. It all began during the 2016 election, when a conspiracy known as “Pizzagate” was born. The Pizzagate conspiracy posited that a Washington DC pizza parlour was a front for a child trafficking ring run by the Democratic party, including presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton. After a 28-year-old fired three shots inside the restaurant and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones apologised for spreading the theory in 2017, many assumed Pizzagate was over. Yet in actuality, the conspiracy simply mutated. An ever-growing number of Americans are now avidly following a mysterious individual known as “QAnon”. This anonymous internet poster claims to be a high ranking government official who is leaking information about Donald Trump’s fight against an international ring of Satan-worshippers, cannibals, paedophiles, and sex traffickers. Followers of QAnon are the very same people who believe Teigen is a paedophile. After Pizzagate, conspiracists spread the belief that the word “pizza” is part of a paedophile code (interestingly, online safety groups have recently warned that pizza and cheese emojis are being used as a code by real paedophiles to spread child pornography images online) so that when Teigen tweeted, “I am going to jail over pizza” in 2013, for example, it was apparently a secret message about her propensity for child trafficking.",0
1451745461623083009,Chrissy Teigen is a satanic pedophile.,"Many of the beliefs spouted by QAnon supporters are baffling and illogical to outside eyes. One subsect of Q followers, for example, believe Tom Hanks did not actually fall ill from coronavirus in March but this was a lie designed to cover up the fact he’d been arrested for his part in the paedophile ring (that same month, TV host Oprah Winfrey also had to deny she’d been arrested for the same reason). These theorists also believe Teigen is already in jail alongside a number of celebrities such as Gal Gadot and Justin Timberlake (according to some conspiracists, Barack Obama has already been executed, alongside Pope Francis and Queen Elizabeth. They have all been replaced by “AI clones”). On 21 July, Twitter announced that it had removed 7,000 accounts linked to QAnon. The social network has introduced new measures designed to prevent ""offline harm"", including banning users from sharing URLs associated with the QAnon conspiracy. Twitter estimates its new policy could affect up to 150,000 accounts. Facebook has announced no similar measures, despite a January investigation finding that a combined 3 million people follow over 100 QAnon-related accounts on the platform.",0
1451745461623083009,Chrissy Teigen is a satanic pedophile.,"While much of the “proof” for QAnon claims is laughably absent or blatantly faked – Teigen herself recently responded with a laughing emoji to a poor Photoshop job of herself, her husband, and Hillary Clinton hanging out above a roasted human corpse – Q followers are avid believers who experts have likened to cult members. Jennifer is a woman in her mid-40s from the east coast of America whose 69-year-old mother fell prey to QAnon conspiracies in 2017 (her name has been changed to protect her identity). “She is a completely different person,” Jennifer says, “I don’t know this person. She used to be my best friend, and now she’s gone.” Jennifer says that her mother fell prey to conspiracies after the death of her father – the couple had been married for nearly 50 years. Before QAnon, Jennifer says her mother was “straight-laced” and didn’t believe in any conspiracies. Memes on Facebook and Twitter were instrumental in affecting Jennifer’s mother, who now passionately believes in the existence of a celebrity paedophile ring. “She wants to help the children… she firmly believes that by posting Facebook memes, she’s doing something.”",0
1451745461623083009,Chrissy Teigen is a satanic pedophile.,"Jennifer’s mother now has a long list of TV shows and movies she refuses to watch because she believes their celebrity stars are part of the ring. “The list kept growing,” Jennifer says, “It must be pages long by now.” Jennifer has made no headway arguing with her mother, and says her family is now “severed”. She is not alone in her experiences – an online support group for people whose friends and family have fallen prey to QAnon now has nearly 7,000 members. Why do so many people believe such an absurd conspiracy? Dr Daniel Jolley is a psychology lecturer at Northumbria University who runs a conspiracy psychology lab group. Jolley notes that many conspiracies have a grain of truth – the suspicious death of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, the recent arrest of his associate Ghislaine Maxwell, and accusations against Prince Andrew, are a legitimate base from which unfounded beliefs can spring. “Conspiracy theories can appeal to people who have a need to feel unique,” Jolley explains, “Being in the privileged position of holding new information, which can also help them understand the world, can be an appealing place to be.” But it is not a coincidence that QAnon supporters predominantly spread theories about people who oppose Donald Trump – Jolley calls these conspiracies “very politically motivated”. Yet while some high-profile right-wing figureheads were undoubtedly cynical in leveraging their accusations, this doesn’t mean ordinary people don’t truly believe what they read. “It can speak to feelings of paranoia, and our desire to feel that other groups are out to get us,” Jolley says, explaining that confirmation bias means we accept evidence that supports our pre-existing believes and dismiss that which doesn’t (such as, for example, multiple pictures of Donald Trump socialising with Epstein).",0
1451745461623083009,Chrissy Teigen is a satanic pedophile.,"Like most conspiracy theorists, QAnon supporters look for patterns and proof – in this case, by combing through Teigen’s old tweets. On 16 July, the model seemed to accept no amount of blocking could stop the conspiracists: “Let them pretend to be doing something. We all need purpose,” she wrote. Jolley concurs that conspiracies can be rewarding for believers: “Looking for the ‘truth’ can offer purpose.” Jennifer says her mother was “looking for a fantasy world” where all of society’s problems would be fixed and she found this with QAnon. She also points to her mother’s poor internet literacy as a factor in her beliefs. “She’d show me a picture of Obama with a very young girl sat between his legs,” Jennifer says, explaining the image was clearly Photoshopped. “She doesn’t understand technology.” Dr Lee Hadlington is a cyberpsychology lecturer at Nottingham Trent University who is currently studying how fake news spreads. He compares misinformation to a virus – “it only needs a small germ of interest to grab hold” – and explains how obvious Photoshops can gain traction. “They may look fake to us, but for others that have a vested interest in things like this and a different world view, they appear realistic representations of what might have happened,” he says, noting that confirmation bias once again comes into play. He also adds that “bandwagon heuristics” increase the likeliness that people will share an image or post – put simply, “we are more likely to believe, like and share something that has lots of existing likes and shares.”",0
1451745461623083009,Chrissy Teigen is a satanic pedophile.,"Of course, this phenomenon isn’t totally new. In the 1980s, the Satanic Panic took over the United States – a number of childcare centres were falsely accused of child abuse and satanic ritual abuse. Hadlington notes, however, that the internet allows misinformation to spread globally in a matter of hours without the need for published materials or time-consuming translations. One question remains: why is Teigen, in particular, so hounded? She was first accused of paedophilia by a popular right-wing conspiracy theorist in 2017, and responded on Twitter almost immediately. Teigen has repeatedly used the social network to deny and mock QAnon posts – the attention she gains seems partially related to the fact she fights back. While Tom Hanks falls victim to similar abuse, he has not yet spoken out about it. The same is true for numerous other celebrities accused by QAnon – from Lady Gaga to Demi Moore to Jim Carrey. Like many people whose family members have become QAnon conspiracists, Jennifer isn’t hopeful about the future. “Every argument you have, they have ten other comebacks for it, and it’s exhausting and frustrating,” she says. “Unfortunately, I don’t see her letting go of it.

When all these celebrities get up on their high horse about Trump they don’t get it that it makes our whole country look bad when they are posting stuff on social media.

My thing is this…if you want to be seen as more than just a “celebrity” and you dabbled into politics or other areas (that is out of your scope or competence) then you should be prepared for the consequences or reaction.

I was eating ALL DAY, while doing absolutely nothing physical. I ate 8 meals a day. After one week, the bowel movements started slowing down. As a result - the undigestible lump in my gut kept growing and become totally uncomfortable. By two months, my breathing got restricted, as I gained 57 pounds. I had to start buying new, larger pants and shirts. Tying my shoes also required holding my breath, until I realized slip-ons are the way to go. When showering, I always needed a crutch… a long body brush. I started retaining lots of water. The bloat was painful, almost like inflammatory swelling. My cheeks puffed-out and I had no neck. I was sleepy, all day long. What did I do? I took long naps after eating. The fat just piled on. My metabolism was now in full, fat storage mode. The constant yawning was unbearable. I kept eating like food was suddenly going extinct.",0

I consulted a Bodybuilder on how to lose the weight. Under his tutelage - I lost 32 pounds in 30 days. Because I refused to lift weights, the sagging flaps of loose skin looked worse than the fat itself. I gained it all back again. This time, over the next 3 years I slowly lost all the weight, by adding high repetitions, light weights, extreme portion control, cardio on an empty stomach and eliminating all sugar and soda. I let my skin’s natural elasticity shrink in proportion to slower weight loss. The result is much more favorable. My waist is now 31 inches, with visible six pack abs I have not seen since High School! I finally got my neck back, along with the chiseled facial features I truly missed.

She is making millions now, yet she can't keep her street slang and strip club lingo out of her mouth. I am not sensitive to foul language, it's just sort of annoying to constantly hear it every time she's trying to tell a story. Also, I stopped following her because just as Nicki Minaj knows Cardi is being used — I know it and see it as well.

It's okay to be any one of these types but it doesn't mean that you have the right to say that an artiste doesn't deserve the fame they acquired through their hard work just because you don't enjoy her music. Even if you don't like the music she makes, her fame speaks for her and a lot of people like her music.

1451674009326669825,Beyonce is a satanic witch,"As one of the most successful and talented women in the world, it was only a matter of time before Beyoncé Knowles started to attract claims that she had achieved her greatness through dark arts. Most recently, a former drummer for the musician made an unsuccessful request for a restraining order against Beyoncé, claiming that she used “extreme witchcraft, dark magic” and “magic spells of sexual molestation” against session musician Kimberly Thompson - as well as allegedly killing her kitten. A judge refused to approve Thompson’s request for a restraining order, but she isn’t the first – and won’t be the last – to accuse Beyoncé of being a witch. Along with her husband, rapper Jay Z, the pop star has attracted all manner of conspiracy theories during her ascent to fame, some of which she’s even addressed in her art. Here are some of the most bizzare: Beyoncé is part of the Illuminati Arguably the best-established Beyoncé conspiracy theory: that she, along with Jay Z, are members of the secret society. Although the Illuminati was originally founded by Bavarians in the late-18th century to oppose the Catholic Church, these days Christian fundamentalists tend to believe that it is stuffed full of prominent figures keen to usher in the Antichrist.",0

From Telephone to Sweet Dreams, Beyoncé’s videos have been endlessly deconstructed by YouTube theorists to point out her demon-worshipping. It’s thought that if you play Single Ladies backwards, it will tell you to bow down to Satan. Beyoncé finally denied the notion in her 2016 single Lemonade: “Y'all haters corny with that Illuminati mess”. But she and Jay Z have, some think, begun baited the theorists with Illuminati symbolism in the work. Setting the video for Apes---, the lead single off their 2018 joint album, Everything Is Love, in the Louvre was particularly incendiary: the Parisian gallery, with its pyramidal form and supposed 666 glass panels, is thought to be a favourite Illuminati venue.

1451674009326669825,Beyonce is a satanic witch,"There’s a fair amount to take in here. Namely Blue Ivy. Conspiracists suggested that she wasn’t Beyoncé’s child, but the illegitimate daughter of Jay Z and another woman. More bonkers theories thought the baby was actually fathered by Beyoncé’s father and ex-manager, Matthew Knowles. Why the doubting of the pregnancy? Beyoncé is famously impeccable - and controlling - about the presentation of her image, and, given the news was about the contents of her womb, said “it was important to me that I was able to [unveil her pregnancy] myself”. She did so during the VMA awards, both on the red carpet and then, famously, while performing during the ceremony.

1451674009326669825,Beyonce is a satanic witch,"Beyoncé is seven years older than she claims Hardly the rarest claim in showbusiness, but a conspiracy theory nonetheless. Beyoncé’s birth date is officially listed as September 4, 1981, making her 37 years old. But there’s a belief that she was actually born on September 4, 1974 - making her, at the time of writing, 44. Why? In 2006 someone who claimed to work for the Texas Department of Heath allegedly found her birth record. Plus there’s the fact few photos exist of an adolescent awkward phase, and the fact that her father once said in an interview that Pink, born in 1979 and Usher, born in 1978, was “the exact same as Beyonce”. But as conspiracy theories go, this one doesn’t really stand up. The theory gets more twisty for those who believe the older Beyoncé gave birth to her sister, Solange. (Presumably these theorists are not the same ones who also believe her incapable of spawing Blue Ivy). According to the conspiracy, Beyoncé was 15 when Solange was born, but that doesn’t quite add up in this photograph of them as children:",0

Beyoncé died in 2000 and has since been replaced by a clone Arguably one of the less readily subscribed to theories, but one that exists nonetheless. Little explanation is given for how, or indeed specifically when, Beyoncé died in 2000, only that canny producers decided to get hold of her stem cells and secretly perfect human cloning so that the money-making Beyoncé machine could continue after her death.

When something about a woman’s way just seem too threatening or independent, well, her contemporaries throughout history have decided, “Perhaps she’s a witch?” So, while we no longer burn anyone at the stake for witchcraft (so far as we’re aware of), perhaps it’s not too surprising that rumors of witchcraft still linger around powerful women even today.

The Fleetwood Mac singer, however, didn’t take too kindly to the suggestion. “In the beginning of my career, the whole idea that some wacky, creepy people were writing, ‘You’re a witch, you’re a witch!’ was so arresting,” she once told the L.A. Times. “And there I am like, ‘No, I’m not! I just wear black because it makes me look thinner, you idiots.’” Sometimes, a woman just likes black clothing. Though, after decades of clarifying that she does not and never had practiced any sort of black magic, Nicks finally leaned into the rumor by appearing as herself on American Horror Story: Coven in 2013.",0

Indeed, many blamed Nurmi’s supposed witchcraft for the untimely death of James Dean. In 1954, Nurmi began hosting midnight showings of horror movies on Los Angeles local channel KABC as the subversive Vampira, becoming the first “horror host” in America (indeed, the Elvira character was patterned after Vampira). A pre-fame Dean became a fan and friend, and even briefly appeared on her program. There may very well have been some kind of a relationship, but Dean publicly asserted they never dated, supposedly telling gossip columnist Hedda Hopper that he doesn’t date “cartoons” or “witches,” depending on the version you happen to hear. When Dean died in a car crash, in 1955, the seedier tabloids of the day ran stories claiming that Nurmi had hexed him out of her supposed unrequited love and caused the crash (though some claim that Nurmi had actually built an altar for Dean months before his death, in an attempt to keep him safe). Shortly after the rumors spread in 1956, Nurmi crashed a Halloween party full of Hollywood heavyweights dressed as a witch and with a man dressed as a bandaged and battered Dean.",0
1451674009326669825,Beyonce is a satanic witch,"Earlier this year, Kimberly Thompson, who performed drums in Beyoncé’s backup band for seven years, filed a bizarre request for a restraining order, accusing the singer of practicing vindictive witchcraft. (Obtained by gossip Web site The Blast](https://theblast.com/beyonce-restraining-order-former-drummer-witchcraft-dark-magic/), the filing claimed Bey dabbled in “extreme witchcraft, dark magic” and cast “magic spells of sexual molestation.” A judge, of course, quickly turned down Thompson’s request for the order. Yet folks on the Internet began dabbling in their own dark social media magic, diving into the possibility that Beyoncé did actually practice the dark arts. Those theories ultimately dovetailed with longstanding conspiracy theories that Beyoncé and husband Jay-Z are high-standing members of the Illuminati. Beyoncé never publicly responded to Thompson’s claims, but perhaps she said it best on her song “Formation” when she rapped, “Y’all haters corny with that illuminati mess.”",0

Back in 2011, Spanish-language media ran with some suspicious Santeria accusations stemming from a woman who was dating Lopez’s first husband, Ojani Noa, at the time. “I’ve been told she does the worse—frightening stuff! Jennifer has a godmother in Miami, which I’ve never met, but Ojani knows her, and she calls this woman to tell her, ‘Do this to this person, put up a black candle, etc.’ She’s done amarres [spells] on all her boyfriends,” said the woman. “It’s a typical thing for anybody involved in Santeria.

She’s not a witch. She just supports small business. The actress did happen to own an occult shop at some point, but it wasn’t because she was a previous customer. “The true story is I found this occult shop in L.A., and I used to go there to ask them questions and do my research,” Balk told Entertainment Weekly last year. “They were really lovely people.

1451674009326669825,Beyonce is a satanic witch,"Ryan McGinley has a childhood memory in which he’s sitting alongside his seven brothers and sisters during mass, listening to the priest preach about sin. “I grew up very religious, very Roman Catholic,” says the American photographer whose portraits of naked misfits made him an icon to the Vice generation. “I was taught to believe in sin and Satan, and it scared the shit out of me.”",0
1451674009326669825,Beyonce is a satanic witch,"It might not seem to square with his reputation, but faith has played a huge part in McGinley’s work. He was taught religious art at school in New Jersey and remembers staring at The Creation of Adam, Michelangelo’s depiction of God giving life to the first man, in the Vatican’s Sistine Chapel.",0
1451674009326669825,Beyonce is a satanic witch,"“It was probably the first piece of art that spoke to me,” he says today. “The almost-touching fingers. Adam nude. That was the first glimpse of a naked man’s body. I still remember the impact it had on me.”",0
1451674009326669825,Beyonce is a satanic witch,"Michelangelo’s worship of the human body is reflected in McGinley’s searing portraits of the “like-minded weirdos” he has met over two decades of life in Manhattan, which comprise the exhibition Pretty Free – originally due to be on show at London’s Marlborough Gallery this month, but now accessible online.",0
1451674009326669825,Beyonce is a satanic witch,"“The human body is beautiful. It was created by Mother Earth, our goddess. But posing nude is still an act of rebellion,” McGinley says. “Even Michelangelo had trouble with nudity. Many people thought his fresco was outrageous, more suitable for a public bath or a tavern than a Catholic chapel.”",0
1451674009326669825,Beyonce is a satanic witch,"McGinley’s ability to reveal who we are through our bodies comes from deeply internal experiences. McGinley was the youngest by seven years. He grew up in a crowded house in Ramsey, a middle class suburb of New Jersey, the son of a Korean war veteran who worked as a traveling salesman for Owens Corning, a roof insulation company.",0
1451674009326669825,Beyonce is a satanic witch,"He remembers silently watching his teenage brothers and sisters in awe. But, by the time he was 10, each of his siblings had grown up and moved out, leaving him “feeling like an only child”. Then, as he hit teenagehood, his older brother Michael, a student at School of Visual Arts NYC, suddenly moved home.",0
1451674009326669825,Beyonce is a satanic witch,"While it wasn’t talked of, Michael lived in New York with his boyfriend, Richard, a Barbara Streisand impersonator. He was McGinley’s first introduction to art; to the downtown stars of Keith Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat and the old New York doyens Jackson Pollock and Mark Rothko.",0
1451674009326669825,Beyonce is a satanic witch,"“He taught me a lot about creativity,” McGinley remembers. “How to do theatrical makeup; he would put a witch’s nose on me and then blend it in with makeup. He did my colour chart and showed me what colour of clothing looked best on me. Michael turned me on to oil sticks and watercolours. He taught me choreography and how to be performative. He was 17 years older than me, and he had a huge impact on the way I see the world.”",0
1451674009326669825,Beyonce is a satanic witch,"Michael had Aids, an illness his family, and America at large, did not fully understand. McGinley spent much of his teenage years nursing his brother before heading out to skateboard and spray graffiti to the sound of Wu-Tang Clan and Ramones.",0
1451674009326669825,Beyonce is a satanic witch,"For all his carefree bravado among his friends, it was a stressful time; McGinley has spoken of his family having to secure his brother’s bedroom door with a chair so he couldn’t reach a kitchen knife, of once calling for an ambulance in a panic when he found his brother in a near-coma after swallowing all his medication.",0
1451674009326669825,Beyonce is a satanic witch,He remembers wheeling his brother in a chair through the Ramsey neighbourhood and concocting to their neighbours a story about Michael having cancer. The family feared what the community would do if they knew the truth.,0
1451674009326669825,Beyonce is a satanic witch,"“Aids was considered a gay disease,” McGinley says. “And there really weren’t many gay people in the suburbs on New Jersey. When my brother came home sick, people were scared. When he got Kaposi’s sarcoma – spots all over his face and body – we tried to hide them with L’Oreal make-up. It sounds so sad now. But at the time we were just trying to protect him so he could live with us in peace. We did the best we could with what we had.”",0
1451674009326669825,Beyonce is a satanic witch,"Michael died a few months after McGinley’s 17th birthday. “He passed away from Aids at the same time I knew I was also gay. That created some complicated emotions. The only gay men I knew growing up were my brother and his group of friends. They all contracted the disease and died one by one. So, in my teenage mind, I associated being sick and dying with my sexuality. I developed a very masculine personality at the time to unconsciously combat my queer impulses.”",0
1451674009326669825,Beyonce is a satanic witch,"In 1997, at the age of 19, McGinley enrolled as an art student at New York’s Parsons School of Design and moved to Bleecker Street in Greenwich Village. “My first room-mate was a female dominatrix,” McGinley says. “She realised I was gay and helped me come out. She was my guardian angel.”",0
1451674009326669825,Beyonce is a satanic witch,"From there, McGinley “unleashed”. He paid his way through school by selling weed and spent every evening exploring the illicit riches of the East Village.",0
1451674009326669825,Beyonce is a satanic witch,"“Honestly, it was really the golden period of gay bars,” he says. He remembers, in one long monologue that doubles as a glorious tribute to old New York, a night walking down Avenue A. “You could start at Nowhere Bar on 14th Street and catch a glimpse of Stephin Merritt from the Magnetic Fields,” he says. “13th Street had The Phoenix, where we’d play pool. David LaChapelle’s studio was a few doors down. The Cock on 12th Street was the most wild; it’s where everyone bought their drugs.",0
1451674009326669825,Beyonce is a satanic witch,"“The Pyramid was on Seventh Street; they had the legendary drag shows. Sixth street had I.C.Guys, the smallest gay bar in Manhattan; they held poetry readings with Eileen Myles and parties for Bruce LaBruce. Sixth had Eastern Block, too, that’s where the best DJs would play. There would always be a party at Mistress Formika, which was under a sushi restaurant on Fifth Street, and Fourth Street had The Boiler Room, which is where all the cute NYU college students were. Then on Tuesday nights there was the Beige party at the Bowery Bar on Fourth Street and Bowery; that’s where all the gay models and celebrities would hang out in the courtyard.”",0
1451674009326669825,Beyonce is a satanic witch,"“I would do the entire bar crawl with my Yashica T4 and shoot 10 rolls a night,” continues McGinley, before adding wistfully: “All those places are gone now.”",0
1451674009326669825,Beyonce is a satanic witch,"McGinley lived that way – “as a fly on the wall” – for the best part of five years. “I saw myself as part of a tradition,” McGinley says. “Following in the footsteps of Allen Ginsberg, Andy Warhol and Nan Goldin, shooting my tribe in Brooklyn and Manhattan.”",0
1451674009326669825,Beyonce is a satanic witch,"His earliest pictures, shot on his Yashica and a Polaroid, are soaked in a kind of wild euphoria. They are often rough and physical; pictures of semen, urine and blood, of a girl’s face covered in cocaine or a boy’s covered in bruises. But the images are often quiet and tender too; McGinley’s first boyfriend asleep, or the two of them smiling and kissing in bed, or Ryan photographing himself as he cried.",0
1451674009326669825,Beyonce is a satanic witch,"McGinley printed and self-published an edit of his Polaroids in a book titled The Kids Were Alright, and, after a DIY exhibition in a vacant building on West Broadway, managed to get the book passed into the hands of Sylvia Wolf, the then director of photographs at Whitney Museum of American Art. In 2003, just after McGinley’s 25th birthday, Wolf curated an exhibition of McGinley’s portraits at the Whitney, making him the youngest artist in 30 years to be granted a solo show at one of New York’s most venerable art institutions.",0
1451674009326669825,Beyonce is a satanic witch,"Well-paying gigs for brands like Levi and Marc Jacobs duly followed. Then came magazine commissions to shoot Beyoncé and Brad Pitt. McGinley, who had never boarded a flight before, was suddenly travelling the world. He was soon able to set up a studio next to a bridal shop in Chinatown; it’s still spoken of as a modern-day Warholian factory for Insta-famous artists like Petra Collins and Sandy Kim. His style was widely replicated by photographers from an increasingly globalised scene, most notably the late Chinese photographer Ren Hang and Thai artist Ohm Phanphiroj.",0
1451674009326669825,Beyonce is a satanic witch,"Many artists respond to recognition by offering up more of the same. McGinley saw his ascent as an opportunity to change. “I was born a child of the woods,” he says. “And so my work became more about travelling and using nature as a backdrop.” McGinley began to organise summer road trips into the American wilderness. If his early vistas were dank apartments, subterranean bars and Escher-like rooftops, McGinley now photographs his naked ingenue as they scale trees, lie in secluded lakes or dance in the depths of hidden caves.",0
1451674009326669825,Beyonce is a satanic witch,"McGinley’s recent imagery, exhibited for the first time at the Marlborough show, is his most compositional work yet, orientating his youthful bodies in the flood of colour and light that nature provides in full bloom. “For the first 10 years, my road trips were exclusively in the summer,” he says. “Now we have started to shoot in the fall and winter. The colour palette of each season drastically changes the photograph.”",0
1451674009326669825,Beyonce is a satanic witch,"McGinley is now a celebrity in the East Village. Yet he still attends church in New Jersey. He drives over the Hudson to his childhood home, picks up his mum and sits next to her in the pews.",0
1451674009326669825,Beyonce is a satanic witch,"“I love to hear her sing,” he says. “I still think churches are the most beautiful buildings in the world; the high ceilings, the stained glass, the way the light beams through it.”",0
1451674009326669825,Beyonce is a satanic witch,"He still has faith. But, these days, he doesn’t worry so much about Satan. “I just follow a simple mantra,” he says. “Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.”",0
1451674009326669825,Beyonce is a satanic witch,"The ""one-eye"" is a symbol of the Illuminati and it represents the “all seeing eye"", which is representative of intelligence, wisdom and enlightenment in a worldly, secular or non-Christian understanding of the world. It also is suggestive that the “all seeing eye” see's all and is always watching everyone. It is essentially a symbol of the Illuminati, who practices Luciferian doctrine and worships Satan.",0
1451674009326669825,Beyonce is a satanic witch,"The Illuminati runs and controls most of the music industry and many of the most popular artists in the world and whether they know it or not, are apart of the Illuminati and are crafted and ghost- written by some of the most worldly and secular minds the Illuminati has to offer. These artists are contracted and in return for fame and fortune beyond normal successes are pursuaded and cohersed, unknowingly or knowingly to sing certain messages in their songs as well as sell their souls to the devil for their fame and fortune to be continued to be enabled, supported and allowed to happen. This is not at all a figure of speech, but these artists are literally required to ""sell their souls"" to the devil in exchange for promoting their ideals amd agenda through music crafted (both vocals and instrumentals) to spiritually influence the minds of people in the world.",0
1451674009326669825,Beyonce is a satanic witch,"If you listen closely to the messages in the music created by these artists, you will hear them engaging and referring to such ideals as the promotion of self interests and indulgences, second personna's or even overt representations and symbolism of the Illuminati and self worship, all of which based on Christian doctrine will lead you directly to Hell. These techniques and the imagery of the “one eye” symbolism are evidence of what the artists represent and are willing to represent publically as a means of conveying their support of the Illuminati and their agenda. Technically, an artist cannot just blindly sell their soul to Satan but have to knowingly and literally sign the contract in their own blood…as a practice artists often publically joke about on talk shows and interviews. For those artists who do not believe in God or Satan and agree to do whatever they are asked to do as apart of their career just to get the fame and fortune, it's all the easier to convince them to “sign their souls” over to Satan, since the artist does not believe in either God or Satan and find signing a contract “in their own blood” to be a cute and entertaining gimmick.",0
1451674009326669825,Beyonce is a satanic witch,"In many numerous music videos, if you pay close attention, you will see the promotion of ""one eye"", the pyramid or diamond, finger gestures like extending your index and pinky and folding in the rest of your fingers (a traditional and common rock music gesture) or even pictures of baphomet… The half man, half goat icon image that represents Satan. YouTube has a large collection of videos where this imagery is practiced and openly displayed, slowed down and stopped on genuine examples of these practices.",0
1451674009326669825,Beyonce is a satanic witch,"One example would be Wiz Khalifa's song, “Black and Yellow”. In the song, there is a quick scene where a kid wearing a shirt with baphomet on it jumps up and into the camera frame, with another child in the foreground looking directly into the camera throwing the finger gesture for baphomet, all while Wiz Khalifa ironically is throwing up his hands up with what appears to be a gesture of worship. The imagery is disturbing to say the least. Sometimes, you can also play back some music in reverse, discovering and hearing forward played messages also known as ""backplay"", containing secular or Lucifer worshipping or coded messaging. One example would be from Jay-Z, where he has a song produced by DJ Danger Mouse that is a remake of Jay-Z's song ""Lucifer"". where Jay-Z himself says things like ""Murder Jesus"", ""Catholics... I got to murder them"", and ""666"". The album that DJ Danger Mouse produced using remakes using instrumentals from The Beatles was ultimately praised by Jay-Z himself. Another example would be a song by Beyonce called ""Crazy in Love"" and has some filthy messages I can't even repeat in this post. These are just a few examples and the list of goes on and on with many artists in the industry. The Illuminati is essentially primarily pop, rap, hip hop, rock and alternative genres as their primary outlet for their aggressive works, promoting the doctrine of Lucifer or Satan. Check out YouTube for fully documented examples of these things and listen for yourselves.",0
1451674009326669825,Beyonce is a satanic witch,"This is NOT a joke… These practices are very real and I invite you all to learn exactly who the Illuminati is... they are an organization that practices and engages in Luciferian doctrine, control of the masses and the minds of and in this world and they have an end goal which many others people shown through YouTube, blogs and many other outlets can elaborate on for you.",0

1451674009326669825,Beyonce is a satanic witch,"You really should not waste energy or time talking or thinking about such things. I nearly lost my soul and my mind by researching this kind of esoteric “knowledge”. I believe there is a category of knowledge that can create destructive forces within the mind, leading to mental illness like psychosis. It happened to me 4 years ago, and also to someone else I know a few months earlier. We were researching the same crap. With that mental illness you often lose the greater part of your emotions - your soul. I know, it can feel rewarding to make new connections of interesting ideas, but this process in overdrive can lead to paranoia and delusional thinking. Surely some part of you knows that this quest for more (useless) knowledge is a self destructive desire. As is the desire to share this knowledge with others (eg Bill Daly’s answer). Try to enjoy life without analysing it to death.",0
1451674009326669825,Beyonce is a satanic witch,"If these conspiracies concern you, then maybe use this as motivation to find or create new social circles and communities that are free of these influences. Stop exposing yourself to art that is disturbing, depressing or cryptic. Stop chasing conspiracy theories that were probably invented by other insane delusional people. Let it go, no matter how enticing the desire for more esoteric knowledge may be. And move on with your life. Do something constructive and fulfilling, something pure and untouched by evil. Create your own art or projects, make them beautiful, original, and most importantly, noble. Avoid reusing other people’s symbolism - if you must use symbols, create your own, from a place of love.

Oh hear Him, Christian within me. 
It stirs my sin; the river, 
Oh, she swells with our lousiness. 
All my life will end for him? 
We're all out of signs, 
I know I'm sorta shocked 
To hear The Lord, 
My God now will save me! 
Oh I will n'er be saved, 
Because I live with Satan.. 
One wish today; 
That you'll all pray for 
Three who will make it here late. 
Pray now and you'll see.. 
The 'Lord' turned me on, 
But, oh, I was the shaggy fool.. 
Clothed in agony, 
Lost at a height. 
There's no escaping it, 
Nor his woes.. 
So here's to my Sweet Satan. 
The other's little path 
Would make me sad, 
Whose power is faith. 
He'll give those with him 666. 
And all the evil fools, 
they know he made 
us suffer sadly.

They're offered me.""

1451674009326669825,Beyonce is a satanic witch,"Robert Plant says that he wrote the words to Stairway to Heaven in an afternoon.  In true rock star fashion, he shrugs his shoulders and says I don’t know when asked what the song is about.  He must be kidding.  Us kids in middle school knew what the song was about: it was about making a choice and bargaining your soul: choosing wine, women and song over study hall, Latin II, and Computer Science; walking in the cloven-hove-ed path of Pan instead of the dusty sandals of Jesus; it was about trading your immortal soul for a good time.   “Yes there are two paths you can go by…  The Piper's calling you to join him...  Spring clean for the May Queen…  As we wind on down the road/Our shadows taller than our soul/There walks a lady we all know/Who shines white light and wants to show/How everything still turns to gold/And if you listen very hard/The truth will come to you at last/When all are one and one is all/To be a rock and not to roll/And she’s buying a Stairway to Heaven…”  It’s not even so much in the lyrics though.  Listen to the song again and hear how it starts as a medieval ballad, it’s Scarborough Fair, or “What Is A Youth” from Zeffirelli’s genius 1968 version of Romeo and Juliet, and then Stairway to Heaven becomes a rock jam that will bury Iron Man.  Every Middle School dance that I ever attended ended with either Stairway to Heaven or Freebird.  Both songs represented the apex, a place from which there is nowhere to go but home.  Both songs also presented the same problem – you start out in a slow dance/hug, groping the lower back or bra strap of your date, then when the song goes from slow to fast, some that are truly in love slow-dance through the fast part in a sweaty embrace, others break their hold and begin to rock out.  Herein lies the rub.  I remember leaning far forward, “bent double like beggars under sacks” to hide my affection.  As I watch my 16 year old dog drop pieces of coal from beneath her tail when she doesn’t even know it, it’s hard for me not to think that incontinence is to old age what the accidental erection is to youth.  While our bodies used to have spontaneous demonstrations of the life creating power within us, later they have only spontaneous demonstrations of our accumulated detritus that longs to get out and lay upon the floor in peaceful repose.",0
1451674009326669825,Beyonce is a satanic witch,"Freebird and Stairway to Heaven, the two most powerful songs of my youth, meant such different things.  Freebird is, like the title, a song about being free, unencumbered by the tethers of a relationship. Stairway to Heaven is so much more; it’s like the Book of Genesis to an entire generation.",0
1451674009326669825,Beyonce is a satanic witch,"Contrary to what the Creationists believe, the Book of Genesis does not present a scientific theory of any kind.  It should not be taught in any class dedicated to science, but in every class dedicated to Religious Studies.  The Book of Genesis was created when two Jewish creation traditions, the Elohist and the Yahwist were combined.  If you read carefully God creates humans twice.  First in the “let there be light” scenario that happens in six days and a day of rest. God says, “We created them in Our image.”  Whoops!  How can this be?  Is God misquoted?  Doesn’t He mean, “I created him in My image?”  No, it’s no accident or translation mistake.  This We/Our probably refers to Wisdom, the female counterpart to the male God in the Elohist tradition, and yes, Man and Woman are created simultaneously, one is not before the other.  Genesis has a second creation of mankind when Yahweh leans over and breathes the Breath of Life into a lump of clay to create Adam (Yahwist).  One God is unseen and all-powerful – the Elohist.  The other God is anthropomorphized – breathes, walks and talks – the Yahwist.  This is not my theory.  This is as close to universally recognized as anything can be in Biblical Studies.  What does this have to do with Stairway to Heaven?  Everything!  The Yahwist story tells of Adam and Eve and God walking together in the Garden of Eden and it tells the story that some theologians have termed “Original Sin.”  If you’ve studied Catholic theology (and I know you haven’t) you know that Original Sin is what made redemption of the human race by Jesus on the cross necessary.  The doctrine of Original Sin, in a terrifying ramification, makes every baby destined for Hell unless saved by Jesus Christ.  This is why Christians baptize infants.  Now when I take liberties with the song Stairway to Heaven and say that it doesn’t really matter what Robert Plant meant or says I do not do so without precedent.  That is exactly the same thing that the Christians did with the Jewish stories of creation.  Christians interpreted the Yahwist creation story that involves eating the fruit of the tree of knowledge good/bad and Adam and Eve’s subsequent expulsion from the Garden of Eden as the first chapter in the doctrine of Original Sin.  The Jews anticipated a Messiah to be a unifying king, not a Christ to be savior.",0
1451674009326669825,Beyonce is a satanic witch,"According to the doctrine of Original Sin, if we are all children of Adam and Eve, then we are all children of the fallen – hence Heavy Metal music.  The thing that I have always admired about Heavy Metal music is it's deep sense of morality -- it recognizes that rockers are sinners and destined for Hell and embraces it.  Today rappers sing about killing without any fear of cosmic retribution.  If they get caught they do time, still rapping and remaining entirely recalcitrant from their jail cell.  When we were partying and screwing we knew we were going to pay for it, not in a jail cell but in Hell.  It made sense.  If Adam and Eve can earn damnation for themselves and all of their children by disobeying God’s orders, then the rest of us can certainly damn our own souls by doing the same.",0
1451674009326669825,Beyonce is a satanic witch,"If God walked hand in hand with us as he does in the Garden and made it that simple a lot of us would do a lot better at obeying God’s commands.  Unfortunately, according to the tradition, God has been in absentia, or at least invisible for most of the past four thousand years.  To further complicate things the Serpent is still here.  The Serpent says as he did to Eve, “Hey this guy God is not who He says He is.  The fruit from that tree won’t hurt you.  It will make you wise like God.  That’s why God doesn’t want you to have it.” Throughout the Bible the serpent is a symbol of wisdom.  Jesus himself says it to his disciples, (Matthew 10:16) “Be wise as serpents and gentle as doves.”",0
1451674009326669825,Beyonce is a satanic witch,"It is desire for knowledge that tempts Adam and Eve into the fall.  And the church and religion have had a problem with wisdom ever since.  This is why over the years they have excommunicated scores of scientists, most famously Galileo.  If we had listened to the church we would have no technology.  We would all be washing our clothes down by the river with stones and dying in droves from cholera and plague.  The Renaissance changed all that.

What the IPC doesn’t realize is that Nordic whites, Celtic whites and Anglo whites were first.  These new victims are only the latest culture to be sucked up into the giant rolling snowball of Western Culture.  Before the Roman’s arrived on the British Isles, the pagan and Norse gods were doing great.  Some scholars say that the Lord of the Rings books are all about the invasion and subjugation of the Nordic people to the Romans - the destruction of the very democratic system of small Chieftains in favor of a central god-like emperor that demands tithe from even the most far flung Roman outpost.",0
1451674009326669825,Beyonce is a satanic witch,"So… back to Robert Plant, back to Led Zeppelin – when the Romans took over the islands of his forefathers and brought first, emperor worship, then later Christianity, the gods of his people were forced to go underground – those who practiced these beliefs became known as pagans, witches, masters of the black arts.  They were banned, feared and persecuted by Roman troops.  Does this sound familiar?  It sounds to me a lot like the voodoo and magic practiced in the Caribbean, Latin America, Southeast Asia, etc. any place where poor people have been subjected to outside rule.",0
1451674009326669825,Beyonce is a satanic witch,"For those who feel oppressed, for those without recourse to justice or economic advancement, magic, angry gods, curses, an end to all life on earth, these are the weapons of choice.  I’m not agreeing with Marx here and saying that Religion is the Opiate of the Masses.  In fact I think he was exactly wrong.  Religion is the revenge of the masses albeit delayed at best or imaginary at worst.  Poor people like rich people more when they know the rich will soon roast on Satan’s spit.  Poor people feel empowered by ritual and frankly the wealthy are intimidated. This is common.  Look at the apocalyptic religion of Christianity.  There is a direct correlation between the economic welfare of believers and the timing of the apocalypse.  If you go to a Methodist church in a wealthy neighborhood the coming of the apocalypse is marked in centuries.  If you had a time machine and were able to attend a black Pentecostal church in the 1950s, the apocalypse was coming in a matter of days or weeks.  If your time machine was really good you could go back to 53AD and look at Paul of Tarsus.  In his letters he told those that were married to stay married and those that were not married to stay that way too because the apocalypse was coming any second now.  As things have gotten better for blacks in the United States, even the black Pentecostal church now doesn’t see an immediate apocalypse.  For those who are suffering, the apocalypse cannot come soon enough.",0
1451674009326669825,Beyonce is a satanic witch,"So, what does this have to do with being a teenager and slow dancing to Stairway to Heaven?  Teenagers feel oppressed.  They think they know what is good for them but they are ruled by outside forces.  In America, in the 70s, the Judeo Christian tradition was universally the tradition of the parents.  The parents said no.  Robert Plant said yes.  But even Robert Plant knew there is always a price to pay.  Robert Johnson traded his immortal soul for an unworldly ability on the guitar.  The Devil asks, What do you want? And, What are you willing to give up?",0
1451674009326669825,Beyonce is a satanic witch,"Adam and Eve wanted knowledge from the tree Good/Bad and they traded immortality, an easy life, innocence and face time with God to get it.  After the fall they realized that they were naked, that women will have great pain in child birth, and that men will break their backs to get food out of the ground – all because they wanted wisdom, wisdom like the serpent had, wisdom like God had.  Some scholars have interpreted this story, the Yahwist story of Creation, as not a fall from grace for all of humankind but a story about adolescence.  When a child hits puberty, suddenly they realize they are naked.  They have shame and hide aspects of their lives from their parents (God).  These new women will experience many varieties of pain if they become pregnant and the newly minted men will soon be delivering pizzas for pocket change.  They will look for and find faults in their parents – the snake was right, this God guy is not who He says He is.  And after they break the covenant they will feel a separation.  It’s inevitable.",0

The old Jews were great.  They created images that last, the Garden of Eden, the Breath of Life, The Serpent.  But no one holds a candle to Shakespeare: He is my proof that we are not just monkeys with iPods.  The scene below, once again from the genius of Zeffirelli, is Shakespeare’s take on Original Sin.  When I was a child I remember my favorite babysitter/surrogate sister burst into tears while we watched this scene.  I asked her, “Why do you cry?”

It doesn’t just make me think of the deaths of Romeo and Juliet but of everything melancholy: the deaths of my mother and grandmothers, the fact that (God willing) my daughters will be old ladies some day and I will be long gone.  I find it so grave because it holds in its gentle grasp exactly what it is to be alive.  This excited gamble, this wager, perhaps this is what it means to be an adolescent; life is so abundant yet death is always near, the death of innocence, the literal death for some through adolescent rebellion, the separation, the hurry, the hurry into the dusty drudgery of adulthood.",0
1451674009326669825,Beyonce is a satanic witch,The zeitgeist of Led Zeppelin is undeniable.  They spoke to a generation that was abandoning the Church of their parents and was enduring the adolescent ejection from the Garden of Eden at the same time.  Just outside the gate Pan stood in the brambles with a wine sack and a lute.  Women laughed in the distant forest.  What do you want?  What are you willing to give up?  The two questions of adulthood.  Two questions that still haunt me when I hear Stairway to Heaven.  It’s in the music; this is forever; there could be a Hell; there could be a Heaven; my soul may be eternal.  What do I want?  What am I willing to give up?,0

1451674009326669825,Beyonce is a satanic witch,"Led Zeppelin has always been one of those bands with some kind of mystery surrounding them. Most of the Rock and Roll fans can agree unanimously about the greatness of the song 'Stairway to heaven'.But the point is...look at Led Zep members, their attire,their accent,Page's guitar solos, and even the intro of their songs; everything seems mysterious about them.And if you even read the original lyrics of the song 'Stairway to heaven', its quite perplexing with different interpretations. As for the backward masking, its not just the case of  'our mind hears what it wants to hear'. The mention of Satan is quite clear. The reference to satanic number 666 is quite clear too.And I challenge anyone to come up with different logical backward interpretation of the line ""If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now...""
I am not a devil worshipper neither I am a believer. But I do believe that Led Zep members obviously have something to do with all this. Look at the history of Rock/Metal.Much of the music itself has been influenced by Satanism, religion,occultism, Lovecraftian horror, nature and mysticism .The origins of the all those Sub genres - Black Metal,Death Metal etc ..lie somewhere deep in those Led Zepp,Judas Priest and Black Sabbath days.Even the current crop of famous metal bands like Children of Bodom,Slayer,Cannibal Corpse,Cradle of Filth,Lamb of God,Bullet for my Valentine etc...in  many of their songs have devilish music with heavy growling and satanic lyrics.And if anyone want to speculate that these bands are doing all this for publicity then i guess they should better listen to songs like Walk me in  hell, Bed of razors,Waking the demon,Blacken the cursed sun,Follow the reaper.. etc etc...",0

Those documents relate to then-Vice President Dick Cheney’s meetings with oil company lobbyists discussing potential drilling in Iraq. But at least a dozen other declassified records deserve screen time before Sunday’s Oscars show, according to the National Security Archive’s publication today of primary sources from Cheney’s checkered career. The documents show how Cheney built a rap sheet for drunk driving and arranged draft deferments in the 1960s, pitched in on President Gerald R. Ford’s unsuccessful veto of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) in 1974, helped undermine investigations of CIA scandals in 1975, excused President Ronald Reagan’s Iran-contra misdeeds in 1987, mistakenly distrusted Gorbachev and slowed the end of the Cold War in 1989, promoted the global hegemon role for the U.S. in 1992, hid his work with oil companies in 2001 to set energy policy, endorsed torture and warrantless surveillance in the 2000s, played a leading role in trashing Iraq and the Middle East from the Iraq invasion in 2003 to the present, mysteriously went whole days at the White House without his Vice President’s office generating any saved e-mail, and presented a danger to civilians whether they were armed or not by shooting his hunting partner in 2006. Common themes emerge from the documents, including Cheney’s long-standing commitment to defending and expanding presidential power, especially on national security matters, a predilection for the “dark side” in CIA operations from the scandals of the 1970s to the War on Terror, and his disastrously wrong foreign policy judgment. Cheney explained his intellectual history to reporters in 2005 by saying, “Watergate and a lot of the things around Watergate and Vietnam both during the ’70s served, I think, to erode the authority I think the president needs to be effective,” and went on to cite the Iran-Contra congressional committee minority report published below.[1] The documents posted today provide fascinating context for some of Cheney’s most famous moments. After 9/11, on September 16, 2001, Cheney told NBC’s Tim Russert, “We also have to work, though, sort of the dark side, if you will. We've got to spend time in the shadows in the intelligence world. A lot of what needs to be done here will have to be done quietly, without any discussion, using sources and methods that are available to our intelligence agencies, if we're going to be successful.” Just before the invasion of Iraq, on March 16, 2003, Cheney told Russert that when the United States goes in, “we will, in fact, be greeted as liberators.” The vice president was adamant: “to suggest that we need several hundred thousand troops there after military operations cease, after the conflict ends, I don’t think is accurate. I think that’s an overstatement.” Cheney’s message proved to be far from correct. According to a December 2014 Congressional Research Report entitled, “The Cost of Iraq, Afghanistan, and Other Global War on Terror Operations Since 9/11,” the United States spent an estimated $815 billion on the Iraq War, including military operations, base support, weapons maintenance, training Iraq security forces, reconstruction, foreign aid, embassy costs, and veterans’ health care, while more than 4,410 Americans were killed in action and 31,957 wounded in action during the fighting in Iraq.[2]",0

At first, the role he assumed was related to the circumstances of that particular day: President Bush was not in Washington but in a classroom event in Florida, and then, for the remainder of the day, under protection at U.S. military bases in Louisiana and Nebraska. Cheney was the man on the spot. And almost immediately, a second factor came into play: Cheney not only happened to be present in Washington, but he also knew the drills and the protocols to prepare American leaders for an attack on the United States, having participated in the continuity-of-government exercises during the 1980s.",0

One of his first actions was to call Bush and tell him not to return to Washington. Over the next couple of hours, he concentrated on stopping further attacks by hijacked planes. In the confusion that prevailed that morning, it was reported for a time that another passenger plane was getting close to Washington, and Air Force officials wanted to know whether to shoot it down. Cheney told them to go ahead. Later on, both Bush and Cheney would claim that it was the president who made this decision, after Cheney referred it up to him, but close examinations of the evidence have established that Cheney made the shoot-down decision first, on his own, and then cleared it with Bush afterward.",0

Cheney was not alone in having this degree of governmental experience; Colin Powell and Donald Rumsfeld did, too, but Rumsfeld had his hands full running the Pentagon, and Powell was similarly occupied at the State Department. Cheney had no large bureaucracy to manage, and so it was he who had the time, the energy, and, above all, the intense desire to spearhead the administration’s responses to September 11. And so it was Cheney, more than anyone else, who drove the way toward the post-9/11 world.",0

He also said Dick Cheney is a terrorist for accidentally shooting someone while hunting so I guess that word is fair game for Alec too.,"The Bush team’s first reaction to the attacks was one of stunned fury. That night, after the immediate threat of further attacks was eliminated, and just before Cheney departed for the “undisclosed location,” all the top officials (including Bush, Cheney, Powell, Condoleezza Rice, and Rumsfeld) gathered in the White House bunker for their first meeting to decide how to respond. CIA Director George Tenet, who was also there, wrote in his memoir that there was “more raw emotion in one place than I think I’ve ever experienced in my life: anger that this could have happened, shock that it had, overwhelming sorrow for the dead, a compelling sense of urgency that we had to respond and do so quickly.” Robert Gates, who later conversed privately with others on the Bush team, suggested that there was another, unarticulated emotion: guilt for not having stopped al-Qaeda. “I think there was a huge sense among senior members of the administration of having let the country down, of having allowed a devastating attack on America take place on their watch,” he said.",0

He also said Dick Cheney is a terrorist for accidentally shooting someone while hunting so I guess that word is fair game for Alec too.,"Everyone on the Bush team agreed on one intellectual proposition: that the event was of historic importance and America had entered a new era.

He also said Dick Cheney is a terrorist for accidentally shooting someone while hunting so I guess that word is fair game for Alec too.,"For Powell, the fact that America had entered a new era was true simply by definition. The continental United States had not been successfully attacked by a foreign entity since the War of 1812. Now a terrorist organization had done that, and therefore it was a new era. And yet Powell did not believe that America should change its approach to the world in any fundamental ways, and so he did not try to sketch out any new strategy. Instead, his response was to propose new diplomatic initiatives. But to some of Powell’s colleagues, “new era” had a much broader meaning. Rice had been a Soviet specialist, and so, not surprisingly, after September 11 she thought back to the beginning of the Cold War. The fear of Soviet domination of Europe had prompted the Truman administration not only to develop new concepts (containment, deterrence) but also to establish a series of new government institutions (the NSC, the CIA) to deal with the Soviet threat. Rice was laying the intellectual groundwork for the Bush administration to build new governmental structures after September 11, such as the Department of Homeland Security.",0

He also said Dick Cheney is a terrorist for accidentally shooting someone while hunting so I guess that word is fair game for Alec too.,"Then there was Cheney. To the vice president, the “new era” thinking after September 11 meant much more than it did to either Powell or Rice. Cheney cared not about creating new institutions, like Rice, but about increasing the overall power of the executive branch of government. He had spent much of his career trying to lift the restraints on presidential authority. For him, the “new era” after September 11 meant this: The restraints were off. The limits that had been placed on the CIA, the National Security Agency, the FBI, and the Justice Department should no longer apply; the Bush administration should go all out in its pursuit of its adversaries.",0

As he recalled in his memoir, he told his colleagues it was important “that we not allow our mission to be determined by others. We had an obligation to do whatever it took to defend America, and we needed coalition partners who would sign on for that. The mission should define the coalition, not the other way around.”",0

It conducted a pervasive new surveillance program; it established an offshore prison; it opened “black sites” in several countries to interrogate detainees; and, ultimately, by any common definition of the word, it tortured some of those detainees through what it called “enhanced interrogation” techniques.

The surveillance program came before all the others because, immediately after September 11, the Bush team was worried about further terrorist attacks and preoccupied with the task of preventing them. One particular fear was that there might still be al-Qaeda members or teams at large in the United States. U.S. officials had discovered, to their chagrin, that the al-Qaeda operatives who had carried out the attacks had not only slipped into the United States without detection but had also been communicating with al-Qaeda leaders in Afghanistan. On September 11 itself, before Bush had even returned to Washington, Cheney summoned his general counsel, David Addington, the former CIA lawyer who had been for 15 years his closest aide, and asked him to begin thinking about what new authority the president would need to respond to the terrorist attacks. Addington began consulting with other government lawyers, especially White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales, though Addington took charge, much as Cheney did.",0

The intelligence officials came up with a far-reaching program that was approved by Bush on October 4, only three weeks after September 11. It was given the code name Stellar Wind, although later on, when the administration needed an anodyne name to explain the program to Congress and the public, it became better known as the Terrorist Surveillance Program.",0

It could spy on suspected foreign agents inside the country, but only by obtaining a warrant from a special court; without a warrant, it could conduct its activities only overseas. Stellar Wind gave the NSA legal authority to monitor communications in the United States if one party to the conversation was overseas and one of the participants was believed to have some connection to al-Qaeda. These loose standards opened the way for the agency to begin collecting massive amounts of data. Previously, the NSA had to identify particular individuals to target; with the new data, it could discover individuals it had not previously known and subject them to surveillance. The program operated like a drift net.",0

The order establishing the program required that it be reauthorized by Bush roughly every 45 days. At one point in early 2004, Justice Department lawyers, along with FBI Director Robert Mueller and Assistant Attorney General James Comey, objected to one part of the secret program and threatened to resign on the grounds that Bush had no constitutional authority to authorize such surveillance without congressional approval. The following year, The New York Times revealed the existence of the program, prompting Cheney to say that the newspaper should be prosecuted for publishing classified information.",0

Nervous intelligence officials insisted that the administration should at least tell a few congressional leaders what it was doing, and the administration agreed to conduct regular briefings at the White House for the leaders of the congressional intelligence committees. At least twelve such briefings were held—in Cheney’s office, with Cheney presiding, together with CIA and NSA officials.

One of the congressional reforms of the 1970s had been the passage of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, the law that restricted NSA operations inside the United States. The new Terrorist Surveillance Program dramatically weakened that law, but Congress was not asked to approve that weakening.",0

U.S. forces had captured a number of prisoners, from al-Qaeda and the Taliban. The issue was what to do with them: Where should they be held, how should they be treated, should they be put on trial? Here again, Cheney proved to be the driving force, at one point obtaining Bush’s approval for a decision even before Powell and Rice (among others) had had a chance to weigh in.",0

Still, the vice president, who had no direct constitutional or statutory responsibility for these issues, managed to exert his will.",0

He also said Dick Cheney is a terrorist for accidentally shooting someone while hunting so I guess that word is fair game for Alec too.,"In the earliest of these disputes, the administration had to decide on the legal process for handling the new detainees. Should al-Qaeda members be considered prisoners of war or international criminals? Should they stand trial in U.S. civilian courts, charged with the deaths and destruction of September 11? Should they instead be tried in some other kind of court? Powell had appointed one of his aides, Pierre Prosper, to oversee an interagency task force addressing this question. But Prosper’s group was working extremely slowly, and Cheney decided to bypass it. He assigned Addington to draft an order under which the detainees would have none of the rights or legal protections allowed in civilian courts or regular military courts. Instead, they could be held indefinitely without trial, with their fates to be decided by secret military commissions similar to those established in World War II to try Nazi saboteurs. Some officials, including John Bellinger, a lawyer for the NSC, tried to argue that this precedent no longer applied because it had been invalidated by a series of subsequent laws and treaties. But in bureaucratic warfare, Bellinger “was no match for David Addington,” Rice later recalled in her book No Higher Honor. Her own staff, she said, “was at times cut out of the process.”",0

There were no participants from the State Department or the NSC. Three days later, Cheney hand-carried Addington’s draft to a private lunch with the president, and Bush signed it. Rice hadn’t seen it beforehand, and Powell first heard about it from CNN. Rice told Bush that if this happened again, she might resign. Among the many unforeseen consequences of the new order was the creation of intense friction with Britain, America’s closest military ally. Eight of the detainees captured in Afghanistan were British citizens; the British government protested for years that these military commissions set up by the United States did not meet the standards of international law. Thus a pattern was set that would be repeated on other occasions: Cheney would initiate new antiterrorism programs, and Powell would find himself trying to defend them when they incurred the wrath and opposition of other countries.",0

The military didn’t want to keep them in Afghanistan, where any facility in which they were held could become the focus of al-Qaeda attacks. The administration toyed with the idea of holding the detainees on Navy ships, but that didn’t seem like a long-term solution. There were various secure facilities in the United States, such as Alcatraz, Leavenworth, and military brigs, but these options were rejected, too, for a reason that extended beyond security: The administration’s overriding consideration, not always mentioned in public, was the need to get the detainees to talk, particularly about any plans for future attacks, and this was less easy to do if they were on American soil. As one Bush administration official, Douglas Feith, put it in his memoir, America’s spy satellites, which during the Cold War had been able to monitor Soviet troop deployments for signs of an impending attack, were of far less use against a small and nimble enemy like al-Qaeda. Instead, Feith wrote, “the most promising source of intelligence was the terrorists already captured.”",0

Bush transformed from being a President with questionable legitimacy, who had been selected in a controversial election, to taking on immense presidential emergency powers, defining the threat, and attacking the enemy. His administration justified its actions by citing Article II of the U.S. Constitution that outlines the powers of the President as commander in chief as well as legal authorizations passed by Congress. Following 9/11, Bush’s leadership became a rallying point for the nation. The American people were inclined to trust him because they believed in his ability to maintain their safety. In the weeks after the attack, Bush’s approval rating rose to 90 percent—the highest recorded job-approval rating in U.S. presidential history.",0

Bush began his day like any other, by reading his Bible, then taking an early morning run. The biggest headline in the paper that morning read that basketball star, Michael Jordan, would be leaving retirement to rejoin the National Basketball Association (NBA). President Bush was in Florida that day to visit the Emma E. Booker Elementary School in Sarasota to highlight education reform. As he entered the school, he received a report that an airplane had crashed into the World Trade Center in New York City. At that point, it was believed to be an accident. While he was taking part in a reading lesson with the children, his chief of staff informed him, “A second plane hit the second tower…America is under attack.” Bush later wrote about his response: “I made the decision not to jump up immediately and leave the classroom. I didn’t want to rattle the kids. I wanted to project a sense of calm…I had been in enough crises to know that the first thing a leader has to do is to project calm.”",0

Bush was evacuated to Air Force One from which he called Vice President Cheney to inform him that he would make decisions from the plane; Cheney would then implement his orders on the ground. All commercial flights were grounded shortly after the attacks. Bush’s first decision as a wartime commander in chief outlined the rules of engagement for unresponsive airliners near Washington, D.C., and New York City. He instructed Cheney to ensure any suspicious planes were first contacted and ordered to land. If this approach failed, President Bush ordered the planes to be shot down.",0

Communication with Cheney and Rice over the secure line to the Presidential Emergency Operations Center in the White House was intermittent. On the plane, President Bush often received contradictory or wrong information. Bush could not even contact his wife, who was in the Capitol, where she had been scheduled to testify before a Senate Committee that day. After finding out that a fourth plane had gone down in Pennsylvania, Bush asked Cheney, “Did we shoot it down, or did it crash?” No one knew the answer. Bush wondered if he had ordered the death of innocent Americans. Later, he learned about the heroics of the passengers aboard Flight 93 who had attempted to overtake the hijackers to prevent the plane from reaching its target, which may have been the U.S. Capitol or the White House.",0

Only eighteen minutes after the first collision, the second airliner struck the South Tower of the World Trade Center. Airport security, which primarily consisted of poorly paid and barely trained employees of private contractors, had been easily evaded. Bush signed legislation in November 2001 that created the Transportation Security Administration, which federalized all airport security screeners, a drastic departure from his laissez-faire labor policies but a necessary response to ensure national security.",0

He made his position clear, “We will make no distinction between the terrorists who committed these acts and those who harbor them.” He closed with Psalm 23: “Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for You are with me.” Bush decided on three goals in the days that followed the attack: 1. Keep the terrorists from striking again; 2. Make it clear to the country and the world that the United States had embarked on a new kind of war; 3.

Bush set Friday, September 14, 2001, as a National Day of Prayer and Remembrance. At a service held in Washington’s gothic National Cathedral, Bush eloquently comforted the crowd, “Grief and tragedy and hatred are only for a time. Goodness, remembrance, and love have no end. And the Lord of life holds all who die and all who mourn.” He then flew to New York City to visit Ground Zero, the site of the collapsed World Trade Towers, praying and weeping with the families. Bush decided to address the crowd and climbed atop a pile of collapsed metal. He was given a bullhorn, and when people yelled, “We can’t hear you,” Bush memorably shouted back, “I can hear you!…The rest of the world hears you…and the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon!” The 9/11 attacks gave the Bush presidency a clear focus: to protect the American people at home and defeat terrorism abroad.

The principal target of U.S. military intelligence following 9/11 was identifying and addressing the source of the attacks. The immediate efforts of George Tenet, director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), successfully identified al Qaeda, a militant Islamic terrorist organization, and its leader, Osama bin Laden. The Taliban, an extremist Islamic regime that controlled Afghanistan, offered bin Laden sanctuary, and al Qaeda trained thousands of terrorists in camps located in that country. In return for protection, bin Laden utilized his extensive personal fortune to support the Taliban. The insurgent leader had been identified as a threat before the September 11th attacks. The CIA had developed an operation to quietly neutralize bin Laden prior 9/11, but it was never implemented as bin Laden had not been considered a threat to homeland security.",0

After 9/11, the war cabinet quickly acted to target al Qaeda camps in Afghanistan, but, by late September, the Bush administration had yet to determine the scope of the military response to 9/11. Some of his advisors argued for broad military action in both Afghanistan and Iraq. His cabinet was divided on the issue, even within itself: Colin Powell publicly opposed expansion to Iraq, but Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld favored ousting Saddam Hussein as part of the reaction.

Seemingly, terrorists felt that they had an open invitation to attack, only expecting minimum retaliation. In the words of Osama bin Laden, the Americans were “paper tigers” who could be made to “run in less than twenty-four hours.” President Bush decided to respond decisively with American troops in Afghanistan to defeat the Taliban and al Qaeda.

It will not end until every terrorist group of global reach has been found, stopped, and defeated.” Bush declared that the United States considered any nation that supported terrorist groups a hostile regime. In his State of the Union speech in January 2002, President Bush called out an “Axis of Evil” consisting of North Korea, Iran, and Iraq, and he declared all a threat to American security.

The doctrine generally focused on three points. The first was preventive war in which the United States would strike an enemy nation or terrorist group before they had a chance to attack the United States. It focused on deterring any potential attacker. The second point was unilateral action in which the United States would act alone if necessary to defend itself either at home or abroad.

In light of intelligence reports describing an Iraqi plant that could be used to produce weapons of mass destruction (WMDs), the administration considered Saddam Hussein’s regime in Iraq a dangerous threat.

President Bush had personally decided on the need to go to war, long before congressional or U.N. action. In March 2002, Bush sent Vice President Cheney to a conference of eleven countries in the Middle East to build support for a war. Blair and Secretary of State Powell wanted more international cover.

Cheney argued for a quicker move to war while Powell, the former U.S. Army General, counseled a slower approaching involving the United Nations. Professional military advisers also voiced concerns that achieving victory in Iraq would require a long, costly operation and that containment had been an effective policy so far. President Bush opted for further U.N. action with the knowledge that the United States would still likely pursue war with Iraq. Bush went on a public-opinion offensive, stressing that Saddam Hussein and his weapons of mass destruction were a threat to U.S. security. In an August 2002 speech, Vice President Cheney made the Administration’s case quite clear: “Simply stated, there is no doubt that Saddam Hussein now has weapons of mass destruction. There is no doubt that he is amassing them to use them against our friends, against our allies, and against us.”",0

They believed that Iraq did, in fact, have WMDs, but that it did not necessarily have the capabilities to use them that Bush and Cheney believed. Furthermore, there was no evidence connecting Iraq with the attacks of 9/11. Bush continued to assert that the United States could not trust Saddam Hussein with WMDs and that they could easily be transferred to terrorists.",0

A passionate debate ensued that ended with Congress passing a resolution authorizing the President to go to war with Iraq if he found it necessary. Bush spoke to the United Nations on the dangers of WMDs in the hands of a murderous dictator, making his case that it would be far riskier not to act, than to act. The United Nations approved a resolution for rigorous new arms inspections of Iraq, but without a positive response from Iraq. On March 17, 2003, Bush ordered Saddam Hussein to leave Iraq within 48 hours. In a speech to the nation, Bush noted: “Should Saddam Hussein choose confrontation, the American people can know that every measure has been taken to avoid war, and every measure will be taken to win it.”",0

On March 19, British and U.S. forces launched a bombing campaign of military and government offices in Baghdad. Ground troops invaded soon after, cleanly destroying the targets with relatively few American casualties. Iraq did not use any weapons of mass destruction against the invading force. It later was discovered that the regime had actually disposed of its WMD stockpile as requested, but had hid its actions from the world.

Critics charged that the Bush administration did not have an adequate plan for Iraq after the initial war was won and Saddam Hussein was ousted from power. The Bush administration’s strategy had been to reduce the U.S. military presence as Iraq’s stability improved. Yet the goal proved unattainable, owing in part to the power vacuum left by the dismantling of the Iraqi army and the rise of sectarian violence within the two dominant strains of Islam in Iraq.",0

Sectarian violence racked the country as religious and ethnic sects battled for control. Insurgent forces targeted U.S. troops and supporters, as they sought to overthrow the new government. By the summer of 2006, an average of 120 Iraqis were dying each day from insurgent attacks. Al Qaeda saw an opportunity to exploit the instability in Iraq, and its recruits flooded into the country to train terrorists.",0

General David Petraeus was appointed to oversee a “surge” of 20,000 troops in January 2007. American troops patrolled cities on foot with members of the Iraqi military to prepare them to step into a more independent role. The Democrat-controlled Congress vehemently disapproved of Bush’s actions and attempted to pass a war-funding bill mandating a troop withdrawal deadline later in 2007. Bush vetoed the bill, and, on May 25, 2007, he signed a bill fully funding the war with no set withdrawal date. American military deaths were at their highest average for the first several months of the surge, but there was a clear shift in the culture; counterinsurgency tips from Iraqi civilians doubled by May 2007 as U.S. troops created coalitions with Iraqis to increase stability. By the end of 2008, U.S. military and Iraqi civilian deaths had both declined by more than 60 percent.",0

The administration’s plan for withdrawal was to reduce the number of troops as the situation improved until the number deployed reached pre-surge levels; the United States would then reassess the situation. In 2008, the Bush administration entered into the Strategic Framework Agreement, which established a political, economic, and security relationship with the new government of Iraq; the agreement encouraged Iraqi sovereignty and created a normalized diplomatic relationship with it. Bush also signed the Status of Forces Agreement, defining the security relationship between the United States and Iraq as well as providing a plan for U.S. withdrawal by December 31, 2011, provided that stability continued to increase. In all, more than 4,200 U.S. soldiers died in Iraq during Bush’s presidency.",0

It allowed the President to use force against those involved in the attacks or to prevent future attacks.

These tribunals functioned differently from courts within the U.S. legal system. The Bush administration decided to hold the accused terrorists at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, without a right to a writ of habeas corpus, that is, they could not challenge whether the U.S. government was holding them legally and therefore could be held indefinitely. The Bush administration also classified those accused terrorists as unlawful enemy combatants instead of prisoners of war, which placed them outside the protections of the Geneva Conventions.",0

These enhanced interrogation methods included sleep deprivation, slapping, waterboarding (simulated drowning), and subjecting prisoners to cold in order to extract information. Many critics considered these methods to be torture.

It also came to light that the CIA had been using rendition to move suspected terrorists from one country to another for the purposes of interrogating them. Under the policy of rendition, the CIA transferred prisoners to secret locations around the world that were outside the U.S. legal system to try to extract information about future terrorist attacks and the al Qaeda network, for example.

President Bush created the Terrorist Surveillance Program, which allowed the National Security Agency (NSA) to monitor electronic communications without warrants to collect information about terrorist activities. Under the program, one of the people being monitored had to be a suspected terrorist, and one of them had to be outside the United States. When the program became public in 2005, critics were concerned that the program violated the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) of 1978, which was passed after the Watergate scandal. After President Richard Nixon ordered domestic spying on U.S. citizens, Congress passed FISA to regulate government surveillance, limiting it to foreign intelligence purposes and requiring that the government obtain warrants from a special FISA court before engaging in surveillance. Many Americans were concerned that the Terrorist Surveillance Program violated privacy rights and civil liberties for U.S. citizens. The Bush administration argued that it did not have to obtain warrants for this wiretapping because it had the authority through the commander-in-chief powers and the Authorization for Use of Military Force Act passed in the wake of the 9/11 attacks.",0

Critics argued that if the United States sanctioned torture and ignored its legal safeguards, the country was turning its back on important founding principles such as the rule of law, the presumption of innocence and the protection of civil liberties.

When he took office in 2001, the United States was spending a little over $500 million a year to fight AIDS throughout the world, but the money was spread across six different agencies that appeared to lack a clear strategy. In Africa, HIV/AIDS had become an epidemic, with one out of every four adults carrying the disease in some countries. By 2010, the total number infected in Africa was projected to surpass 100 million people. Bush’s first step in fighting the disease was to make a commitment of $200 million to the U.N. Global Fund to fight HIV/AIDS on May 11, 2001.",0

Bush announced the International Mother and Child HIV Prevention Initiative on June 19, 2002. The initiative focused on treating AIDS in women and stopping the spread of the disease to children by training local health care workers and purchasing medicine over the next five year. In 2003, Bush proposed a $15-billion initiative, the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), which Congress passed to bring relief to Africa. By 2008, five years after the passage of PEPFAR, there was a large increase in the number of Africans who received AIDS medicine, from 50,000 to 3 million people. The plan was renewed in summer of 2008, which doubled the U.S. commitment to fight HIV/AIDS. By the time Bush left office in January 2009, PEPFAR had paid for the treatment of 2.1 million people and testing and counseling for more than 57 million.

In June 2005, Bush announced his President’s Malaria Initiative, a $1.2 billion program spanning five years that would fight the disease in fifteen African countries; it aimed to cut malaria deaths in half by the end of the plan. The initiative depended on prevention efforts such as indoor spraying of mosquitoes and insecticide-treated bed nets as well as delivering medicine to protect Africans from the ravages of malaria. The President’s Malaria Initiative continued after Bush left office, with the U.S. government’s Malaria Strategies for 2009-2014 and 2015-2020, hoping to continue to prevent or control the disease.",0

The Bush policy sought to treat economic aid as a long-term investment, rather than as short-term aid. The program invested $6.7 billion in 35 partner countries. Through this policy, the Bush administration expanded the number of U.S. free trade agreements from three to seventeen.

Be mindful that I am not saying that those she does this to are toxic individuals; I am saying that in the course of distancing herself like that, she is implying that there is something “wrong” and “toxic” about them.",0

@piersmorgan https://t.co/El6VIZjLA3","Because Piers Morgan is a revolting human being, and probably deep down realises it and is very thin skinned when he thinks someone has slighted him for some reason. The first time I came across this specimen was on the show ‘Have I Got News For You’ back in 1996, when Ian Hislop disrespected him. In retaliation Morgan, then editor of the Daily Mirror (he was fired a few years later after he published faked photographs of Iraqi prisoners being abused by British Army personnel), threatened Hislop saying Hislop would be ""getting new neighbours"", insinuating Morgan would be using his paper to investigate him. Hislop has accused Morgan of having him (Hislop) followed and his house watched, and Morgan himself stated his intention to “severely embarrass and humiliate (Hislop) and lower his standing in the public eye”, promising he would unleash a fusillade of revelations about the 'secret' Hislop, and asked Daily Mirror readers “Have you got any photographs Ian might prefer not to reach a wider audience?”.",0

3. Note how his uniform is devoid of sweat, sag, dust and his rolled sleeves are almost perfectly presented just above the elbow four inches deep - almost like he was on parade!
4. Note how he isn't wearing body armour! Or helmet!
5. The desert boots are again devoid of dust, dirt, sweat and grime as is the webbing!

Bright and crazy outfits. Wild wigs in white, blonde, jet black, orange, pink and even rainbow. Freakish makeup. She wears all of the things that are guaranteed to get people talking the next day. Some people think she's tacky, while others feel that she is a fashion icon; either way, people talk about her wardrobe. She basically makes herself like a Barbie doll, mixing and matching clothes and styles in unpredictable combinations. The ""Barbie chic"" led to Mattel creating an actual Nicki Minaj Barbie doll, which was sold to charity.",0

Regarding her fashion, again she has never failed to surprise me. She has gone from over-the-top to subtle in the recent times, and she has mentioned that this was temporary.

Rather than to find out if he’s done his ironing or to see where CNN have shipped him off to, I follow Morgan to keep track of his endless Twitter arguments with other celebrities. BBC Football pundit Gary Lineker seems to be the latest target in which Morgan fires his venomous words at, thankfully, to no avail due to Lineker’s wit and fan base.

Similarly, this needless plaguing and harassment mirrors Morgans interviewing style, which has again, been some subject to contention. Interviews with such public figures from this side of the Atlantic and over with out American cousins have seen their fair share of heat and vigor. In particular, Christine O’Donnell of the American Republican Party was forced to walk off her interview with Morgan on CNN due to his disrespectful, rude tone. From politicians to magicians, Penn Jilette, the larger half of Magic act Penn and Teller, came under scrutiny for his beliefs over religion.

One aspect in particular emphasises the devil behind Morgans celebrity status. The 2004 Iraqi photo hoax lead to Morgan being sacked from The Mirror newspaper. Morgan, as the editor of the paper, published “crude hoax photographs” of the Queens Lancashire Regiment abusing and beating Iraqi prisoners. Consqeuently, Morgans actions in publishing these photographs, given the sensitivity of the subject at the time and also due to the obvious questionability regarding the validity of the photo’s, and lead to his dismissal from The Mirror. Morgan’s actions prompted Iraqi revenge attacks on British forces over in Iraq which left some British troops dead.

As someone who is more than keen in finding a career in journalism, it becomes more and more difficult to remain undeterred by people like Morgan who share my aspired profession. As a person who evidently values money over the lives of respected human beings fighting for our country, he represents the black mark that smudges the reputation of journalism. Ironically, journalists are mediated by other journalists who cry to the public over how honesty in the reporting circuit his hard to find, with writers merely looking for a story and nothing more.",0
1451447715171348505,Piers Morgan is such a scumbag,"This perception angers me, as it must do with the majority of journalists who enjoy their work and see it as an art form, as well as an adored occupation. Stories such as The News Of The World phone hacking scandal, in which Piers Morgan is also accused of doing, signifies the disgraceful and abhorrent minority of broadcasters and communicators who strive so hard for a newsworthy story that they forget their own personal norms and identity. Perhaps this is just part of the game? Maybe some will argue that I too, if I am fortunate to join the elite circuit, will fall victim to abusing and mocking those in order to extract information or breaking all manner of conduct in order to get a story?",0

Momentarily, we all have slips of morality and personal obedience to our own conscious knowledge of right and wrong. However, I strongly believe that it takes a large shift in brain chemistry and environment to know when your wrongs can be breached and your rights ignored. As for Piers Morgan, his deficiency is clear. He is an insincere, autocratic and entirely vile excuse for a human specimen that shames journalists as an entity. He epitomizes everything wrong with journalists and everything immoral and sadistic about the humankind.",0

This whole year has reminded me of running the Mirror during the big stories.” Today’s big story is that Trump has been discharged from hospital and is telling the US not to be scared of Covid-19. Morgan is trending on Twitter for tearing a strip off Trump while also saying they may still be friends. Another example of the liberal fascists – why should the two be mutually exclusive, he says.",0
1451447715171348505,Piers Morgan is such a scumbag,"The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines woke as “aware of and actively attentive to important facts and issues (especially issues of racial and social justice)”. Nothing wrong with that, you might think. But Morgan says the word has been corrupted. He prefers his own definition: “Woke means being constantly self-righteously certain that your ultraliberal, virtue-signalling opinion is not only always right but anyone who disagrees is an idiot.” It’s funny, I say – take away the ultraliberal virtue-signalling bit and you could be talking about yourself. “Yeah! I am absolutely prone to self-righteous outbursts and thinking I’m right. The difference is I’m happy to have debate.” It’s true. We spend the next two and a half hours doing just that.",0
1451447715171348505,Piers Morgan is such a scumbag,"Morgan’s new book, Wake Up: Why The World Has Gone Nuts, is a fast, entertaining read. He has a point – society has become increasingly polarised in recent years and cancel culture is terrifying – although many of his targets are paper tigers or simply ludicrous. Morgan, 55, says debate has to become more open and nuanced: “Stephen Fry said you don’t change the opinions of arseholes by behaving like an even bigger arsehole.” But isn’t he guilty of that? “Yes. And when I’ve waged various campaigns, I very rarely win. The louder you scream and the less you cross the divide and sit with your opponents, the less you achieve.” He is still learning and evolving, he says. “Contrary to public myth, I’ve never actually thought I’m perfect, even if I’ve conveyed that impression.”",0

1451447715171348505,Piers Morgan is such a scumbag,"At the beginning of the book, Morgan says these battles have been fought largely on social media, primarily Twitter. He points out that only 20% of British and American people use Twitter; of those, 10% post 80% of tweets. In other words, we are talking about a tiny bubble. If he finds the tone so upsetting, wouldn’t the simple thing be to get off the platform? He grins. “Yes, but I like it. My problem is I like combative debate with people and I like going after people and I like people coming after me. I thrive off that.”",0
1451447715171348505,Piers Morgan is such a scumbag,"Rather than no-platforming, Morgan does the opposite. He invites people with views he can’t stand on to GMB so he can annihilate them. But that simply fuels the culture wars. Last year, the journalist Benjamin Butterworth came on the show to defend the notion that there are 100 genders. Morgan ridiculed him, claiming he identified as a two-spirit penguin. It felt as if he was punching down.",0
1451447715171348505,Piers Morgan is such a scumbag,"“Hang on, hang on, get your ducks in a row,” he says pugnaciously. “He had signed a petition to have me fired. He was trying to cancel me.

1451447715171348505,Piers Morgan is such a scumbag,"Maybe, but so did Morgan, who was reduced to mimicking Butterworth’s voice. When I mention it, he looks as close to contrite as I have ever seen him. “To be honest, I regret that. That actually does stray into being a bit of a bully. You lose the argument when you do that. You’re right.”",0
1451447715171348505,Piers Morgan is such a scumbag,"Morgan’s Twitter bio is a quote from his grandmother, Margot Barber: “One day you’re cock of the walk, the next a feather duster.” It is a perfect summary of Morgan’s yo-yo career, although he has never remained a feather duster for long. Piers Stefan Pughe-Morgan, who grew up in Sussex, joined the Sun in his early 20s, dropped his double-barrelled name and ran the showbusiness column Bizarre. At 28, he was made editor of the News of the World; by 30, he was editing the Daily Mirror.",0
1451447715171348505,Piers Morgan is such a scumbag,Morgan had a great run as editor of the Mirror – it was a lively red-top ferociously opposed to the Iraq war – then it all ended in disgrace. He was sacked in 2004 for running photos of alleged Iraq war atrocities committed by British forces that he couldn’t stand up. The newspaper later apologised under the headline “Sorry … we were hoaxed”.,0
1451447715171348505,Piers Morgan is such a scumbag,"He went from newspapers to TV, judging Britain’s Got Talent and its American version. In 2008, he won the first series of Celebrity Apprentice in the US, hosted by Trump. In 2011, he replaced the legendary talkshow host Larry King on CNN. Three years later, Piers Morgan Live was axed. Since then, he has been omnipresent on British TV, presenting GMB, the documentary series Killer Women With Piers Morgan and Piers Morgan’s Life Stories.",0
1451447715171348505,Piers Morgan is such a scumbag,"Morgan has a planet-sized ego, but unlike Trump he is not a pathological narcissist. That is what makes him fascinating: he is self-aware. Nor is he content to be a reactionary old git. He is not approaching his attack on wokery as a steel-toe-capped rightwinger, he insists. “I’m a liberal to my bootstraps. I ran the Daily Mirror for 10 years.” But he says he is horrified by what he is seeing. He talks about the vitriol aimed at JK Rowling after she mocked an article referring to “people who menstruate” rather than women. “Are we really at the stage where JK Rowling, one of the most woke people you could ever meet, ends up being a hashtag #RIPJKRowling? That’s horrendous.”",0
1451447715171348505,Piers Morgan is such a scumbag,"But his attack on wokeness goes way beyond JK Rowling. Take mental health, for example. He thinks that encouraging people to talk about it turns us all into bleating wimps. “It’s OK to man up. It doesn’t have to be a shameful thing to say, which makes people want to go off and kill themselves. Life is bloody tough. It comes back to the Rocky Balboa quote: ‘It’s not how many times you’re hit, it’s how many times you get knocked over and pick yourselves up.’ And I think that’s what life is.”",0
1451447715171348505,Piers Morgan is such a scumbag,"It can seem incredibly insensitive, I say. “I’m not trying to diminish people who have things like clinical depression. I interviewed Alastair Campbell this week. I know how serious that has been for him and his family, but I do think there is a massive difference between that and general life anxieties.” He suggests that we should distinguish clearly between mental illness and mental health. “Mental illness is a clinically diagnosed thing. Mental illness can be classified and treated. But right now everybody is being encouraged to think they are mentally ill in one way or another.”",0
1451447715171348505,Piers Morgan is such a scumbag,"What he really hates is victim culture – rewarding people for failure. He talks about giving schoolchildren a participation prize for coming last. “What message does that send kids, telling them they’ll never lose in life? When I got fired from the Mirror, I didn’t get a participation prize. I just got humiliated, shamed and sent home. They even asked for my fax machine back. There’s a real world out there, Simon.”",0
1451447715171348505,Piers Morgan is such a scumbag,"Morgan has four children: three boys from his first marriage, one daughter from his second, to the journalist Celia Walden – the daughter of the former Tory minister George Walden – whom he married in 2010. In the book, he writes: “If you came last in a race on sports day, you won nothing but well-deserved ignominy and ridicule.” If he had a child who always came last, would he feel differently? He looks slightly embarrassed. “I did say to my kids from the day they were born: ‘I’ll never criticise you if you give 100%.’”",0
1451447715171348505,Piers Morgan is such a scumbag,"And so to Trump. Morgan has been damning of the US president’s handling of the pandemic. In April, he wrote a MailOnline article that began “Shut the f**k up, President Trump”. Trump unfollowed him on Twitter within 24 hours.",0
1451447715171348505,Piers Morgan is such a scumbag,"Many people ask why it took you so long to condemn him, I say. Ah, there we go again, he responds – typical wokeys, refusing to recognise that Trump rescued the US economy pre-pandemic, took decisive trade action against China, forged a relationship with North Korea. Yes, I say, but they would not praise that, because they had already written him off as a racist, a misogynist and a liar. “I’ve never seen Trump be racist when I’ve been around him,” he says. “What he does is pander to racists. He doesn’t want to lose their vote, because ultimately Trump is about winning. I don’t think there’s a principled bone in his body.”",0
1451447715171348505,Piers Morgan is such a scumbag,"Would he be so tolerant of a president who pandered to racists if they were not friends? “Probably not,” he admits. “When I came back here from CNN, I could count on one hand the number of people who contacted me – and he did, repeatedly. For all his faults, Trump can be very loyal.”",0
1451447715171348505,Piers Morgan is such a scumbag,"I have always wondered what Trump smells like. Another snort of laughter. “Quite expensive aftershave and not overly done, just a light, gentle aroma. You imagine he’d smell like some flamboyant nightclub owner in the 70s, but he doesn’t.” And the hair product? “You get a whiff of hairspray, ’cause it is permanently coiffured. He’s actually a germaphobe. If you coughed, it was like you’d got the plague and out would come the Purell [hand sanitiser] and he wouldn’t shake hands with people. He was obsessive about it. Then, when he gets hit by a real killer virus, he treats it like a bloody casual load of nonsense. I don’t get that.”",0
1451447715171348505,Piers Morgan is such a scumbag,"Often it is hard to separate the personal from the political in Morgan’s spats. Take Prince Harry and Meghan, whom he has attacked relentlessly as hypocrites. Is it not also partly because Meghan, who had been a friend, ghosted him after she hooked up with Harry? “If Meghan Markle had done to you what she did to me, you would have been pissed off,” he says. “I literally put her in a cab from my pub after a two-hour chat. The moment she got in that cab, she went to a dinner party where Harry was; the next night they had a one-on-one at Soho House or wherever it was and I never hear from her again. Gone.” He sounds like a man spurned. “I just found her incredibly shallow and the social-climbing element quite appalling.”",0
1451447715171348505,Piers Morgan is such a scumbag,"But yes, he accepts – maybe he has been too hard on them at times. “My son Stanley said: ‘Dad, why do you care so much about Harry and Meghan?’ and I said: ‘I don’t really.’ And he said: ‘Well, it looks as if you do.’”",0
1451447715171348505,Piers Morgan is such a scumbag,"I wonder much the same thing as Stanley. How serious is Morgan about his woke hatred? Two years ago, he posted a screenshot of Daniel Craig carrying his baby in a papoose and tweeted: “Oh 007.. not you as well?!!! #papoose #emasculatedBond”. Papoosegate went global. “It ended up as two minutes on the NBC nightly news based on my tweet. How can that be right? That’s just an illiberal liberal explosion around the world completely out of kilter with the one observation I had, which is I don’t like papooses.” He manages to look outraged. Oh, come off it, I say: you must have been thrilled. He snorts with laughter. “If you’re a contrarian who likes to be at the centre of everyone’s thought processes, it was fantastic!”",0
1451447715171348505,Piers Morgan is such a scumbag,"And does he really give a flying fungal mycoprotein about vegan sausage rolls? “Do I sit here and genuinely feel a pathological hatred of papooses or vegan sausage rolls? No. Do I find it quite amusing to do a tweet or express an opinion on GMB about how I don’t like them, which is genuinely true? Yes. But I don’t want to stop people eating them or wearing them.”",0
1451447715171348505,Piers Morgan is such a scumbag,"Wake Up is a strange book. A third of the way through, Morgan seems to have forgotten about woke. The pandemic is raging – and so is he about the government’s handling of it. Whenever he gets the chance on GMB, he pulverises the clueless politicians for their incompetence, laziness and lies. (Soon enough, ministers boycotted the show.) Professionally, he has had a magnificent pandemic. For the first time in ages, he started punching up at worthy targets. “What the pandemic gave me was something to go at really, really hard, like the Iraq war. And I think I’ve been at my best journalistically when I’ve had something to get my teeth stuck into. When there’s nothing really going on and I’m creating a few firestorms because that’s my instinctive nature, that’s me at my worst – just a bit bored, sinking my fangs, which can be ferocious, into fairly inconsequential things, contributing to the general culture wars in a not-particularly-helpful manner.”",0
1451447715171348505,Piers Morgan is such a scumbag,"Was he in danger of becoming a shock-jock? “Yes. When there isn’t much going on, you can be in danger of just spouting off about stuff and it looks as if you’re just constantly furious.”",0

Being on maternity was the perfect reason to ‘excuse’ herself from the banquet, saving blushes all round. It was a very wise move and frankly, Trump did not need the Duchess there, he only really cared about being there with the Queen. Prince Harry attended to add to the whole royal regalia scene in support of his grandmother and father. I am absolutely sure, if Prince Harry and Prince William were able to smile and shake hands with Trump with grace and politeness, the Duchess would have been able too as well. They are professionals at this game. As a woman, I can say when I was 4 weeks after giving birth, the idea of making small talk at the dinner table for hours would have been a nightmare - so I am sure, diplomacy apart, the Duchess probably genuinely did not want to attend such a full-on event.",0

I think for emotional reasons it is probably very difficult to bring a Minister and their officials “to heel” but some times you simply have to. Perhaps the PMO needs some more senior people with good judgement, who are empowered to examine ministerial files and report directly to the Prime Minister. If Trudeau selected the right people and set some rules (i.e. Never call a Minister’s office and try to give orders, be transparent, be accountable.) these sorts of mistakes might be avoided.

However I don’t think he has much idea about populism and he doesn’t comprehend why many Western Canadians see themselves as still being “outsiders”.

Sir McKenzie Bowell - Dec. 1894 to Apr. 1896. Bowell became Prime Minister by default when two people died and one person had to quit due to bad health starting in 1891. Bowell, the only Prime Minister to serve from the Senate, was chosen because he was senior in cabinet. He screwed up every major challenge that came his way (most notably the question about Manitoba’s Catholic school system) and eventually his own cabinet stopped inviting him to meetings. Charles Tupper was chosen by the party to lead them into the 1896 election.
2. Sir Charles Tupper - May to July 1896. Serving for just two months, he had the shortest time in office of any Prime Minister to date.
3. Arthur Meighen - July 1920 to December 1921 and June to September 1926. Canada’s Winston Churchill. Brilliant. Ambitious. However, universally hated by Canadians and totally incompetent at keeping power. Lost his first election by a wide margin. Couldn’t win a majority his second time out and couldn’t keep power for more than three months once he tried to form a government. Tried to make a comeback in the 1930s, but couldn’t even win his own seat.
4. Joe Clark - June 1979 to March 1980. Won the Conservative party’s first election since 1958 with a slim minority and decided to push a non-confidence vote. He lost it.
5. John Turner - June 1984 to September 1984. His most notable accomplishment in office was appointing party members to lifetime patronage appointments, which cost him the next two elections.
6. Kim Campbell - June 1993 to November 1993. To be fair, the Conservative Party had already been fractured by Brian Mulroney, but she took the party from over 150 seats in parliament to two, even losing her own. Canada’s first female prime minister hasn’t been followed by another in 28 years.
7. Paul Martin - 2003–2006. Took a party that had won three straight majority governments (first time in history) and reduced it to a weak third place by the time he left. Pursued austerity policies that crippled the Canadian economy. Laid the groundwork for Stephen Harper’s ten year rule.
Justin? He’s gotten things done. He won two straight elections. He looks like he’s going to win a third. He’s legalized marijuana. He’s reformed Canada Pension Plan benefits. Despite being hit hard by coronavirus, Canadians complain a lot but we’re still in good shape.",0

Justin Trudeau is a puppet of the hard Leftist executive board of the Liberal Party of Canada, trading on the surname of his putative father, Pierre. Justin Trudeau takes advice from Gerald Butts, his clooose buddy since university days.
2. Justin is a dilettente, never having finished a university course of studies. His “teaching experience” was as a “substitute teacher”, with the complimentary temporary licence granted him by the Government of B.C. He is a playboy who likes to drink wine, party, wear bespoke clothing, and has a sock-fetish.
3. Justin is very appreciative of the Chinese Communist Party and was a good friend and accolyte of Cuban dictator Fidel Castro, whom Justin very closely resembles, and should submit to a public DNA test to prove his lineage. He does not resemble Pierre Trudeau. Justin is a communist in everything but name, and his politics appear to bear this out. He is anti-democratic, unless it suits him.
4. Justin is becoming a Dictator of Canada, almost on the verge of declaring the Emergency Act (the former “War Measures Act”.
5. Justin’s mother, Margaret, is a schizophrenic of the “bi-polar” variety. There is a very good likelihood that those same genes and DNA occupy Justin’s brain as well. His shilly-shallying and bullying in politics, and his penchant for hiding and acting (with a soft, lisping, quasi-hypnotic, calculatedly “calm” voice and over-enunciated speech pattern) supports suspicion that he is a narcissist and a manipulator.
6. Justin is also an unconvicted crook with regard to the hushed-up SNC Lavalin scandal, for which he should be convicted and jailed — but the RCMP is in his pocket, along with the Pravda/Isvestia style favouritism that he promotes in the Mainstream Media, by bribing them with “grants” as “favoured journalists” who will NOT present any negative news concerning the Libs or Trudeau.
7. Aside from all the above, he looks like a light-in-the-heels Marseilles gangster.
8. He cashiered Jody Wilson-Rabauld when she wouldn’t do his bidding to change her mind about the need to bring Quebec company SNC Lavalin to account in court. Why? To curry more favour with Quebeckers and the French “money moguls” of Quebec, many of whom are just Franco-hogs at the Federal trough — even though Quebec has NEVER SIGNED the Constitution Act of 1982, and technically should NOT be allowed to participate in any Canadian legal/constitutional/foreign dealings and determinations.
9. I don’t *HATE* Trudeau, but I do wish that God Almighty would arrange his political downfall and the utter decimation of Liberal Party of Canada prestige and power in Canada. The Liberal Party assumes that it is the “natural governing party”; it is time to dissolve these derriere-kissing hacks, as the Americans once did with their pre-Republican “Whig” Party. Corruption all the way.

If it was Pierre Trudeau, he would have countered with the fact that “ranked voting” does favour the electorate’s second choice, and if your party has no chance of being the second choice of the electorate, there may be something wrong with your party’s ideology and platform. He would then tell the opposition to “fuddle-duddle” themselves and use his majority to pass the legislation on “ranked ballot”.",0

Most of the work is done in committee meetings, most of the work done in the House of Commons is as dull as watching paint dry, and only during Question Period is there great excitement (and perhaps some “good television”).

In good economic times the government should balance the budget, eliminate the deficit and pay down the national debt so that when the inevitable hard times come there will be gas in the economic tank.

Do our indigenous peoples have clean water and better living conditions as promised? Is there a comprehensive infrastructure program to update our aging cities? Did the federal government increase health payments to the provinces? Is the Canadian military any closer to replacing their aging clapped out equipment? Is there a comprehensive plan for moving forward on climate change, global warming and renewable energy? The ball was dropped horribly on the Meng Wanzhou file and now we have Canadians imprisoned in China and farmers without markets for their crops thanks to Chinese retaliation. Almost from the git go thanks to the Phoenix pay disaster Trudeau can’t even pay the civil servants properly, and every attempt to fix that ends up worse than the one before (as a retired federal government senior IT manager I really can’t believe the continued ineptitude on this), the government is months and months behind paying benefits to Canada’s veterans, the list goes on and on and on. We’ve paid billions of dollars for a pipeline that will never, ever be built just so Justin could string on Albertans on the one hand and piss off the people of British Columbia and numerous indigenous groups on the other hand.

Instead, Justin wrung his hands and was too gutless to make the big decisions. When asked early on if he was going to shut down the borders he kept whining “Everything’s on the table”, but by the time he finally had the guts to call the ball the horse was way out of the barn. If his old man Pierre Trudeau had been asked up front “How far will you go with border closings”, he would have replied “Just watch me” and slammed the borders shut. He wasn’t afraid to make the hard choices. Here we are now over eight months in and we still don’t have an overall national plan (it’s still very much every province for itself), we’re only just starting to put a vaccine distribution plan together (even Trump’s US is ahead of us on this), we’ve had even more ethics scandals with WE, and the Trudeau government continues to place fast and loose with the economy and keeps bungling any relief programs.",0

For two years she sat on the board of what is now called the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Foundation – a multimillion dollar global philanthropic venture set up by her husband.

Even with my pass, I couldn't get close to the area at the front of the stage, so huge was the crowd of supporters. When he ended his speech and that damn-yet-wonderful song started to play for the millionth time, I felt more alive and hopeful than I'd ever felt about this country before or probably since. I had tears in my eyes, and a man in front of me turned and high-fived me, which turned into us grasping hands together and pumping them in the air in joy and victory (this moment is in fact caught on camera at the end of the documentary film The War Room, which I find extremely cool).",0

Whatever misgivings I have -- and I do have many -- I'd likely vote for him if he could run for office again, because of his ability to manage a nation better than any of the other options out there who have any remote chance of taking office.

It was an unpopular decision, and it cost Governor Clinton, who was up for re-election, dearly. In May, the Cubans rioted against squalid conditions; some 300 of them escaped, and Mr. Clinton had to call in the National Guard. By August the White House had decided to send even more Cuban refugees to Fort Chaffee. The Governor lost the election.
Carter also was known for having his own views on political endorsements. He basically avoided them. Which meant anytime he did say something about a candidate a lot was read into it. He called a candidate running against Clinton in the primary trust worthy and honest. So naturally the press ignored the compliment to that candidate and ran it as “Carter implies Clinton isn’t trustworthy and honest”.",0

In 1980, Jimmy Carter ran for reelection for a second four-year as President and Bill Clinton ran for reelection for a second two-year term as Governor of Arkansas. Both of them lost reelection. Carter became the first President to be defeated for reelection since Herbert Hoover and Bill Clinton became the youngest ex-governor in the history of the United States.
2. Carter's influence as an Ex-President and Comparisons to to Clinton: When Clinton sought the Presidency in 1992, he was often compared to as Jimmy Carter in 1980. Clinton created distance, maybe too much distance from Carter. They were both Southern Governors who were not part of the Democratic Liberal Establishment.
3. Many of Clinton's early appointments served in the Carter Administration, such as Secretary of State Warren Christopher. Democratic officeholders or potential officeholders were creating distance between themselves and Carter. In fact, Carter felt he was given less respect by Clinton than he was with Presidents Reagan and Bush (41).
4. At the same time, Carter had an independent streak which made him come across as a “pain in the ass” to other Presidents when it comes to speaking out on policy. It was rare for Clinton to actually get Carter on his side for support: NAFTA and Haiti.
5. Leadership Style: While Carter ran the country without much support from a Democratic Congress, Clinton governed as a liberal being too close to the Congress, during his first two-years in office. But, when the Democrats lost the Congress in 1994, Clinton governed as a centrist, finding the middle ground between the Democratic Liberal Establishment and Republican Southerners who governed the Congress.",0

And we may never know the most of it. Let’s say you had two Southern Baptist Democrats occupying the White House who believed strongly in what their church teaches, but when it came to matters of protecting what’s really important, one’s soul and not selling out for expediency’s sake, Jimmy Carter was definitely the more principled of the two. Carter also had to have been thoroughly embarrassed by Clinton’s uncontrolled sexual appetite which led to the Lewinsky Impeachment disaster, on top of previous instances of Bubba’s bad judgment concerning women and honoring both his oath to the country and marital vows. It must have galled Carter privately to see how relatively fast and easy it was for Clinton to not only have paid off his legal fees through his book, but also speaking fees. Carter, who was only defeated on political issues, faced economic ruin when he returned to GA. His and Roslyn’s peanut farm was poorly managed by his alcoholic brother Billy and they had to literally scrap their way back. Thankfully his staff bought him a garage worth’s of brand new woodworking tools and he put them to good use, making and selling country furniture, donating the proceeds to charity and getting involved with Habitat for Humanity. It was only then, and when he was able to get a teaching job with Emory University at the Carter Center for Peace located in his Presidential Library, that he and Roslyn were able to make it back. It was a tough road and he had to do it during a time when he’d just taken quite a political beating by Ronald Reagan. Clinton barely consulted with Carter, which was odd considering the fact both men ran for the WH as southern governors and Carter must’ve felt the sting as any experienced older leader might’ve. LOL, Bubba got his Jimmy Carter moment during his wife’s run in 2016 from Obama. If anybody had reason for some resentment, it was Joe Biden but compared to the Clintons, he understood Obama’s tight dilemna after all, he took his time in deciding whether or not he was going to run and had the added emotional burden resulting from the loss of his son Beau to brain cancer. By the time Biden could’ve possibly gotten into the ring, Clinton and Sanders had basically locked up most of the delegates and Biden knew his entrance would’ve been terribly disruptive. What’s great this year is the absence of the Clinton effect. I voted for Clinton in the 2008 primary and in the 2016 general election. But we need a change, be it Sanders or Biden; and either could sweep the White House from Trump and his bunch.",0

Following 911 the president was confronted with a national crisis. How he handled things was going to have a significant impact on our nation at the time and into the future. It was the first crisis of this kind he had ever faced and that any president would have faced. President Bush was giving one of the most important addresses to the country and all the dignitaries and self important people were there. It was a big deal. These big events are governed by protocol when it comes to positioning and sitting people. Well protocol dictates that the order of Presidents is the the last president is higher on protocol list than the second to last. So according to protocol President Clinton was to be sitting next to George W as he was the sitting president. Then next to the Clintons was George H.W. Bush. The Clintons knew the the President was receiving a lot of support from his parents. The Clintons insisted on breaking with protocol so that George and Barbara Bush could sit with their son to provide support during what was the most significant event their son would ever be confronted with. A small gesture that reveals a lot about the Clinton’s awareness and priorities. George W. related that event and also the respect the Clintons showed President H.W. Bush after defeating him in the 1992 election led to the appointment of President Clinton and H.W. to head up the Haiti relief efforts. The Clintons are reportedly now very close to the Bushes, and Bill (according to W.) spends more time with his parents in Maine than anyone else in the family.",0

I met her at the White House Correspondents Association dinner in 1995 and again at my college graduation from the University of Maryland College Park in 1996.Both times I found her to be very gracious and with an overall sense of calm about her.  At the National Correspondent's Association Dinner, I remember thinking that not only was the former president a really big guy, but also a larger than life personality.  While Bill Clinton quite literally lights up the room, I found Hillary to be a great compliment to that - she was no shrinking violet and was right there with him greeting guests and moving about the room.",0

My parents, who were not fans of President Clinton, joined us backstage.  Within a couple minutes she pulled up in a mini van.  The Secret Service were all around her and she stepped out to greet us.  My mother immediately rushed in to hug her and gave the secret service a big scare.  Thankfully Hillary gave them an ""it's OK"" look and they stayed back.  To this day I am not sure if my mother knew how close she was to being accosted by the secret service.",0

It’s not the first book written about Pelosi, but it may be the best one, and in any case, it’s revealing. The big takeaway from Ball’s book is that Pelosi is an old-school operator. She accepts the constraints of the political machine and navigates it methodically. It’s a skillset that doesn’t always play well in the age of Twitter, but it works.",0

1451272791978770432,Nancy Pelosi is so vile in every capacity.,"You didn’t find Pelosi all that compelling when you started covering her a couple of years ago, but at some point you clearly changed your mind. Why?",0
1451272791978770432,Nancy Pelosi is so vile in every capacity.,"I think one of the things I came to understand about her is that she is a fascinating character who’s had a fascinating life, but she’s not necessarily a great teller of her own story. She’s not a natural storyteller. You think of great politicians as orators who are always speaking in pithy anecdotes and who talk about themselves in relatable and moving and empathetic ways. She has a lot of strengths as a politician, but I don’t think that’s one of them. But my view of her changed as I started to dive into her story.",0
1451272791978770432,Nancy Pelosi is so vile in every capacity.,"She’s been pretty widely caricatured, on both sides, and it’s hard to shake that perception.",0
1451272791978770432,Nancy Pelosi is so vile in every capacity.,"Right, and I think a lot of my book is about the role of perception in politics generally, but also specifically the way that she’s been perceived over the course of her career. And I think I, as much as anyone else, was susceptible to this sort of baked-in caricature of her as a rigid partisan without a lot of depth. And I guess I what I learned is that that caricature isn’t accurate.",0
1451272791978770432,Nancy Pelosi is so vile in every capacity.,Something that comes across really early in your book is that she likes to control things —,0
1451272791978770432,Nancy Pelosi is so vile in every capacity.,"Her staff will tell you that she line edits every press release that goes out and she’ll change a word here and there just so that it’s exactly right. Look, I don’t want to psychoanalyze her — I’m not qualified to do that. But what you see running through her life is this desire for control, whether it’s wanting to be able to control her own surroundings, her own situation, her own life.",0
1451272791978770432,Nancy Pelosi is so vile in every capacity.,Where does that come from?,0
1451272791978770432,Nancy Pelosi is so vile in every capacity.,"She was born into a situation where women didn’t have a lot of control over their own lives and seeing how her mother was never able to be independent and be in control of her own future. And so from an early age, she’s wanted to have control and I think that manifests itself all over the place.",0
1451272791978770432,Nancy Pelosi is so vile in every capacity.,"But look, there’s this interesting sort of paradox, where on the one hand she will tell you that she doesn’t care about her public image. On the other hand, I think she has become more aggressive about establishing her image and particularly what she sees as her strengths in recent years, because at some point she realized that her negative public image was interfering with her ability to achieve her goals.",0
1451272791978770432,Nancy Pelosi is so vile in every capacity.,A lot of that negativity has come from her own party —,0
1451272791978770432,Nancy Pelosi is so vile in every capacity.,"Oh yeah. In 2016 and 2018, there was a lot of angst in the Democratic caucus and an attempt to oust her as minority leader and then as speaker, just because she was viewed as such a toxic and polarizing figure. Even many Democrats had concluded that she was just a liability, that she was a burden simply because of the negative perceptions that had accrued over the years.",0
1451272791978770432,Nancy Pelosi is so vile in every capacity.,"Of course, her allies would say that’s because the Republicans created this impression of her with hundreds of millions of dollars of negative ads tying Democratic congressional candidates to this caricature of a “San Francisco liberal.” And it became this sort of vicious cycle where Democrats didn’t want to defend her because she was viewed as toxic and then the perception that even her own party didn’t support her increased the perception that she was toxic, and so it just fed itself in a loop.",0

1451272791978770432,Nancy Pelosi is so vile in every capacity.,Does Pelosi think of herself as a genuine progressive?,0
1451272791978770432,Nancy Pelosi is so vile in every capacity.,"I don’t know how she would answer that question, and I can’t speak for her, but I’ll say this: She was born into a Democratic political family in Baltimore, and I think her loyalty has always been to the party as an institution rather than to any movement or issue. So she’s not a progressive in the activist sense. During the Vietnam War, she was leafleting for Democratic candidates for president. In 1968, when there were riots outside the Democratic convention, she was inside the convention hall. So she’s always been part of the establishment in that sense.",0
1451272791978770432,Nancy Pelosi is so vile in every capacity.,"But she’s also a liberal. And she has been on the left edge of the party when it comes to things like gay rights and the environment and war. I mean, she didn’t just vote against the Iraq War, she voted against the Gulf War. She’s been on the left side of her party and pretty representative of her district in a lot of those ways.",0
1451272791978770432,Nancy Pelosi is so vile in every capacity.,"Now, I don’t think she considers herself a socialist. She certainly is not as far left as some on the left would like her to be, but on things like reproductive rights, she went against her church and her own party to be a consistent advocate for a woman’s right to choose. So I would place her on the left, but not on the far left.",0
1451272791978770432,Nancy Pelosi is so vile in every capacity.,What does she think of her critics on the left who say she’s a sellout or that she embodies everything that’s wrong with the Democratic establishment?,0
1451272791978770432,Nancy Pelosi is so vile in every capacity.,"She’s someone who very much sees politics as the art of the possible. And I think what she would say to anyone who’s got a cause or an issue or a movement that they’re passionate about is go out and do the work. Go build support out there among the public, go find votes here in the House of Representatives. The House Democratic Caucus is very ideologically diverse, and then they’ve got to deal with the Republicans. So you can be as far left as you want to be, but it’s not going to get you anywhere if you can’t find other people to build that movement with.",0
1451272791978770432,Nancy Pelosi is so vile in every capacity.,"So you saw last year when she had that high profile dust-up with the Squad over the border wall funding, and she made that dismissive comment that they’re four people and that’s all the votes they got. She was speaking quite literally. She was saying of all the Democrats in the House Democratic Caucus, only four of them thought that this particular bill didn’t go far enough. And this was the border funding supplemental that caused a lot of really nasty infighting among the Democrats in 2019.",0
1451272791978770432,Nancy Pelosi is so vile in every capacity.,"And so what she’s saying to them is, it’s great that a lot of people like you on Twitter, but if you can’t build a broader base of support, either out there among the public or internally in terms of votes in the House, you don’t really have anything.",0
1451272791978770432,Nancy Pelosi is so vile in every capacity.,"Now, I do say in the book that I think she’s somewhat dismissive of soft power and that maybe she’s too focused on hard power, but I think she came to this lesson very honestly. She learned earlier in life that people see you differently when you have the authority, when you have the votes. And that goes all the way back to the ’70s in San Francisco when she was appointed to the Library Commission. As a woman in 1975, nobody necessarily listened to her when she opened her mouth, but people had to listen to her when she had a vote.",0
1451272791978770432,Nancy Pelosi is so vile in every capacity.,Did you find her to be introspective at all about the mistakes she’s made as a leader of the party?,0
1451272791978770432,Nancy Pelosi is so vile in every capacity.,"She’s not a person who admits regret. She will not tell you that she regrets anything. She doesn’t do regret, and she doesn’t do fear. So you can ask her, “What are your greatest regrets in life?” And she’ll just say, “I don’t do that.”",0
1451272791978770432,Nancy Pelosi is so vile in every capacity.,"So you asked her that question, and she wouldn’t answer?",0
1451272791978770432,Nancy Pelosi is so vile in every capacity.,"But she has to have thought about the reality of Trump and how we got here as a country. That’s not to say that the Democratic Party is responsible for Trump — that’s absurd. But there’s no way to tell the story of this era without grappling with the failures of the Democratic Party and, for better or worse, she’s part of that.",0
1451272791978770432,Nancy Pelosi is so vile in every capacity.,"I tried to engage her in a conversation about what she thinks went wrong in 2016 and she doesn’t want to look back on it. There are a lot of explanations for what happened, and it’s really hard to sort out what’s wrong with a party that wins the popular vote. Because you can’t say, well, we turned the American public against us and our positions are all unpopular when your candidate wins the popular vote and there are a lot of other contingencies.",0
1451272791978770432,Nancy Pelosi is so vile in every capacity.,"She has said various times that she thinks there’s a lot of anger in the populace in large part due to worsening income inequality and to the hangover from the 2008 financial crisis, which she would’ve liked to have done more to address but couldn’t do it because of Republican opposition in Congress.",0
1451272791978770432,Nancy Pelosi is so vile in every capacity.,"The thing is, and you point this out in the book, you can look at Pelosi’s approach here and call it blind or a refusal to reflect on what’s gone wrong, but this is just her philosophy.",0
1451272791978770432,Nancy Pelosi is so vile in every capacity.,"Yeah, I think that’s right. Ultimately, she’s much more concerned with what she can do about something than with theories about why things are the way they are. A word that one of her mentors used for her was “operational.” She’s always focused on what she can do in a certain situation given the constraints she’s facing. That’s just how she approaches her job.",0
1451272791978770432,Nancy Pelosi is so vile in every capacity.,But she clearly has ideas about how to win in 2020 and beyond —,0
1451272791978770432,Nancy Pelosi is so vile in every capacity.,"I’ve talked to her quite a bit about how she thinks the Democrats should run in 2020 and what she thinks the elements of a successful campaign are. And you can see the seeds of a critique there of what she thinks Democrats were insufficiently focused on before. She was a big part of developing the Democrats’ strategy in 2018, and it was very much about ignoring Trump and staying focused on kitchen-table issues, particularly health care and economics. The message was, “We’re going to protect Medicare, we’re going to expand Medicare.” It was a very New Deal campaign message.",0
1451272791978770432,Nancy Pelosi is so vile in every capacity.,"She does not think that Democrats are going to win the Electoral College by campaigning on Medicare-for-all. And she says that when you say you’re going to take away people’s health care, even if it’s to give them something better in the long run, they view that as “menacing.” So she does believe that Democrats need to run to the middle if they’re going to win a national campaign and win the Electoral College.",0

1451272791978770432,Nancy Pelosi is so vile in every capacity.,"I think that there are certain values that she thinks are non-negotiable, like gay rights. She represented San Francisco in Congress in 1987 when the AIDS crisis was reaching its height and when a lot of politicians in both parties did not want to speak for that marginalized population, and she always saw that as her role. Now, she wasn’t in leadership at the time. She was representing her district, and that was very much a problem for her district and for her constituents, but she’s never wavered on her commitment to things like that. She was a big part of bringing the Democratic convention to San Francisco in 1984, and that was really the origin of the whole idea of “San Francisco liberals.”",0
1451272791978770432,Nancy Pelosi is so vile in every capacity.,"And she’s always viewed that as essentially a homophobic slur. She believes that when Republicans say “San Francisco Democrat,” what they’re saying is a dog whistle for gay rights.",0

1451272791978770432,Nancy Pelosi is so vile in every capacity.,"That’s her view of it. I mean, her line is, “If I weren’t effective, I wouldn’t be a target.” And I think there’s some truth to that. I think if she were as hapless as speaker of the House as some of her predecessors, she wouldn’t be such an obstacle to Republican policy goals. If it is true that without her, Obamacare wouldn’t have passed, well, then she’s the reason there’s this big, new program that spends a lot of money giving health care to poor people.",0
1451272791978770432,Nancy Pelosi is so vile in every capacity.,"So a lot of Republicans, particularly who are on the inside of the legislative process, have a sort of grudging respect for her because she’s good at her job and because she is a tough negotiator and because she’s always able to keep her caucus in line behind her.",0

1451272791978770432,Nancy Pelosi is so vile in every capacity.,I think it’s her historic accomplishment as the first woman speaker of the House — that’s a really big deal.

But there’s a reason she sticks around. Had Hillary Clinton won the 2016 election, she says, “we’d have a woman at the head of the table.” When that didn’t happen, Pelosi realized that without her, there might not be a woman in the room at all.",0
1451272791978770432,Nancy Pelosi is so vile in every capacity.,"Pelosi is one of the most consequential political figures of her generation. It was her creativity, stamina and willpower that drove the defining Democratic accomplishments of the past decade, from universal access to health coverage to saving the U.S. economy from collapse, from reforming Wall Street to allowing gay people to serve openly in the military. Her Republican successors’ ineptitude has thrown her skills into sharp relief. It’s not a stretch to say Pelosi is one of very few legislators in Washington who actually know what they’re doing.",0

Republicans see her as their biggest asset, and hope to motivate their voters in the midterm elections by putting her image in television ads. Meanwhile, despite the hundreds of millions of dollars she has raised for her party, nearly 60 Democratic House candidates have returned the favor by calling for new leadership. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s June 26 primary upset of one of Pelosi’s lieutenants, Representative Joe Crowley of New York, highlighted the restlessness of the party’s grassroots, and Pelosi’s erstwhile allies in the Congressional Black Caucus have pushed Representative James Clyburn to challenge her.

The only part that bothers her, she says, is when women who are thinking of running for office tell her they couldn’t withstand the abuse. “I say, ‘Forget what they’re doing to me, because you won’t be that much of a target. But you will be a target, because this is about power. And if you look like you’re making headway they will come after you. And it won’t be a pretty sight.'”",0
1451272791978770432,Nancy Pelosi is so vile in every capacity.,"The attacks on Pelosi are particularly ironic in this political moment. Since Donald Trump’s election, American women have poured into the streets, signed up to run for office in record numbers and surged to the polls. Many of them look a lot like Pelosi once did. They are brainy, liberal and comfortably situated moms who have looked at the political system with the exasperation of a person who has seen her husband get the laundry wrong and realized that she’s going to have to do it herself. If Democrats regain congressional power in November, as most experts expect, it will be by riding a tidal wave of female rage. But rather than tout their female leader–the first woman Speaker in history, and the odds-on favorite to reclaim the title–many Democratic politicians, both male and female, are running in the opposite direction. In this season of female political empowerment, Pelosi’s power still rankles.",0

Of course it does–a woman is always held responsible for her reputation. Clinton, in her years running for President, was asked over and over again some version of the question, Why do you think people don’t like you? (Despite not being on any ballot, Clinton, too, figures prominently in the Republicans’ fall campaign strategy.) A powerful woman is always defined less by what she has done than by how she makes people feel.",0
1451272791978770432,Nancy Pelosi is so vile in every capacity.,"Pelosi isn’t humble. Many women, she thinks, are afraid to show pride and need to see an example of confidence. Besides, making sure you get your due isn’t something you can delegate. One former Pelosi aide told me everything she does is rooted in this combination of obligation and entitlement: the sense that someone ought to do something, and she is the only one who can do it. Pelosi seems to feel no need to apologize for her status in the way women are expected to and men rarely are. Perhaps the assertion of ego by a woman is the most radical act there is: the refusal to submit or be subordinate.",0

She will be who she is–liberal, privileged, unpopular–and let the chips fall where they may. To some Democrats, Pelosi’s is an attitude of unconscionable selfishness: she’s willing to damage her party to hold on to the position she believes she deserves. The story of Nancy Pelosi is, inevitably, the story of what people think of her. The way she is recognized and remembered, the way she is held to account. And so Pelosi doesn’t have the luxury of not caring about what people think of her: it’s the question on which her future, and the future of American politics, depends.",0

This is not for the faint of heart.” It was typical Pelosi–a compliment, wrapped in an invitation to join the team, with just a hint of potential consequences. And it reflected a political education that, for Pelosi, began a lifetime ago.",0
1451272791978770432,Nancy Pelosi is so vile in every capacity.,"The youngest of seven children and the only girl, Pelosi grew up like royalty. Her father Thomas D’Alesandro Jr. was a member of Congress when she was born, in 1940, and the mayor of Baltimore by the time she was 7. When young Nancy wasn’t being ferried to a Catholic girls’ school, she was attending her father’s ceremonial events or helping him get out the vote. Her father’s ancestors had immigrated from Genoa, Venice and Abruzzo, her mother’s from the southern Italian city of Campobasso. The family lived in a three-story brick row house in the heart of Little Italy, a blue collar community near Baltimore’s industrial waterfront. The house appears vacant now; Pelosi points it out to me as we drive by. (We had planned to take a walking tour, but it’s a cold day, and she detests the cold.) A few blocks over, there are hipster restaurants and lofts, but in this part of town, the corners still feature traditional pasta houses.",0

His politics were about favor-trading and patronage, not grand ideological designs. (His aspirations to become governor were thwarted by a corruption scandal involving parking-garage construction, according to a 1954 TIME report.) Pelosi has a strong sense of ethnic identity–she credits her Italian heritage for her stamina–and as a leader she approaches the factions of the Democrats in a similar party-boss style. As her friend the late Congressman John Murtha used to say, “Don’t think she’s from San Francisco. She’s from Baltimore.”",0

While at Trinity College, a Catholic women’s school in D.C. now known as Trinity Washington University, she attended John F. Kennedy’s Inauguration and was swept off her feet. “Forget movie stars. We were all in love with JFK,” recalls Pelosi’s college friend Rita Meyer, one of a tight group of four girlfriends who remain close today.

Making a big pot of pasta?” she recalls him saying. (Pelosi is not much of a cook.) He offered her a spot on the city’s library commission and insisted that she take it. “I said, ‘I’m interested in the library, but I don’t need an appointment to the commission,'” she recalls. “And he said, ‘You shouldn’t say that. You’re doing the work; you should receive official recognition for it.'” That was a feminist lesson that stuck with her–a woman should get the credit she deserved–even if it was amusingly dissonant with the mayor’s assumption that she spent her days slaving over a stove.",0

She went on to chair the California Democratic Party and took a lead role in organizing the 1984 Democratic National Convention. She discovered a talent for assuaging the egos of powerful men even as she stood her ground against them. Yet she still envisioned herself as a helpmeet, a behind-the-scenes player. Then, in 1987, the San Francisco Congresswoman Sala Burton, who was dying of colon cancer, called Pelosi to her bedside and made her promise to run for the seat. When Burton died, Pelosi moved into an elegant house in the posh end of the district and entered a fractious 14-way Democratic primary.",0

She co-authored the bipartisan 1990 Ryan White Act, federally funding the treatment of low-income AIDS patients, which she muscled onto the national agenda and got a Republican President to sign. She was a supporter of gay marriage at a time when her party was pushing the Defense of Marriage Act.

Her own party put the legislation aside, but Pelosi kept at it, enlisting Republican allies, lobbying fellow members and offering policy concessions. In 1995, she managed to get a Republican Congress to create the nation’s most expensive national park–in the middle of San Francisco.

Pelosi’s House passed other priorities that died in the Senate, including a union-boosting measure and climate legislation. Her unruly caucus spanned the ideological spectrum, from Blue Dog conservatives to far-left ideologues, but Pelosi never lost a major vote. “I was in those rooms when people were saying, ‘Let’s just throw in the towel,’ and she’d say, ‘Give me the names and leave me alone for a minute,'” says George Miller, a retired California Congressman.",0

In 2016, 63 House Democrats–nearly one-third–voted against her for leader.

They just wanted change.",0

Crowley’s defeat inspired more infighting, with younger members such as Representative Seth Moulton of Massachusetts agitating for her ouster. Ocasio-Cortez, who hasn’t said whether she would support Pelosi, epitomizes the young, diverse, far-left grassroots Democrats who find Pelosi frustrating. In June, after Congresswoman Maxine Waters urged supporters to publicly confront members of the Trump Administration, Pelosi rebuked her, tweeting, “Trump’s daily lack of civility has provoked responses that are predictable but unacceptable.” The base erupted. The old, white establishment of the Democratic Party “just isn’t where the base is on how big a threat white supremacy is to the country,” says Sean McElwee, co-founder of Data for Progress, “vs. how big a threat being mean to Trump is.”",0

No one I spoke to expects she will lose a Speaker vote if Democrats take the House by a big margin. If they lose or win a slim majority, it could be a different story. Her grip on her caucus is principally due to her legislative skills and the favors she has accrued. But it’s also because there’s no obvious successor. Over the years, Pelosi has frozen out, stymied or simply outlasted younger members who seemed to pose threats, most of whom–Chris Van Hollen, Xavier Becerra, Israel–have given up and left the House. Crowley’s loss removed another potential threat, while also creating a vacancy in leadership. A competition for that position would take some heat off Pelosi. But the threat is real: under pressure from members, Pelosi in mid-July pushed back the party’s post-election leadership vote until after Thanksgiving.",0

And a lot of people find this kind of incestuous, but it is, for better or worse, a big way that that sort of gossip network that you describe is fueled. So that is all a little bit harder, to keep in touch with people and to sort of know what the scuttlebutt is. But also the kind of reporting I do - I'm not mainly a Capitol Hill correspondent.

She's from Baltimore. And that's both literally true and true in a deeper sense, right? Her father was a congressman from Baltimore and then became the mayor of Baltimore. He came out of the machine politics of Baltimore, a Democratic city. She was born in 1940, when her father was already in Congress. So literally from the day she was born, she was part of this very Catholic, very Democratic, very Italian family that was involved in the political life of the city and the nation.",0

And one of the things I tried to do in the book was sort of restore the significance of her mother to her life. You know, I think inevitably because her father was a politician, her mother sort of gets erased from this narrative, but she was very much shaped by her mother. And she talks very frankly, which I think is interesting, about how stifled her mother was. Her mother had a lot of ambitions that she wasn't able to fulfill simply because she was a woman. She wanted to be an auctioneer. She wanted to go to law school. She wanted to have her own business. And all of those dreams were thwarted because she had to stay home and raise the children and keep the house and because, quite frankly, her husband wouldn't let her.",0

But she needed her husband's signature in order to do that, and he wouldn't give it to her. So I think it shaped her that her mother was stifled in that way. But it also shaped her that her mother was a very strong and aggressive woman, a sort of - I don't want to be stereotypical, but, you know, the sort of fiery Italian American mother who - there are family stories about how she once punched a poll worker in the face. She was known to - she once put LBJ in his place and told off Ronald Reagan.

1451272791978770432,Nancy Pelosi is so vile in every capacity.,"BALL: She did. Her mother was responsible for a couple of things in the household as sort of the brains of the political operation. One was the Women's Democratic Club that operated out of the basement, and they did a lot of that hard work you're talking about - pounding the pavement, doing the precincts and making sure everything was in the right place. And then also the favor file, which is the other side of what you're talking about, the sort of constituent services operation, where there was a list that was maintained in the family's living room of all of the things - all the favors people needed from - whether it was their mayor or their congressman.",0

So she was a very active part of that operation from a pretty early age.",0
1451272791978770432,Nancy Pelosi is so vile in every capacity.,"And I think the point you make about how hard that work is is important because it's also very individual, right?

I think she viewed the leaders who'd come before her as being a little bit weak-willed and letting people get away with too much. And so at various points as minority leader before becoming speaker, a lot of what she was doing was trying to instill a sense of party discipline and wake up the Democratic caucus to the idea that they needed to work as a unit if they were going to have any kind of leverage in negotiations with the majority. And it is still, I think, the No. 1 thing that she says to and about her caucus today. She says, our diversity is our strength. Our unity is our power.",0
1451272791978770432,Nancy Pelosi is so vile in every capacity.,"DAVIES: And we got to work as a team. It really is interesting because when you're in the minority, you have to know how far you can push, right? I mean, and part of that involves knowing the circumstances in which the Republican leaders will need some Democratic votes because their own caucus was restive and some of them wouldn't go along with leadership. And so it's one thing to be tough and show steel, but to do it well, you really have to have done the homework and know exactly where you stand, where the votes are, right?",0
1451272791978770432,Nancy Pelosi is so vile in every capacity.,"BALL: That's right. And I think the other sort of favorite word in Nancy Pelosi's vocabulary is leverage. She always knows where those pressure points are, knows exactly what her leverage is. Sometimes it's that, as you say, the opposition is divided, and that means that if the Democrats are unified, they have a lot of leverage because the majority needs their votes. Another thing is just knowing what the priorities are. So in many of the negotiations with the Republican majority in the last few years, she knew that they wanted to increase military spending. So in order to get that, she was going to require them to increase some domestic spending or to protect some domestic spending that the Democrats cared about. So knowing those pressure points, knowing what it is your opponent values in the negotiation, enables her to to maximize that leverage.",0
1451272791978770432,Nancy Pelosi is so vile in every capacity.,"And then just the fact that she is so effective - it becomes a sort of virtuous cycle, I guess you would say, that because she's so successful at keeping the Democratic caucus united, it gives her a lot of credibility in that negotiation to say, I can bring along all of my votes. Can you do that? Because I haven't seen you do that, but you've seen me do that a lot.",0
1451272791978770432,Nancy Pelosi is so vile in every capacity.,"DAVIES: In 2006, the Democrats get the majority in Congress. She then becomes speaker the following January. And then in 2008, Barack Obama wins the White House. And Pelosi is speaker at a time when the Democrats control the White House and both houses of Congress. And you have a president with an ambitious policy agenda. And there were things they took on like the Affordable Care Act. But it's interesting that you write that one of the toughest things for her was dealing with President Obama. What was hard about that?",0
1451272791978770432,Nancy Pelosi is so vile in every capacity.,"BALL: I don't think she would say that he was hard to deal with. I think she - they - the two of them became very close. And she cherished that relationship very much. And I think he came to respect her as well. But this was a common refrain during the Obama administration from Democrats in the House and Senate. They just never felt that Obama was fully engaged with the Congress and knew his way around the Congress. Having only been a senator for a few years, never having been in the House and, you know, not being the sort of schmoozer who is always having people over to the White House and wining and dining representatives and so on, many of the House Democrats were often frustrated with President Obama's negotiating abilities, felt that he was giving away too much on the front end and wasn't maximizing leverage. So if you can imagine, if you're someone like Nancy Pelosi who values leverage, that's going to be extremely frustrating.",0
1451272791978770432,Nancy Pelosi is so vile in every capacity.,"DAVIES: Right. Well, and she was frustrated, as many in Congress were, that the Obama administration would want Congress to actually draft some of these really critical pieces of legislation, almost as if - I think you write - the Democrats in Congress felt that the Obama team wanted to get credit for these policy initiatives but not get their hands dirty in actually doing the work of making things happen. And then I guess the other thing was that Obama tended to think he was going to get Republican support. And she would tell him, no, they will string you along and then vote against you and then blame Democrats for everything that goes wrong.",0
1451272791978770432,Nancy Pelosi is so vile in every capacity.,"BALL: That's right. She had had a lot of experience watching how the Republicans did business and had become, I think, pretty appropriately cynical about their willingness to work in a bipartisan fashion. So pretty much from the beginning, you know, you mentioned that Obama came in with this ambitious policy agenda. He also, of course, came in with a crashing economy. And so the first order of business was to try to do something about that. And Obama really did think that because the situation was so dire and because he had run on this message of sort of uniting the country and because he came in with this very strong popularity, he thought that he could get some Republican support.",0
1451272791978770432,Nancy Pelosi is so vile in every capacity.,"But the Republicans pretty much decided at the outset that that was something they were not going to do. And Nancy Pelosi became a useful foil for them, in part because Obama was so popular, right? And they could always say, well, you know, we like Obama fine, but Nancy Pelosi and the Washington Democrats, they are the problem here. They're the ones getting in the way. They're the ones who won't work with us. And it wasn't true. She would've been willing to work across the aisle if she believed that they were really going to deal with her. But she also wasn't naive enough to think that they were totally sincere in all of their protestations.",0

1451272791978770432,Nancy Pelosi is so vile in every capacity.,"BALL: She was really instrumental to its passage, and I don't think that her role has been fully appreciated. A lot of the histories of the Affordable Care Act have centered on President Obama or have centered on the challenge of getting it through the Senate. But she was key to getting it through the House. And not only that - when the Democrats lost their 60-vote majority in the Senate and had to essentially start from scratch, there were a lot of people in the White House in the Obama administration who wanted to give up, who thought that this just wasn't going to be possible. It was too large a hill to climb, and it was looking politically toxic as well, and maybe they should toggle back their ambitions and try for something a little bit smaller, something that wouldn't be truly universal but would maybe just increase the number of children with health insurance. And Nancy Pelosi was the one who in that meeting turned to President Obama and said, Mr. President, I know there are people urging you to take what she called the namby-pamby approach, and she was the one who stiffened his spine. Now, the president and his people will tell you that he never went wobbly, although there's some evidence that perhaps he did, but she was the one who said, I will help you make this happen. Let's not back down. We've come too far. Trying to get some form of universal access to health care was something that the Democrats had been trying to do for the better part of a century, and they were so close, and she was not going to let him give up at that moment.",0

1451272791978770432,Nancy Pelosi is so vile in every capacity.,"BALL: Well, you have to remember that, first of all, nobody, including Donald Trump, expected him to win that election in 2016. So it was quite a jolt to everybody in politics, Nancy Pelosi included. And, also, nobody knew what to expect from him as president because he had said so many conflicting things in order to get elected, had had so many different personas from sort of conservative Republican to liberal New York Democrat.

She immediately started to think about, how can I deal with him? And they got on the phone, and he said some very nice things to her. And her very first thought, though, was, I have to protect the Affordable Care Act, because she knew that with Republicans, the only thing that had stopped Republicans from repealing the Affordable Care Act before was that President Obama would've vetoed it. But now that they had the majority in both houses of Congress and the presidency, it was a very real possibility.

Republicans have done a real good job of demagoguery where she is concerned and have made her the boogeyman for all conservatives to love to hate. If your a democrat or Liberal then chances are you like her or her policies. If your a conservative then just the opposite is probably true. I hope people don’t hate her personally as she appears to be a nice lady. Politics is a rough and tumble game and she understands this better than most.,1

1451272791978770432,Nancy Pelosi is so vile in every capacity.,Absolutely she should continue as Speaker. This isn't the equivalent of little league where everyone gets a turn. Nancy has kept the House focused and united in the face of the worst president and Senate ever. She has beaten Trump like he owed her money and raised multimillions for the party to fight in elections. She knows how to make the trains run on time and she has been critical to the opposition to the GOP. She clearly has another term in her.,0
1451272791978770432,Nancy Pelosi is so vile in every capacity.,"The Majority Party in the House of Representatives will select the Speaker of the House because the full House votes and a simple majority (50 % plus one) is all that is needed to carry the vote. Voting is done along party lines (Democrats and Republicans). Both Parties meet shortly after a new session of the Congress commences in January following the previous November’s Congressional election. The Democratic Caucus and the Republican Conference both meet among themselves to vote for Speaker (Majority Party) and the Minority Party will then select their Minority Leader who is considered a Speaker in waiting should that political party win the Majority of seats in the next Congressional election in two years. If a challenge is mounted to an incumbent speaker, said challenger has already been campaigning for that slot by working the phones and meeting with fellow members in the Caucus or Conference to line up support. Members know that if they mount a challenge and lose, there will most likely be pay back/retribution for mounting a challenge and losing which could include being stripped of a Committee Chair, Committee and Subcommittee assignments and even personally being shunned by fellow party members for doing this. 
Speaker Pelosi is very good at maintaining party loyalty and keeping unity among her Democratic Caucus. She is doing this a long time. By taking care of everyone in her party in the House by rewarding party loyalty with plum Committee assignments she helps to maintain her Speakership. Speaker O’Neill was also expert at this in the 1970’s and 1980’s. Speaker Rayburn also practiced this art to perfection from the 1940’s all the way to the early days of the JFK Presidency. Rayburn even coined the phrase “the way to get along is to go along” which meant make friends, not enemies and good things will happen personally and professionally. Speaker Pelosi is in the same class as both O’Neill and Rayburn. 
Will or should Speaker Pelosi seek another term as Speaker? My feeling is she definitely will and most likely will succeed once again. A new Biden Presidency will need an experienced Speaker shepherding Biden’s agenda items through the House successfully. Now, will the members of “The Squad” (whom I support wholeheartedly)pick one of their members, most likely the rising superstar Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and mount a challenge to Speaker Pelosi? Hard to say. My hunch is no because right now Party unity and undoing the severe damage of 45’s harebrained presidency will take precedence over personal ambition. For now.",0
1451272791978770432,Nancy Pelosi is so vile in every capacity.,"That is up to the Speaker and her fellow Democrats. I don't see anyone that can lead the reps through the next 2 years that is better qualified than she, assuming the Dems keep their House majority. If Trump wins, who do you think he would want to see as Speaker? Not Pelosi! Nancy Pelosi has more than earned her place at the head of the table. I would think that Biden knows that she will work tirelessly to push his agenda and to put the needs of the citizens of this country during this pandemic first. The Dems are notorious for shooting themselves in the foot---doing away with the 60 vote rule for SCOTUS confirmation---although that was the Senate--I would hope that the progressives have enough sense to understand that neither they, AOC or any other Dem, with the possible exception of Schumer is responsible for what they have been able to accomplish these last two years. The House of Representatives has been able to stand strong because Pelosi has shaped the opposition and when she stands strong she doesn't waver. She's not about to hug Lindsey Graham any more than bowing to Trump or Moscow Mitch. Whether Trump or Biden, Pelosi's place should be to the left of the President. At least with Biden she won't have to tear up an asinine speech.",0

Her predecessor, Phillip Burton, died in 1983 and was succeeded by his wife, Sala. A few short years later, Sala became ill with cancer and hand picked Pelosi as her designated successor, guaranteeing her the support of the Burtons' contacts. Then, Sala died just a month after being sworn in for a second full term. Pelosi went on to win the special election to succeed Sala, narrowly defeating Democratic San Francisco Supervisor Harry Britt, then easily defeating Republican candidate Harriet Ross on June 2, 1987. What a surprise! She hasn’t participated in candidates' debates since then because the election results are a foregone conclusion. The strongest challenge Pelosi has ever faced was in 2016, when Preston Picus polled 19.1% and Pelosi won with 80.9%.

She’s in her mansion, in front of her $20,000 refrigerator eating $12 a pint luxury ice cream telling a late night comedian that’s she’s surviving quarantine thanks to her ice cream. I personally don’t care if someone is rich, but please don’t lecture us about how awful Republicans are because they don’t care for the little guy! Then she got her panties in a wad over Trump stopping most travel from China and took to the streets of San Francisco calling him xenophobic and encouraged everyone to go to China Town and enjoy the celebrations and parades. Then she later blamed Trump for not taking the virus seriously. Oh, and who can forget the whole lot of them donning some sort of African scarf without really knowing what it stood for, and self righteously kneeling in Congress in honor of George Floyd, yet not one of them ever did diddly squat to pass prison reform or try to go into the poor communities to encourage economic growth ( unlike the Opportunity Zones that have begun to bring some life into these areas.) and her most recent antics were to keep a COVID relief bill from being passed until biden was supposedly elected. This came straight from her own mouth. She would include bail outs for largely Democrat States that had blown their budgets for years and need help from the Federal government ( COVID relief help for states was different). She preens in front of the cameras with her matching mask and insist that the other side hates science and kills people because of it while she goes to a hair salon and doesn’t wear her mask then has the gall to blame the salon owner. She waves her boney finger at us and reminds us that we should be grateful for her $600 stipend while attaching a multi billion dollar 5,000 page monster bill full of lobbyists wishes granted for stupid studies and foreign aid for unnecessary causes! The lists is long why she is so disliked. I find her to be a despicable and disgusting, hypocritical human being.",0

They know that their remarks are frivolous, open to challenge. But they are amusing themselves, for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly, since he believes in words. The anti-Semites have the right to play. They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert. If you press them too closely, they will abruptly fall silent, loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is past.

She has never had credibility with anyone outside the far-right, and never will, and she will never care — unless it becomes, by some unforeseeable peripety, expedient for her to undergo a sudden and profound change of heart. The commercial conditions that could eventuate in such a transformation are much to be hoped for: they would signal a real change in the climate of consciousness in America.",0

1451083769490722820,@newsmax Mitch McConnell is a sinister and cunning man.,"In the midst of this January’s historic, senselessly protracted government shutdown, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell decided it was time to put forward his vision of how government should properly function. So he took to the Washington Post op-ed section to deride a modest set of Democratic proposals to institute election and voting rights reform. Instead of doing the right thing and bowing to President Donald Trump’s demand for the partial funding for a wall along the country’s southern border with Mexico, McConnell complained, congressional Democrats were trying to game America’s electoral system to their own permanent advantage. McConnell’s litany of complaints spun off into labored assaults on proposals to reorganize the Federal Elections Commission (a bid to give “Washington a clearer view of whom to intimidate”) and to make Election Day a national holiday for federal workers, together with six days of paid leave for such employees to work in their local precincts to help get out the vote (or, in McConnell-ese, “extra taxpayer-funded vacation for bureaucrats to hover around while Americans cast their ballots”). For actually existing ordinary Americans—including the 800,000 or so federal employees plunged into desperate economic uncertainty by the shutdown—this was a singularly bizarre spectacle to behold: The man in Washington arguably most responsible for prolonging the ordeal of the shutdown was now pronouncing that an effort to enlarge the sphere of democratic participation was a venal, bureaucratic power grab, and a brazen affront to the sacred liberty of big-money political donors and their legislative mouthpieces.",0
1451083769490722820,@newsmax Mitch McConnell is a sinister and cunning man.,"What’s more, that’s just how Mitch McConnell wants it. Something of a journalistic cottage industry has sprung up around the recondite question of just what makes Mitch tick, but the uninspiring, mundane answer is hiding in plain sight. Mitch McConnell is the great avatar of the decades-long enclosure of our public life by money. He does not offer a stirring vision of conservative national greatness or even ends-justify-the-means rationales for Senate horse-trading that depart from the disheartening transactional version of our politics that reigns in the Citizens United age. In Mitchworld, you simply pay—and pay, and pay—to play. This brute fact accounts for a host of lesser paradoxes of McConnell’s career, beginning with this: The genuine tactical brilliance of his parliamentary career only gets appreciated by the loyal opposition of the left. Leftist critics of the plutocratic drift of conservative ideology—which is to say, American politics these days—appreciate the materialist candor of McConnell’s thug agenda in a way that the true-believing right never has. The fabled small-government, evangelical base of Republican national politics has always distrusted—and indeed, often hated​—Mitch McConnell. This was brought home to me forcefully at the 2016 Republican National Convention in Cleveland, as I watched, from the press seats, Reince Priebus introduce the Senate majority leader as the temporary chairman of the convention. From the floor, the boos outweighed the cheers. And the Mitch McConnell they were booing was pretty much peak Mitch McConnell. At that moment, he was in the middle of the greatest stand of his career: refusing to allow a Democratic president to fill a Supreme Court vacancy, based on an obscurantist reading of Senate appointment protocols that he was all but making up as he went along. The man nominated for the presidency at that convention would, with McConnell’s considerable help, go on to give the conservative movement a Supreme Court majority that looks poised to last a generation. Back in July 2016, that victory seemed exceedingly unlikely, hinging, as it did, on the election of a widely hated and transparently ridiculous man as president. But McConnell was the only person with the power and audacity to get any sort of court victory out of the last year of the Obama presidency. They still booed him.",0
1451083769490722820,@newsmax Mitch McConnell is a sinister and cunning man.,"But if they recognize that McConnell isn’t truly one of them, what is he? Political journalists have been asking versions of this question since basically the day he became the top Republican in the Senate despite a conspicuous lack of charisma, friends, or big ideas. The New York Times Magazine’s Charles Homans was the latest reporter to puzzle over the sphinxlike riddle of McConnell’s deeper motivations, in a lengthy profile published in January. The answer, as ever, is that McConnell is in every way a study in stolid depth-resistance. He’s basically just what he looks like: a man serenely unbothered by anything he’s done to get his power or anything he’s done with it, having few friends but many allies. Homans’s profile attempts to answer a question—can McConnell square his record with his apparent belief in himself as a man of principle?—that is only of interest if you genuinely care about whether he knows what a hypocritical bastard he is, or if you think someone asking him the right question can get him to care. McConnell is just what he looks like: a man serenely unbothered by anything he’s done to get his power or anything he’s done with it, having few friends but many allies. The piece mainly focuses on McConnell’s relationship to Donald Trump, which has been—yes—purely transactional and, to the disbelief of observers who assumed they’d clash, mutually beneficial in many respects. When Homans asks McConnell’s wife, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, whether Trump and McConnell like each other, he writes, “she was silent for a full four seconds before replying, ‘You’ll have to ask the president that, and you’ll have to ask the leader that.’” Asking someone who’s married to one of them and works for the other if they like each other does elicit a good chuckle, but it’s a strange question, really. Do they like each other? Does anyone like Mitch McConnell? As a means of unearthing character, such questions are what philosophers call a category error: To do his job, Mitch McConnell doesn’t need anyone to like him. He just needs enough money to keep winning elections. When magazine writers go for the McConnell profile, they usually run aground on the rocks of his complete non-presence. There’s not much in the way of illuminating personal anecdata in the man’s biography, so they cast him as the Master Dealmaker despite his lack of actual made deals—he tends to get a lot of credit for belatedly signing off on unsatisfactory ends to artificial crises that he, through inaction, allowed to fester—or the man beset by, and at the risk of losing his power to, an unwieldy new class of right-wing nuts (the Tea Party, and then Trump).",0
1451083769490722820,@newsmax Mitch McConnell is a sinister and cunning man.,"Except, of course, he has lived through this before. The best account of Mitch McConnell’s life and political career comes, unsurprisingly, from a representative of the avowedly (as opposed to accused) liberal media, the former New Republic reporter Alec MacGillis, whose aptly titled McConnell biography, The Cynic, was published in 2014. MacGillis writes that McConnell was a liberal Republican as a young man in the 1960s, when that was a perfectly normal thing to be. He was even pro-choice (which, again, would have been the natural position of any moderate, non-Catholic Republican at the time). Reagan, according to MacGillis, was McConnell’s fourth choice for the 1980 Republican nomination for president. But after Reagan’s victory, it became clear which side had won the internecine war over what the GOP was going to be from now on. So McConnell simply became a Reagan Republican. After his long career in the Senate, it may be impossible now to convince anyone he’s a Tea Party conservative or a MAGA Republican, but he’ll be perfectly comfortable working with members of both factions so long as they don’t harm his fundraising hauls or reelection chances. In the 2010 primary, Rand Paul defeated Kentucky Secretary of State Trey Grayson, McConnell’s handpicked successor to the state’s other U.S. Senate seat, running as an anti-establishment libertarian-ish maverick. McConnell shrugged, endorsed Paul, and participated in a make-believe talking filibuster he let Paul do as a favor. The junior senator has never given him any trouble; he’s become a reliable political ally, in fact. That’s the nice thing about defining your political project so narrowly: It makes it easy to get along with figures as diverse as Donald Trump and Susan Collins, each of whom only needs a little flattery now and then to believe McConnell’s on their side. Read enough about Mitch McConnell and you come to see him as a man of pure ambition and little else. But it’s ambition pointed in a strangely specific direction: the Senate itself. A recurring theme in McConnell profiles is someone close to him saying he never wanted to be president, but always dreamed of being the majority leader of the Senate. (The New York Times Magazine, 2019: “‘I think most senators look in the mirror and think they hear “Hail to the Chief” in the background,’ Terry Carmack, who has worked for McConnell on and off since his first Senate campaign, told me. ‘But he always wanted to be in the Senate.’” Politico Magazine, 2013: “‘Most politicians dream of being president,’ his former chief of staff Billy Piper told me. ‘McConnell dreams of being majority leader.’”) Even by the standards of other Washington creatures whose brains were poisoned by their weird ambitions, that is a weird ambition.",0
1451083769490722820,@newsmax Mitch McConnell is a sinister and cunning man.,"But once you realize McConnell has already achieved his life’s dream, and ascended to the limits of his ambition, his behavior suddenly starts to make more sense. He’s not trying to cap off his career with a legislative masterstroke, because he doesn’t care about legislation. He already won. He’s the Senate majority leader, his parliamentary prowess is regularly feted, and he has already left his legacy indelibly inscribed on the highest court in the land. Being a Senate majority leader who doesn’t care about almost any particular outcome to any particular political issue not directly related to making sure your funders can fund you actually seems to take quite a bit of pressure off, job performance–wise. Why go to bat to try to end a government shutdown when you don’t actually care if the government is shut down? Here’s Homans on McConnell’s answer to the question, “What do you see as your role, the majority leader’s role, in a time of crisis?” “Well,” McConnell replied, “I think what I have to do, my goal, and depending upon what the numbers are, and what’s achievable, is always to get as right-of-center an outcome as possible.” He brought up the example of the Budget Control Act of 2011, which we had been discussing: a bill produced from a high-stakes negotiation between the White House and congressional Republicans, in which McConnell, breaking with newly elected Tea Party hard-liners in the House, played dealmaker, providing the Democrats with bipartisan cover for a necessary debt-limit increase while also securing cuts that Republicans had sought. “I mean, at the risk of sounding like I’m patting myself on the back, who would have ever thought with Barack Obama in the White House you could get something like the Budget Control Act in August of 2011, which actually drove down government spending for two years in a row?” McConnell said. “To me, given the numbers, and if you prefer America right of center, that’s my definition of success.” I was startled not just by his frankness but by the type of crisis that McConnell’s mind had gone to, which was not exactly the kind of worst-case scenario that was foremost on many minds during Trump’s presidency. This is an extremely funny answer to anyone who remembers recent political history. The Budget Control Act of 2011 was a temporary compromise intended to use the threat of a future catastrophe to force a larger and more lasting compromise. Republicans in Congress had threatened to refuse to raise the debt ceiling—once more holding the basic operations of government hostage—unless the Obama administration acceded to their demands for economic austerity. At effectively the last moment before economic disaster, Republicans and the White House negotiated the Budget Control Act of 2011, which called for the creation of a bipartisan deficit-reduction “supercommittee” to propose a truly bipartisan austerity package within a few months. If Congress failed to pass it or a similar package, a series of automatic budget cuts would go into effect. These cuts were designed to be anathema to both parties—mostly because they would target defense spending, in addition to outlays for social spending and income supports. The entire point was that everyone would be incentivized to get a huge bipartisan deficit-reduction bill passed.",0
1451083769490722820,@newsmax Mitch McConnell is a sinister and cunning man.,"The supercommittee gave up after a few months and never sent anything to Congress. Congress delayed the punitive spending cuts for a while and then just let them go into effect. They are, in fact, still in effect—but now Congress votes every few years to temporarily cancel some of the automatic cuts to discretionary spending. In other words, all this high-stakes procedural confrontation simply produced another pointless artificial cliff. And far from achieving some golden-mean version of sober, fiscally restrained governance, it only increased the likelihood that the framework of budgeting-by-extortion would be used to extract demands from some future president or Congress—say, over a feckless plan to erect a wall to contain a nonexistent threat of rampaging immigrant criminality pouring across the Mexican border.",0
1451083769490722820,@newsmax Mitch McConnell is a sinister and cunning man.,"The fiscal cliff endgame was an outcome no one really wanted, which is what passes for “compromise” and “bipartisanship” in some segments of the political press. And while it did cut spending for a few years, it did so at the expense of something President Obama was, at various points in his presidency, practically desperate to sign into law with Republican support: a package of massive permanent spending cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and other programs. Republicans had a Democratic president who wanted to help them achieve one of their supposed signature policy goals, and they simply refused to allow him to do it. McConnell’s great victory was that he came in at the last minute to sign off on a deal designed to extort major policy outcomes that he and his party were solemnly pledged to support, but that his party then capsized out of pique and incompetence. McConnell has nearly all of his Republican colleagues beat: His moderation itself was cynical. But here we encounter another blank mystery for the oracles: Does Mitch McConnell really care if government spending rises or falls? Does he truly care if Social Security is privatized? His benefactors do, sure—and he cares about what they want for what are (yet again) painfully obvious reasons. But any issue without direct relevance to McConnell’s political fortunes is, for him, negotiable. Prior to the 2006 midterms, which were not looking good for the Republican Party, McConnell even advised President Bush to withdraw from Iraq to save the election. That’s how much he cares about the conservative project, as opposed to electoral success. The neocons wanted power in order to use it to shape the world. McConnell wanted to shape the world into one in which he continues to have power, and he did. Which is all to say, if he had doubts about Trump in 2016, they evaporated on election night, just as his doubts about his fourth-ranked presidential choice did back in 1980. In fact, it’s worth asking if we haven’t been thinking about McConnell’s political “evolution” all wrong from the beginning. Was he a liberal Republican—who still talks about witnessing Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s March on Washington as a young Senate intern—who cynically adapted to changing circumstances? Did he, like fellow pro-choice-Republican-turned-abortion-foe George H.W. Bush, sell out to win? Or was he just a Republican, period, who was a “liberal” one only because he then believed that was the most viable road to success in the party? He was strategically a Rockefeller Republican at a time when you could still make a bet that such socially moderate business types would survive the successive righteous onslaughts of the conservative movement. He has nearly all of his Republican colleagues beat: His moderation itself was cynical. If McConnell’s entire goal has been his political advancement within the Senate (which also requires supporting the Republican Party electorally by any means necessary), his career trajectory suddenly develops a tidy narrative throughline. He was a bit aimless in his early years in office, because he hadn’t arrived in the Senate with an ideological mission. He randomly threw his support behind an expensive health care plan and even backed federally subsidized family leave to fend off his first Democratic challenger for reelection. It was not quite the record of a future party leader.",0
1451083769490722820,@newsmax Mitch McConnell is a sinister and cunning man.,"But he was consistent—or rather, consistently inconsistent in one strategic direction—about one issue: campaign finance, on which he very quickly developed a reputation as an expert. He knew fundraising was his primary political strength and probably the only reason he was even in office to begin with. His problem was that, back in early 1990s, limiting money in politics was a popular and mostly bipartisan idea, and the main disagreements were about what kinds of money to restrict and how to do it. And over the years, McConnell shamelessly, fluidly recalibrated his arguments based on what was more useful to him, and then his party, at that moment. MacGillis patiently chronicles this process in his book: When McConnell felt he wasn’t getting enough support from PACs, he wanted PACs banned. When he thought Democrats were outperforming Republicans with “soft money”— contributions from corporations and unions to parties, not individual candidates— McConnell wanted soft money banned. By the end of the ’90s, when it was clear how much Republicans were benefiting from soft money, he was vociferously defending it from the attacks of his Republican Senate colleague John McCain, who’d made it his mission to rein in political spending. For years, McConnell argued for disclosure of donors instead of spending restrictions. By the 2010s, when Democrats were pushing exactly that position to curb some of the deregulatory excesses of the Citizens United ruling—which represents the closest thing you’ll find to a lodestar for McConnell’s belief system—the Senate leader of course reversed himself yet again. He also made an important rhetorical shift, one that tracked closely with his second great political crusade: enabling the slow but implacable death march of right-wing jurisprudence. Early on in McConnell’s career, he mainly made his case for opposing campaign spending restrictions in pragmatic terms. But in 1995, he reversed his position on a flag-burning ban in order, critics charge, to more credibly pursue his new campaign of pushing all political spending as First Amendment–​protected speech, aligning him with the conservative legal movement. (It may seem silly, but coming up with a principles-based reason for a decision that will have a politically or materially beneficial outcome for you or your side is a cornerstone of conservative legal theory.)",0
1451083769490722820,@newsmax Mitch McConnell is a sinister and cunning man.,"The most powerful Senate majority leader over the past decade is an errand boy for both an errant billionaire class of campaign donors, and an errant billionaire president. It’s also worth noting, as one wades through the brackish capitulations to plutocratic power that Mitch McConnell has always loudly and forcefully embraced as a vindication of his first principles, that his is a case in which the personal is very much political. When you spend so much of your time asking rich people for money, it does help to have a lot of it yourself, so you have something in common. Curiously, McConnell’s own personal fortunes are frequently left out of his profiles, perhaps because it appears vaguely unseemly for reporters or editors to just come out and say the plain truth: He married into money, which had enormous political benefits. This is not to make any unsavory insinuation about the nature of his relationship with Elaine Chao—it is, however, to note that she was a wealthy shipping heiress when they married, and he was effectively a lifelong politician who’d barely sniffed the private sector. Even before the marriage, Chao’s wealthy father had been a large Mitch McConnell donor; after, he became an even more enthusiastic one. He also gave the couple at least one reported gift of millions of dollars. In 2016, Mitch McConnell was estimated to be worth around $27 million. McConnell knew first that unlimited fundraising was the key to his own political fortunes. He came to realize it was the best way for the Republicans to keep their power too, as unions declined and corporate power, along with income inequality, rose and rose. Republicans have a built-in advantage in a world of unlimited political spending. It took McConnell’s forceful arguments with people like John McCain to get them all to come around to his way of thinking. McConnell spent most of his career scheming to become the top Republican in the Senate, so it must have been a profound disappointment that he was not able to do so until 2007, by which time the Bush administration had so destroyed the reputation of the Republican Party that it had lost both houses of Congress. McConnell’s Senate colleagues elected him minority leader in a blaze of powerless compromise. The remaining moderates thought they had chosen someone who’d have their back as the party continued to lurch rightward. He absolutely would do anything to help any Republican senator keep their seat—he tossed a couple of million dollars for infrastructure to Rhode Island to aid liberal GOP incumbent Lincoln Chafee’s doomed reelection bid—and he did exert some effort to keep the most extreme candidates from winning primaries (for electoral, not ideological, reasons). But if the GOP was trending wingnut and kept winning elections, McConnell would go along with that plan just as readily. (Chafee, for his part, mounted a brief run at the presidency in 2016—as a Democrat.) This is where the story of how Mitch McConnell saved the GOP begins. The infamous strategy that McConnell dreamed up and put into action to throttle any putative accomplishment of the Obama White House, no matter how nugatory, has become the stuff of right-wing parliamentary lore. We know the quote about his main priority being to make Obama a one-term president. It’s easy to forget now, though, the long odds he faced.",0
1451083769490722820,@newsmax Mitch McConnell is a sinister and cunning man.,"The GOP after Bush should have been finished for a generation. It was utterly defeated, and a Democratic president had just been elected—via the Democrats’ fourth popular vote victory of the last five presidential elections—in a near-​landslide. Massive Democratic majorities were installed in both houses, and the Senate Democratic caucus flirted with the true golden ring of power: an actual filibuster-proof majority. The economy was in ruins, and everyone knew who was to blame for that: Republicans. The signature policy of the Bush administration, the Iraq War, was acknowledged by all to be a catastrophic failure. The situation looked about as bad for Republicans as it had on FDR’s inauguration day. But they surged back into power almost immediately. There are a lot of interconnected reasons for this, including but not restricted to: Barack Obama’s early decision to move on from further investigation (let alone prosecution) of Bush administration officials; political choices made to prioritize stabilizing Wall Street over providing relief to homeowners; and the Democratic Party’s long-term inability or unwillingness to treat the Republican Party as an extreme and malign force that must be defeated, instead of negotiated with. And McConnell can’t take credit for personally creating the conditions that led to the plainly racist national backlash against the first black president (he has a few generations of predecessors in his party and the conservative movement to thank for that). But he does deserve the credit he has received for ruining the honeymoon: for taking a moment of national inspiration and almost immediately souring it. In 2009, Republican senators, like most senators in the old days, were still driven to cut deals and negotiate compromises to make themselves feel important. Democrats hungered to give them opportunities to have input into major legislation. “I was determined to demonstrate how the Senate could still work,” MacGillis quotes Connecticut Democrat Chris Dodd saying, after he duly sought Republican participation in the effort to craft a financial regulation bill. Of course, McConnell had to prove the opposite. And McConnell, as a political nihilist, always has an advantage over people determined to prove things work: It’s much easier to simply make things not work, if the only outcome you care about is electoral. So Republicans in Congress painstakingly drew out the negotiations over the Obama agenda while stigmatizing the results as rank political perfidy. They created and stoked, via the Koch-funded antics of the Tea Party, a national backlash against the Affordable Care Act. And against all odds, Republicans managed to take back the House two years into Obama’s presidency. Even so, the 2012 presidential election was another wake-up call: Americans still mostly hated Republicans and their ideas and their politicians. Some Republicans understood this and began circulating memos calling for the party to find ways to appeal to young people, Latino voters, and moderates. Others started laying the groundwork for a full-on revival of Pat Buchanan’s herrenvolk brand of white populism.",0
1451083769490722820,@newsmax Mitch McConnell is a sinister and cunning man.,"McConnell just kept things moving slowly, waiting to see. He’d finally win majority leader after Republicans again did well in the 2014 midterms, knocking out Democratic incumbents mostly in “presidential” red states—not enough angry white men to win a national election, maybe, but more than enough to win a healthy Senate majority. And that majority, under McConnell’s gleefully nihilist direction, would grind the judicial nomination process almost to a halt. Donald Trump would enter the presidency with 88 district and 17 court of appeals vacancies to fill, along with a Supreme Court vacancy improbably procured and kept open by McConnell’s obstructionist absolutism. A seemingly bulletproof Republican Senate majority stood by, eager to seat the furthest-right nominees to all these judicial seats that they could find. Not even Mitch McConnell originally thought Trump would get that chance, of course. Like everyone else, he viewed Trump’s seizure of the nomination as a worst-case scenario for the GOP. But as he always does when the GOP is self-destructing, he mainly kept quiet. Behind the scenes, of course, he did two key things to help: First, for old time’s sake, he refused to let Obama have one last moment of bipartisanship, when the president asked him and House Speaker Paul Ryan to call out Russian interference in the 2016 elections, according to former Vice President Joe Biden. Even that was another campaign finance story. Leonard Blavatnik is a Russian-American dual citizen who made his fortune in postcommunist Russia. He had a history of donating modest sums to candidates from both parties until he became, suddenly, an extraordinarily generous supporter of Mitch McConnell’s political machine in 2015, The Dallas Morning News reported. From 2015 to 2017, Blavatnik steered $3.5 million to McConnell’s PAC. An offshore holding company co-owned by Blavatnik and billionaire Viktor Vekselberg owns 26.5 percent of Rusal, the aluminum giant controlled by oligarch Oleg Deripaska, who is regularly said to be the lobbying client most responsible for Paul Manafort getting in trouble. McConnell was first briefed about Russian attempts to sabotage or interfere with the presidential election in September 2016. In October, his PAC accepted another $1 million from Blavatnik. The total haul was only made possible by the campaign finance system created not by some Senate majority, but by our conservative Supreme Court in its landmark 2010 Citizens United ruling.

1451083769490722820,@newsmax Mitch McConnell is a sinister and cunning man.,"“Well, I mean, the ultimate check against any of this is the ballot box,” McConnell replied. “And one could argue, at least with regard to the House of Representatives last year, that there were plenty of people who wanted a midcourse correction.” McConnell said those words as the majority leader of a deeply and intentionally undemocratic institution that exists to dilute the political power of citizens in larger and more diverse states. He said them about a president who was elected despite receiving fewer votes than his opponent, thanks to the counter-majoritarian workings of another antiquated and intentionally undemocratic institution that he, obviously, would fight any effort to reform. And, of course, he says this as a man whose political project is increasingly about reducing the power of the ballot box as much as possible—a man who breaks any and all decorous governing traditions in his path in order to confirm judges who strike down voting rights laws, and who, during government shutdowns that he has the power to end, sits down to write op-eds bemoaning attempts to make Election Day a holiday. McConnell has built a GOP machine that is as immune as it can be to the ballot box, because he is smart enough to know that Republicans cannot, as currently constituted, win fair elections often enough to retain power. But by choosing incredibly canny battles—his relentless attempts to first upend even the possibility of campaign finance regulation and enforcement, and then to pack the judiciary with right-wing ideologues—McConnell has enabled the conservative movement to dominate American politics long after its tenets are fully rejected by the majority of the electorate. All that time with McConnell did give Homans one special insight: McConnell hasn’t just “broken” the Senate by smashing its norms, or by making it dysfunctional. He’s essentially worked to make it irrelevant. For the foreseeable future, America’s regulatory policy will be written by the judiciary. Its ability to prosecute white-collar crime and bribery, to levy taxes, and create social welfare programs—all of these powers will be stripped from the Senate and put in the hands of the men (it’s almost all men) McConnell has placed on the courts. But he’ll probably go to his grave chuckling that Harry Reid started it, and get his name on that damn building too. America doesn’t really remember why it hated its political villains for very long, especially when they win.",0

The dictator behind the scenes, he is the all powerful leader of the entire greedy, bigoted, hate fueled , Republican party. I believe he is almost a traiter to this democracy, undermining and weakening the integrity ofF America's character in this country and worse in the eyes of the world. Our good name is part of our power. Mitch shows the world and Americans that winning is more.important than doing the right thing. As an elected official I believe it is his duty to serve the people to do what's right and best for them, and as Majority leader he does have the responsibility to lead a government which projects the American values of justice, fairness, honesty, truth and can-do attitude. These values are what make us the most powerful nation in the world. The reasons other counties look up to us, believe in us and want to emulate us. Mr. McConnell has shamed us using his stunts like not calling witnesses to Senate impeachment letting Trump get away with the crap he pulled., a truly dark episode in our history. Ordering fellow Republicans to vote as he dictates or be prepared for the consequences. NOT DEMOCRATIC. Refusing to vote at all if he rejects the issue. NO. I know what he does and I know it's not right. Unfortunately as the rest of the world watches they also see we are not governing with the heart of our sacred Constitution . Our internal conflicts and McConnels us against them, win fair or not way is not the American way. McConnells “Do (vote) as I say or risk your position, your career, your good name and get berated or shunned by your peers is the McConnell way of rule. McConnell denied Obama his rightful appointment of a Superior Court Justice, spouted some bologna reason he himself made up to change the rules, ordered his minions to reject ANY appointee Obama selected then blatantly changed the rules again 4 years later ordering a quick vote to let Trump appoint a justice. Not just a hipocrate but I believe THAT is almost a criminal abuse of power. McConnell's disregard of dispicable behavior, condoning a bully, and manipulation of rules and law are threats to life liberty and the persuit of happiness.

He restricts abortion access (which I agree that abortion is morally wrong) but turns a blind eye to foreign and domestic human rights abuses (Uighur genocide, Rohingya cleansing, U.S. southern border situation). He falsely associates the expansion of the welfare state in the late 70s and early 80s with the socioeconomic disenfranchisement of black and brown communities (c.c. the Iran-Contra Affair, which introduced the drug trade into U.S. urban areas; it was transparently the responsibility of the Reagan administration and was swept under the rug by Bill Barr under Bush 41).

If it was Pierre Trudeau, he would have countered with the fact that “ranked voting” does favour the electorate’s second choice, and if your party has no chance of being the second choice of the electorate, there may be something wrong with your party’s ideology and platform.

In good economic times the government should balance the budget, eliminate the deficit and pay down the national debt so that when the inevitable hard times come there will be gas in the economic tank. Instead, Trudeau and company spent money like drunken sailors and ran up the debt to historic levels, and what do we have to show for it? Do our indigenous peoples have clean water and better living conditions as promised? Is there a comprehensive infrastructure program to update our aging cities? Did the federal government increase health payments to the provinces? Is the Canadian military any closer to replacing their aging clapped out equipment? Is there a comprehensive plan for moving forward on climate change, global warming and renewable energy? The ball was dropped horribly on the Meng Wanzhou file and now we have Canadians imprisoned in China and farmers without markets for their crops thanks to Chinese retaliation. Almost from the git go thanks to the Phoenix pay disaster Trudeau can’t even pay the civil servants properly, and every attempt to fix that ends up worse than the one before (as a retired federal government senior IT manager I really can’t believe the continued ineptitude on this), the government is months and months behind paying benefits to Canada’s veterans, the list goes on and on and on.

At times it’s utterly embarrasing - like on his “business” trip to India where even the Indian media were teasing about his unnecessary, super stereotypical Bollywood style, posing as if in prayer by the Taj Mahal, etc. It’s not only misinformed, but the point is to create trade ties, not to show off how “culturally sensitive” you think you are. It’s embarrassing. Not to mention the whole debacle where he ended up inviting a CONVICTED TERRORIST to a political dinner. Good times.
 * his questionable extreme left leanings. Honestly this should worry nearly everyone on the political spectrum. He spoke glowingly of Fidel Castro, and has mentioned that he wishes Canada’s government were more like China’s - where they get things done instead of debating things. How lovely.
 * You see that authoritarian, dictatorial streak in how he approaches people who disagree with him, too. He banned members of his own party from being pro-life, for example, only giving leniency to sitting MPs. Any future MPs need to toe the party line on that one, despite it being a contentious moral issue that crosses political parties (obviously, Liberal voters had voted in several Liberal, pro-life MPs, so why muzzle them if that’s what voters want?). Or, for example, he was all about electoral reform (the sole reason I voted Liberal last election) - but he first tried to stack the review committee with Liberals, and pulled the whole project when it was looking like the system he favoured was not the one people would prefer to go with. Then there’s the whole issue with the summer jobs funding “values statement” that actually blew up even on an international scale. Hell, I saw the *Toronto Star* - ie. possibly the most left-leaning mainstream paper I’ve read - throw in phrases like ‘all hail the Emperor’ cos it was such a heavy-handed, morally authoritarian move.
 * He’s been found in breach of ethics regulations like, what, 4 times now? And each time he manages to dodge any kind of consequences. Now he’s embroiled in that whole, highly suspect SNC-Lavalin garbage. No surprise there. He’s shown how corrupt he is often enough that I think no excuses can be made for him - especially in light of that dictatorial streak.
 * There’s also the oilsands issues… don’t get me wrong, I’m all for working on improving access to and production of clean energy. I really do think it’s the way forward. But the fact is that he basically all but shut down the oilsands, very quickly, by implementing very restrictive production guidelines and killing things like new pipeline projects to move the oil (while also, weirdly, spending tons of money on *old* pipelines). It’s causing thousands of job losses in a sector that, iirc, makes up like 20% of Alberta’s economy, with *absolutely no* alternatives for people, *while* still importing oil from other countries that is not subject to those same restrictions. THEN he insults oilfield workers by suggesting that they’re dangerous to the rural communities they work and live close to…. I mean, it’s just stupid. Yeah change needs to happen, but it has to be planned, & there have to be viable alternatives to the thing you want to get rid of. Seriously I think he’s just winging it sometimes.
 * the carbon taxes he’s forcing through - a lot of lower & middle class people are struggling to make ends meet, and what does he do? Tax fuel in a country that’s insanely sprawled out, where winter is like half of the year in most places. It’s not like he’s done anything to build clean, viable alternatives to energy, so this just amounts to yet another tax on people who are already stretched thin.
 * And who can forget the obvious virtue-signalling? Peoplekind, anyone? Feminist budgets? Spending millions on a statue to gay people while telling struggling veterans that they’re asking for too much? Telling people with legitimate questions about the cost of illegal immigration that they’re racist? Issuing a “welcome to Canada” tweet for people illegally in the US to exploit a border law loophole, sending “irregular” immigration through the roof with no ways of dealing with it effectively? Promising to donate millions of dollars to a charity over Twitter with no governmental consultation, as if it were his own personal money he were spending? I suppose this ties into the “image over substance” stuff but it bears mentioning all on its own.
The only things I think he did right so far was not 100% caving to Trump, and legalizing pot. Everything else, he’s just ridiculous, short-sighted, and frankly harmful to Canada.",0

The Saudi Arms Deal - he supported our previous Prime Minister negotiating a $15 billion arms deal with Saudi Arabia. Since Trudeau took office Saudi Arabia’s war in Yemen has turned genocidal, and Trudeau continued to sign export permits for the deal in spite of objections.
2. He’s a phony feminist/LGBTQ+ advocate. Saudi Arabia uses other Canadian weapons to hunt down and arrest women who were themselves sexually assaulted. They use our weapons to kill homosexuals. It’s like the police showed up at the Orlando Night Club shooting and took the shooter’s side - worst gun control policy ever.
3. He can’t balance the budget. We now have $70 billion in deficit spending, at a time of rising interest rates. If interest rates hit the level as of the year of my birth, the Canadian federal treasury will be empty, and we won’t be able to afford things like our military, social transfers, or health care. We would be in a situation worse than Greece is now, where homelessness is sadly common.
4. As a tax consultant I find him highly dishonest. He claims he’s lowered taxes for middle class Canadians. While he did lower the rate by 1.5% for people earning ~$40,000-~$90,000, he also eliminated or reduced multiple tax credits (Children’s fitness/arts credit, income splitting, public transit credit, TFSA etc.). This means taxes went up for people earning less than $40,000, and for those earning $50,000, they get a $150 tax break, and have lost all those credits. Most studies have suggested the average Canadian is paying around $800 on average more in taxes (depending on which credits they used). Trudeau either knows his claims about lowering taxes are untrue, or he is doesn’t - he’s either lying or ignorant, in any event, he’s not fit to be making decisions on our tax code.
5. His high government spending has caused a massive spike in our cost of living. As an investor, the metric I use suggests it’s gone up by 14% since he took office. Which means, someone earning $50,000 still earns that number on their salary, but the $50,000 only purchases what $43,000 would purchase when he took office.
6. He’s a fake environmentalist - he gives $3.3 billion in subsidies to fossil fuel companies and only $450 million (on average) each year. Also, I did 117% on green tech investing in 2017, I can assure you there’s no one in Trudeau’s cabinet capable of identifying residual cashflows in a green tech company, he doesn’t know which ones to invest in but he throws money at it anyways. He’s also cancelled environmentally-friendly tax breaks like the public transit credit.He should have added deductions like a write-offs for interest on mortgages that buy green energy in houses, or interest on autoloans for electric cars, Rather than allowing Canadians to decide how to go green, he’s been arrogant and believes himself capable of figuring it out for us when there’s nothing in his government’s resume that suggest they can.
7. He’s bought and sold by lobbyists, like SNC Lavalin.
8. He’s a hothead. He yells at people when he doesn’t get his way. Women in parliament have accused him of yelling at them. He manhandled an MP for not starting a parliamentary session on time, bumping into women along the way.
9. He’s allowed members of ISIS to re-enter the country.
10. He’s unintelligent. When asked questions that he doesn’t have a scripted answer for, he stumbles miserably over his words and can’t give straight answers. He makes outrageous claims like lower-middle class Canadians don’t pay taxes. He applies his scripted answers even when they don’t make any sense. It’s almost as if his only training is as a drama teacher, where he can memorize lines but can’t say anything beyond that. He doesn’t know anything about economics, but he’s capable of learning lines about economics that 39% of voting Canadians will like. He says things like, “Stephen Harper has the worst economic record of any Canadian Prime Minister since RB Bennett”, which ignores that Harper dealt with the worst global financial crisis since the 1930s - when RB Bennett was Prime Minister; while I didn’t vote for Harper this shows Trudeau either doesn’t understand economics or he’s willing to lie about its causes to win elections.

12. Forces a carbon tax on every province that refuses to implement the tax. Going so far that the provinces are now pushing back through the courts in their refusal to implement.
13. His interference with local police investigations. Just like Obama mouthing off when some black guy got killed (it was found out later that the scenario was false), Trudeau mouthed off when some muslim kid said that she was attacked on the street on the way to school. Turns out, she lied, cops had it figured out within a couple of days.
14. All about environmentalism, yet has no problems taking a private jet back to Canada, then back to Florida within a 24 hour period…generating enough CO2 for an entire family for a year.
15. Taxing the hell out of the middle class, and small and medium sized businesses, but if you’re worth $100m or more (or your business is), then he gives you lots of breaks and deductions so you can hide your money and avoid the taxes. Morneau made changes to the tax code regarding pension funds…changes which made Morneau’s company millions because they were well situated to take advantage of pension fund managers. But those changes also made it possible for Sears Canada to screw their employees out of their pensions when the company closed its doors, moving all their money to the States.

Sir McKenzie Bowell - Dec. 1894 to Apr. 1896. Bowell became Prime Minister by default when two people died and one person had to quit due to bad health starting in 1891. Bowell, the only Prime Minister to serve from the Senate, was chosen because he was senior in cabinet. He screwed up every major challenge that came his way (most notably the question about Manitoba’s Catholic school system) and eventually his own cabinet stopped inviting him to meetings. Charles Tupper was chosen by the party to lead them into the 1896 election.
2. Sir Charles Tupper - May to July 1896. Serving for just two months, he had the shortest time in office of any Prime Minister to date.
3. Arthur Meighen - July 1920 to December 1921 and June to September 1926. Canada’s Winston Churchill. Brilliant. Ambitious. However, universally hated by Canadians and totally incompetent at keeping power. Lost his first election by a wide margin. Couldn’t win a majority his second time out and couldn’t keep power for more than three months once he tried to form a government. Tried to make a comeback in the 1930s, but couldn’t even win his own seat.
4. Joe Clark - June 1979 to March 1980. Won the Conservative party’s first election since 1958 with a slim minority and decided to push a non-confidence vote. He lost it.
5. John Turner - June 1984 to September 1984. His most notable accomplishment in office was appointing party members to lifetime patronage appointments, which cost him the next two elections.
6. Kim Campbell - June 1993 to November 1993. To be fair, the Conservative Party had already been fractured by Brian Mulroney, but she took the party from over 150 seats in parliament to two, even losing her own. Canada’s first female prime minister hasn’t been followed by another in 28 years.
7. Paul Martin - 2003–2006. Took a party that had won three straight majority governments (first time in history) and reduced it to a weak third place by the time he left. Pursued austerity policies that crippled the Canadian economy. Laid the groundwork for Stephen Harper’s ten year rule.

Justin Trudeau is a puppet of the hard Leftist executive board of the Liberal Party of Canada, trading on the surname of his putative father, Pierre. Justin Trudeau takes advice from Gerald Butts, his clooose buddy since university days.
2. Justin is a dilettente, never having finished a university course of studies. His “teaching experience” was as a “substitute teacher”, with the complimentary temporary licence granted him by the Government of B.C. He is a playboy who likes to drink wine, party, wear bespoke clothing, and has a sock-fetish.
3. Justin is very appreciative of the Chinese Communist Party and was a good friend and accolyte of Cuban dictator Fidel Castro, whom Justin very closely resembles, and should submit to a public DNA test to prove his lineage. He does not resemble Pierre Trudeau. Justin is a communist in everything but name, and his politics appear to bear this out. He is anti-democratic, unless it suits him.
4. Justin is becoming a Dictator of Canada, almost on the verge of declaring the Emergency Act (the former “War Measures Act”.
5. Justin’s mother, Margaret, is a schizophrenic of the “bi-polar” variety. There is a very good likelihood that those same genes and DNA occupy Justin’s brain as well. His shilly-shallying and bullying in politics, and his penchant for hiding and acting (with a soft, lisping, quasi-hypnotic, calculatedly “calm” voice and over-enunciated speech pattern) supports suspicion that he is a narcissist and a manipulator.
6. Justin is also an unconvicted crook with regard to the hushed-up SNC Lavalin scandal, for which he should be convicted and jailed — but the RCMP is in his pocket, along with the Pravda/Isvestia style favouritism that he promotes in the Mainstream Media, by bribing them with “grants” as “favoured journalists” who will NOT present any negative news concerning the Libs or Trudeau.
7. Aside from all the above, he looks like a light-in-the-heels Marseilles gangster.
8. He cashiered Jody Wilson-Rabauld when she wouldn’t do his bidding to change her mind about the need to bring Quebec company SNC Lavalin to account in court. Why? To curry more favour with Quebeckers and the French “money moguls” of Quebec, many of whom are just Franco-hogs at the Federal trough — even though Quebec has NEVER SIGNED the Constitution Act of 1982, and technically should NOT be allowed to participate in any Canadian legal/constitutional/foreign dealings and determinations.
9. I don’t *HATE* Trudeau, but I do wish that God Almighty would arrange his political downfall and the utter decimation of Liberal Party of Canada prestige and power in Canada. The Liberal Party assumes that it is the “natural governing party”; it is time to dissolve these derriere-kissing hacks, as the Americans once did with their pre-Republican “Whig” Party. Corruption all the way.

There's a cheap paper mask of Pelosi's face mashed on the mug of what appears to be a college student. The outfit, a knockoff, is stippled in dime-store blood. From her fingertips, this ghoul Pelosi dangles long strings of fake-blood-smeared dolls meant to represent fetuses. So it's a leftover ghoul, anachronistically summoned from some forgotten pro-life rally, here to remind anyone who passes that many lawn ghouls agree that Nancy Pelosi must answer for her sins — even if the Speaker is, at that very moment, announcing a plan to get health insurance for the little whelp behind the mask until she is twenty-seven years old. Next to her stands old-white-man ghoul, shambling and disheveled, holding up a placard that reads Kill the Bill. He too wears a mask you're supposed to recognize, but that doesn't stop a nearby cop from asking for a trick-or-treat clarification: Who are you supposed to be? Meet the ghoul Harry Reid.

Pelosi wrestled that one for her own simply by executing her duties — two escalating briar-patch wars, one caterwauling economy, and all those thick and meaty state-by-state unemployment numbers aside. With the midterm elections ten months away, you can mark it down: Nancy Pelosi is winning. Not hearts and minds — those she leaves to Obama; they are his to lose.

Most people say they've never seen her eat anything else. Congressmen. Reporters. Waiters. They all say it. There are broad allusions to her vanity — that she won't leave her office till her looks are just right — and her weakness for celebrity — that any celebrity who traipses onto the Hill, from Bono to Brad Pitt, must make a photo stop.

He came out of the machine politics of Baltimore, a Democratic city. She was born in 1940, when her father was already in Congress.

You know, I think inevitably because her father was a politician, her mother sort of gets erased from this narrative, but she was very much shaped by her mother. And she talks very frankly, which I think is interesting, about how stifled her mother was. Her mother had a lot of ambitions that she wasn't able to fulfill simply because she was a woman. She wanted to be an auctioneer. She wanted to go to law school. She wanted to have her own business.

And I tell this story in the book of how the mayor at the time, Joe Alioto, called her up and asked her to take this spot on the San Francisco Library Commission. And she turned him down. She said, well, you know, I'm perfectly happy being a volunteer. I'm happy to help. I don't need that kind of official position. And even though she considered him something of a chauvinist, a sort of old-fashioned man, he reprimanded her.",0

You should have something to show for it. You should have the power that comes with it. You should be able to make decisions. And this was really a revelation for her. And when she and I talked about it, she described it as a sort of feminist moment where she realized that, yes, she should be able to have that kind of power if she was going to be doing all the work. And everything sort of changed for her once she had that official position. She realized that, particularly as a woman, if you were just sort of talking, no one might listen to you. But if you had a vote, they had to respect you. They had to listen to your voice.",0

Nancy Pelosi decided, first, in 1988, she would run for one of these leadership posts, a whip. She stayed at it, eventually was elected the whip. She became the leader of the caucus in 2002. They were in the minority. So she told the post of minority leader and then eventually became speaker in 2007 after the Democrats won the majority in Congress in 2006. But running for these leadership posts is a little different from just serving in Congress. Tell us how you do it. How did she manage to win these internal battles for leadership?",0

So she wasn't really going to get anywhere by getting all the women in the House to vote for her. There just weren't that many. She needed to get all the men to take her seriously. She needed to get them to see her as someone who could do this job and wasn't just a sort of dilettante, as she was often caricatured. So getting those older and more conservative and male members to take her seriously and to see her as a force to be reckoned with was really crucial to her being able to win that position.",0

And, you know, you mentioned that in the 2000 congressional election cycle, she donated 3.9 million to other Democratic candidates. That's certainly a way to win a lot of friends.

BTW! # FJB,"BALL: She has always had a really remarkable amount of energy. She doesn't need a lot of sleep. I've never seen her eat an entire meal (laughter). She seems to - she doesn't drink coffee. She doesn't drink alcohol. She seems to live mostly on dark chocolate and chocolate ice cream, which she eats every day. But she has this incredible level of energy. And she traces a lot of it to being a mother. And as a mother myself, I identify with this a little bit. I think you find, when you become a mother for the first time - much less when you have five children - that the amount of capacity that you thought you had just increases exponentially when you - just because it's so much work to take care of small children.",0
1450943621046362112,Nancy Pelosi is so ugly her mama had to tie a pork chop around her neck to get the dog to play with her!!! BTW! # FJB,"And so a lot of her energy derived from having been - having had five children in the space of six years, and having to raise this large family. That sort of makes you the leader of a caucus, in a way. And I think some of it is just natural. I think some of it has just got to be the way that she is naturally. I've actually asked her this question. I'm certainly not the first to ask, well, where do you get all this energy? How do you do it? And she'll just give you this sort of blank look and say, well, I'm Italian. We have great stamina. And I think she really believes that she's just genetically superior for being Italian.",0

They're unreasonable. They want everything and they want it now. And they're not really interested in hearing why you need to get - you need them to do something else. So I do think that managing a caucus is a lot like managing a large family. And I think she did learn a lot from that. And, you know, a friend of Nancy Pelosi's, when she was still a youngish mother, said she knew she was destined for success in politics when she saw all five children folding their own laundry.",0
1450943621046362112,Nancy Pelosi is so ugly her mama had to tie a pork chop around her neck to get the dog to play with her!!! BTW! # FJB,"And the way she ran the house was disciplined. It was efficient. It was, you know, her - she hardly ever - I have a hard time believing this. But her children say she hardly ever had to scold them because she would just give them that cold glare of disappointment. And the shame that they would feel for disappointing her was enough to make them behave. And so I think you see that in the way she manages the House Democratic Caucus as well, that she doesn't often have to bring the hammer down and really punish people because they're just so afraid of disappointing her.",0

BTW! # FJB,"You know, for the first several years that Nancy Pelosi was the leader of the Democratic caucus, she was there when the Democrats were in a minority, and so it was a matter of getting the most she could with Republicans who were in charge. And you tell a number of stories. One that comes to mind is when Tom DeLay, the congressman from Texas, called her to say that they had to reduce the number of Democrats on one of the committees after this had all been agreed to. And she really showed some spine. How did she respond to him?",0
1450943621046362112,Nancy Pelosi is so ugly her mama had to tie a pork chop around her neck to get the dog to play with her!!! BTW! # FJB,"BALL: I love this answer. I love what she said to him when he told her that he was going to go back on this agreement she'd made with the Republican speaker at the time. She said, life on this planet as you know it will not be the same if you persist in this notion. So she was very much laying down a marker that said - and they tried to argue with her. They said, oh, we'll go out and badmouth you in the media if you do this. She said, I don't care. They said, well, actually, no, this is better for you. You get a larger percentage of the seats if the committee is smaller. She said, I don't care. We had an agreement. We're sticking to the agreement. And life as you know it will not be the same if you persist in this notion.",0
1450943621046362112,Nancy Pelosi is so ugly her mama had to tie a pork chop around her neck to get the dog to play with her!!! BTW! # FJB,"So from the very beginning, she was a very tough leader. She was a very strong leader. I think she viewed the leaders who'd come before her as being a little bit weak-willed and letting people get away with too much. And so at various points as minority leader before becoming speaker, a lot of what she was doing was trying to instill a sense of party discipline and wake up the Democratic caucus to the idea that they needed to work as a unit if they were going to have any kind of leverage in negotiations with the majority. And it is still, I think, the No. 1 thing that she says to and about her caucus today. She says, our diversity is our strength. Our unity is our power.",0
1450943621046362112,Nancy Pelosi is so ugly her mama had to tie a pork chop around her neck to get the dog to play with her!!! BTW! # FJB,"DAVIES: And we got to work as a team. It really is interesting because when you're in the minority, you have to know how far you can push, right? I mean, and part of that involves knowing the circumstances in which the Republican leaders will need some Democratic votes because their own caucus was restive and some of them wouldn't go along with leadership. And so it's one thing to be tough and show steel, but to do it well, you really have to have done the homework and know exactly where you stand, where the votes are, right?",0
1450943621046362112,Nancy Pelosi is so ugly her mama had to tie a pork chop around her neck to get the dog to play with her!!! BTW! # FJB,"BALL: That's right. And I think the other sort of favorite word in Nancy Pelosi's vocabulary is leverage. She always knows where those pressure points are, knows exactly what her leverage is. Sometimes it's that, as you say, the opposition is divided, and that means that if the Democrats are unified, they have a lot of leverage because the majority needs their votes. Another thing is just knowing what the priorities are. So in many of the negotiations with the Republican majority in the last few years, she knew that they wanted to increase military spending. So in order to get that, she was going to require them to increase some domestic spending or to protect some domestic spending that the Democrats cared about. So knowing those pressure points, knowing what it is your opponent values in the negotiation, enables her to to maximize that leverage.",0
1450943621046362112,Nancy Pelosi is so ugly her mama had to tie a pork chop around her neck to get the dog to play with her!!! BTW! # FJB,"And then just the fact that she is so effective - it becomes a sort of virtuous cycle, I guess you would say, that because she's so successful at keeping the Democratic caucus united, it gives her a lot of credibility in that negotiation to say, I can bring along all of my votes. Can you do that? Because I haven't seen you do that, but you've seen me do that a lot.",0
1450943621046362112,Nancy Pelosi is so ugly her mama had to tie a pork chop around her neck to get the dog to play with her!!! BTW! # FJB,"DAVIES: In 2006, the Democrats get the majority in Congress. She then becomes speaker the following January. And then in 2008, Barack Obama wins the White House. And Pelosi is speaker at a time when the Democrats control the White House and both houses of Congress. And you have a president with an ambitious policy agenda. And there were things they took on like the Affordable Care Act. But it's interesting that you write that one of the toughest things for her was dealing with President Obama. What was hard about that?",0
1450943621046362112,Nancy Pelosi is so ugly her mama had to tie a pork chop around her neck to get the dog to play with her!!! BTW! # FJB,"BALL: I don't think she would say that he was hard to deal with. I think she - they - the two of them became very close. And she cherished that relationship very much. And I think he came to respect her as well. But this was a common refrain during the Obama administration from Democrats in the House and Senate. They just never felt that Obama was fully engaged with the Congress and knew his way around the Congress. Having only been a senator for a few years, never having been in the House and, you know, not being the sort of schmoozer who is always having people over to the White House and wining and dining representatives and so on, many of the House Democrats were often frustrated with President Obama's negotiating abilities, felt that he was giving away too much on the front end and wasn't maximizing leverage. So if you can imagine, if you're someone like Nancy Pelosi who values leverage, that's going to be extremely frustrating.",0
1450943621046362112,Nancy Pelosi is so ugly her mama had to tie a pork chop around her neck to get the dog to play with her!!! BTW! # FJB,"DAVIES: Right. Well, and she was frustrated, as many in Congress were, that the Obama administration would want Congress to actually draft some of these really critical pieces of legislation, almost as if - I think you write - the Democrats in Congress felt that the Obama team wanted to get credit for these policy initiatives but not get their hands dirty in actually doing the work of making things happen. And then I guess the other thing was that Obama tended to think he was going to get Republican support. And she would tell him, no, they will string you along and then vote against you and then blame Democrats for everything that goes wrong.",0
1450943621046362112,Nancy Pelosi is so ugly her mama had to tie a pork chop around her neck to get the dog to play with her!!! BTW! # FJB,"BALL: That's right. She had had a lot of experience watching how the Republicans did business and had become, I think, pretty appropriately cynical about their willingness to work in a bipartisan fashion. So pretty much from the beginning, you know, you mentioned that Obama came in with this ambitious policy agenda. He also, of course, came in with a crashing economy. And so the first order of business was to try to do something about that. And Obama really did think that because the situation was so dire and because he had run on this message of sort of uniting the country and because he came in with this very strong popularity, he thought that he could get some Republican support.",0
1450943621046362112,Nancy Pelosi is so ugly her mama had to tie a pork chop around her neck to get the dog to play with her!!! BTW! # FJB,"But the Republicans pretty much decided at the outset that that was something they were not going to do. And Nancy Pelosi became a useful foil for them, in part because Obama was so popular, right? And they could always say, well, you know, we like Obama fine, but Nancy Pelosi and the Washington Democrats, they are the problem here. They're the ones getting in the way. They're the ones who won't work with us. And it wasn't true. She would've been willing to work across the aisle if she believed that they were really going to deal with her. But she also wasn't naive enough to think that they were totally sincere in all of their protestations.",0

1450943621046362112,Nancy Pelosi is so ugly her mama had to tie a pork chop around her neck to get the dog to play with her!!! BTW! # FJB,"BALL: She was really instrumental to its passage, and I don't think that her role has been fully appreciated. A lot of the histories of the Affordable Care Act have centered on President Obama or have centered on the challenge of getting it through the Senate. But she was key to getting it through the House. And not only that - when the Democrats lost their 60-vote majority in the Senate and had to essentially start from scratch, there were a lot of people in the White House in the Obama administration who wanted to give up, who thought that this just wasn't going to be possible. It was too large a hill to climb, and it was looking politically toxic as well, and maybe they should toggle back their ambitions and try for something a little bit smaller, something that wouldn't be truly universal but would maybe just increase the number of children with health insurance. And Nancy Pelosi was the one who in that meeting turned to President Obama and said, Mr. President, I know there are people urging you to take what she called the namby-pamby approach, and she was the one who stiffened his spine. Now, the president and his people will tell you that he never went wobbly, although there's some evidence that perhaps he did, but she was the one who said, I will help you make this happen. Let's not back down. We've come too far. Trying to get some form of universal access to health care was something that the Democrats had been trying to do for the better part of a century, and they were so close, and she was not going to let him give up at that moment.",0

She immediately started to think about, how can I deal with him? And they got on the phone, and he said some very nice things to her. And her very first thought, though, was, I have to protect the Affordable Care Act, because she knew that with Republicans, the only thing that had stopped Republicans from repealing the Affordable Care Act before was that President Obama would've vetoed it. But now that they had the majority in both houses of Congress and the presidency, it was a very real possibility. So she immediately kicked into high gear trying to ensure that the Affordable Care Act would not be repealed. And that was her very first priority.",0

Being the only woman leader - top leader of either party in Congress or the White House, she has spent most of her career being the only woman at the table when the president meets with the top leaders of Congress, and she believes that that's really important. So some people don't believe she actually would've stepped down. She certainly has a long record of refusing to step down, even after a loss. But she did say that she would've considered that and that she stayed in large part because she believed there needed to be a woman at that negotiating table.",0

Shortly after that 2018 election, you remember there was this high-stakes budget negotiation going on between the two parties that ended in a government shutdown. And before that, Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer went to the White House to meet with the president. And Trump, as he's done in a few of these settings, decided to invite the press to stay and film this negotiation that they thought was going to be private. And at one point, they're going back and forth about things like the border wall and whether the government's going to shut down.",0

And because there was this wave of women's political activism that started with Trump's election and has continued ever since, because there's so much anger on the left toward Trump and the Trump administration, I think that image immediately caught fire as sort of the fighter that Democrats needed, the figure who they felt could finally really stand up for them and stand up to Trump.

Obviously, it's a massive public policy challenge. And it's also a massive logistical challenge. And I don't think the Congress has figured out either part of that yet. She's been involved in the negotiations toward these four massive bills that have already been passed, spending nearly $3 trillion to try to keep, you know, workers and businesses and the health care system afloat. And the work there is not finished. I think she regards that as a partial success. She still thinks that more needs to be done.",0

Aren’t we a democracy, and don’t we have free and regular elections? Well, the primary way the wealthy get their way in politics is via political donations, which has gotten much worse since the Citizens United ruling. If a wealthy person or business donates large amounts of money to a politician’s campaign, then that politician can put that money toward campaign advertisements and campaign organization which really helps with outreach to voters. Being able to afford the best marketers, they can effectively pull the wool over voters’ eyes and make their opponents look bad, even if their opponents are sincere. This distorts the electoral process and biases it in favor of those who can raise the most money.",0

Well, she is the biggest of all the Democratic fundraisers [ https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2018/11/nancy-pelosi-returns-to-speakership/ ], and her “prowess as a fundraiser” is one major reason why she is Speaker. She does not just fundraise for herself, but also for the party as a whole. This is also part of why she is so disliked by most voters and many on both sides of the political spectrum. How? Well, for even most members of Congress, they must spend a lot of time talking to donors. 60 Minutes reported on this [ https://www.cbsnews.com/news/60-minutes-are-members-of-congress-becoming-telemarketers/ ], suggesting members of Congress may effectively be turning into “telemarketers” as they follow scripts to try to get more donations. But of course, all this time spent telemarketing is time they are not spending talking to their constituents or colleagues, or working on legislation. Nancy Pelosi is the biggest fundraiser out of all Democratic House members, at least, so this effect would be even more for her. And this is why so many people dislike her. All this time spent fundraising from primarily wealthy donors means she’s out of touch with the average American, and why she must do her donors’ bidding.",0
