1453468754692780035,Boris Johnson is an anti-Semitic dildo gibbon,The media tries hard not focus on his insults.,0
1453468754692780035,Boris Johnson is an anti-Semitic dildo gibbon,"For me the Darius Guppy affair [ http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/darius-boris-and-a-blast-from-the-past-1658043.html ] says that this is a man with very few morals. BoJo’s defenders will point out that he did nothing to provide his friend the ‘potential psychopath’ with the address of the journalist Guppy wanted to beat up. I will point out that as far as I know Johnson did not report his charming friend to the police (conspiring to have someone assaulted is a crime, you know) nor did he slip a word of warning to his fellow hack.",0
1453468754692780035,Boris Johnson is an anti-Semitic dildo gibbon,And the fact that Guppy felt he could call Johnson up and have a chance of him providing the information says mountains about his friends’ assessment of his character.,0
1453468754692780035,Boris Johnson is an anti-Semitic dildo gibbon,"I don't like him because I can't believe anything he says. Apparently, Jeremy Vine, has seen him make the same speech, complete with apparent fluffs and ad-libs, on two occasions. He is clearly a gifted performer but I don't want a good actor as PM, I want a serious statesman. In today's world of social media and instant outrage, he like most of his fellow politicians is playing to the vocal minority groups in the hope of building a power base. We're in trouble!",0
1453468754692780035,Boris Johnson is an anti-Semitic dildo gibbon,The man is an incompetent oaf who has no idea of the rule of consequences.,0
1453468754692780035,Boris Johnson is an anti-Semitic dildo gibbon,"This should have been obvious from the fact that he has no idea how many children he has fathered, displaying his ignorance of the consequences of unprotected sex.",0
1453468754692780035,Boris Johnson is an anti-Semitic dildo gibbon,"More seriously, he’s wound up in hospital by failing to heed his own advice to not shake hands with coronavirus sufferers. Scotland’s Chief Medical Officer, Dr Catherine Calderwood, was forced, quite rightly, to resign for a far lesser offence. Why the media aren’t baying for Johnson’s blood is beyond me. He is clearly the wrong man to lead the UK through this crisis.",0
1453468754692780035,Boris Johnson is an anti-Semitic dildo gibbon,Because of his successes. Because under that deliberately shambolic exterior he is a very effective political operator. Because this morning he polled as the most popular leader in the G7 countries.,0
1453468754692780035,Boris Johnson is an anti-Semitic dildo gibbon,Because he knowingly makes himself easy to mock,0
1453468754692780035,Boris Johnson is an anti-Semitic dildo gibbon,"Only a complete and utter idiot would do this sort of thing with photographers around, and not think they might look silly.",0
1453468754692780035,Boris Johnson is an anti-Semitic dildo gibbon,"Now, if he is a complete and utter idiot, and yet has become leader of the Conservative party, won an election by a healthy majority, and so on, that either implies the other tories and the opposition are even more stupid and useless…. or the clowning is an act, and the degree from Oxford is more representative of his actual intelligence.",0
1453468754692780035,Boris Johnson is an anti-Semitic dildo gibbon,I would like to think that I do not mock Johnson.,0
1453468754692780035,Boris Johnson is an anti-Semitic dildo gibbon,"However, I do frequently criticise Johnson and if it seems appropriate, I'll use humour to do so.",0
1453468754692780035,Boris Johnson is an anti-Semitic dildo gibbon,I criticise Johnson for lying to the country.,0
1453468754692780035,Boris Johnson is an anti-Semitic dildo gibbon,I criticise him for being dishonest and dishonourable.,0
1453468754692780035,Boris Johnson is an anti-Semitic dildo gibbon,I criticise him for being irresponsible ( e.g. failing to attend even one of the five Cobr coronavirus crisis meetings in January and February 2020. ),0
1453468754692780035,Boris Johnson is an anti-Semitic dildo gibbon,"I criticise him for making stupid decisions. ( e.g. ignoring SAGE recommendations for immediate action to control the spread of the virus, delaying for over 3 weeks before even introducing his short-lived October 3-tier system of restrictions. )",0
1453468754692780035,Boris Johnson is an anti-Semitic dildo gibbon,I criticise him for making illogical decisions. ( e.g. taking the country out of the 2nd lockdown when average new daily case numbers were rising ),0
1453468754692780035,Boris Johnson is an anti-Semitic dildo gibbon,"And obviously, I criticism him ( and the people who support and enable him ) for Johnson’s lunatic decisions to delay imposing the 3rd lockdown until January 2021, when case numbers, hospitalisations and deaths had been rising, rising and raising to record highs in December 2020.",0
1453468754692780035,Boris Johnson is an anti-Semitic dildo gibbon,"When it comes to mocking, I also criticise Johnson for his lunatic attempt ( in PMQ’s December 16th,) to mock anyone, who challenged his idea of a 5-day relaxation of social distancing restrictions for Christmas. Accusing them of wanting to cancel Christmas.",0
1453468754692780035,Boris Johnson is an anti-Semitic dildo gibbon,"If I mock him. I do so to criticise Johnson for being an irresponsible, dishonourable, dishonest, liar. Who repeatedly, makes stupid, idiotic and even lunatic decisions. Decisions that have had quite appalling consequences, including, but not limited to, many tens of thousands, of deaths that could and should have been avoided.",0
1453468754692780035,Boris Johnson is an anti-Semitic dildo gibbon,"For example, I imagine some people might describe Johnson or someone other politician making ‘car crash’ like decisions, or a career like a bumper car crashing from one accident to another, leaving a trail of destruction behind them. But such an analogy would be inadequate for Johnson and his time as PM. More appropriate to suggest Johnson's time as PM, is like a massive oversized juggernaut of a freight train, jammed full of people, being driving off its rails by Johnson. With his supporter, stocking the engine cheering him on, as they enable him, to stay at the controls. As the train ploughs into a densely populated city, running people over, smashing them and anything else in its path aside. As Johnson tries to pour on the power, only occasionally trying to turn the train aside, to avoid taking out a particularly tall tower block. All the time spewing out a stream of jingoistic phrases like turbo-charging or unleashing the economy.",0
1453468754692780035,Boris Johnson is an anti-Semitic dildo gibbon,"I hope it is clear that any measure of amusement, or mocking of Johnson, in my analogy, is intended to be secondary to my desire to illustrate and make memorable my criticism of Johnson and his actions.",0
1453468754692780035,Boris Johnson is an anti-Semitic dildo gibbon,Hope this helps.,0
1453468754692780035,Boris Johnson is an anti-Semitic dildo gibbon,"Johnson achieved national recognition on the quiz show, ‘Have I Got News For You’. The impression given was that he was a comic idiot. What is not appreciated by most people, is that he was being laughed at, not laughed with. A comic gets you laughing with them, a comic’s stooge is the one that is laughed at.",0
1453468754692780035,Boris Johnson is an anti-Semitic dildo gibbon,"The bumbling, hair-ruffling schtick is his act, not what he is like in private. The whole Bertie Wooster bit is a character he invented. The reality is that he is much nastier than that, as his ex-boss Max Hastings confirmed. A weathercock of opinion, he is weak-minded and devoid of moral fibre. He is supposed to exude charm, but I seem to be immune to that. What I see is a man who is self-obsessed and has delusions of adequacy. He thinks himself immune to standards of behaviour expected of everyone else.",0
1453468754692780035,Boris Johnson is an anti-Semitic dildo gibbon,A good British tradition is to deride the pompous and over-mighty. It is hardly possible to mock Johnson enough.,0
1453468754692780035,Boris Johnson is an anti-Semitic dildo gibbon,"So, to answer the question, Boris has cultivated a carefully choreographed persona that resembles something close to a bumbling baffoon with the ruffled hair and odd expressions to finish it off.",0
1453468754692780035,Boris Johnson is an anti-Semitic dildo gibbon,Mock BJ all you like; but underestimate him at your own peril.,0
1453468754692780035,Boris Johnson is an anti-Semitic dildo gibbon,"When BoJo the clown first appeared in Parliament - it’s not really correct to say he was elected, having been given a safe seat, like his deputy in London, The Malthouse Compromise (half man, half vegetable) - he apparently used to go behind the Speaker’s chair to ruffle his hair, so that he looked more clownish. This was an interesting tactic, used many times before and since (eg the zipwire stunt) as it distracted people from the truly nasty nature of the (for want of a better word) man.",0
1453468754692780035,Boris Johnson is an anti-Semitic dildo gibbon,"Johnson considers himself the natural successor of Churchill. I believe Max Hastings, his ex-boss at the Telegraph, said he was more like Alan Partridge, and that BoJo wouldn’t recognise the truth if it was in an identity parade in front of him. He prevaricates and postpones decisions until there’s only one possible path left. He lies constantly, relying on his glib charm and jokey manner to deflect criticism from his truly atrocious behaviour; as London Mayor, as the Brexit mouthpiece, as Foreign Secretary (he managed to INCREASE Nazanin Zagnari-Ratcliffe’s sentence), as PM - and as a human being. (He’s lost count of the number of affairs he’s had and the illegitimate kids he’s fathered). He has executed so many U-turns that he appears like a drunk driver - drunk, with power, in charge of the country.",0
1453468754692780035,Boris Johnson is an anti-Semitic dildo gibbon,"He hates scrutiny - as London Mayor, he told a scrutiny committee to ‘get stuffed’ when they asked how closing fire stations would ‘improve safety’, as he had claimed. He spends taxpayers’ money as if it were his own. He’s been fighting the Good Law Project, trying to avoid them publicising how he has directed billions to Tory donor companies under cover of the pandemic and allegedly addressing climate change. It would take several pages to document the myriad reasons why he’s unfit to serve in ANY office, leet alone as PM.",0
1453468754692780035,Boris Johnson is an anti-Semitic dildo gibbon,"So yes, he’s mocked, partly as a clown and partly because of his clear incompetence. But he’s dangerous. Eddie Mair, much missed from the BBC, once told BoJo to his face and on air “you’re a nasty piece of work,” and I can only agree. BoJo scores at least 36 out of 40 in the standard Psychopath Test, and as he and his cronies have taken back control and are busily trying to pass laws to limit protest, dissent or scrutiny, we should beware; like his pal The Donald, he’s capable of some very nasty behaviours if he doesn’t get his way.",0
1453468754692780035,Boris Johnson is an anti-Semitic dildo gibbon,The simple answer is because he is Prime Minister; and all Prime Ministers in my lifetime are mocked and hated by a large percentage of the population. Even the most popular ones such as Mrs Thatcher and Mr Blair had a great many detractors and more people voted against their respective parties than for them. And any senior politician is fair game for comedians and journalists; it goes with the job.,0
1453468754692780035,Boris Johnson is an anti-Semitic dildo gibbon,"With regard to Mr Johnson, even many in his own party do not like him, but he was fortunate enough in the 2019 General Election to have no effective opposition and certainly nobody who a disillusioned Conservative could vote for. Thus many who criticise him may well have voted Conservative.",0
1453468754692780035,Boris Johnson is an anti-Semitic dildo gibbon,"I remember as a student having tea with my tutor and a three other fellow students; the talk turned to Mrs Thatcher and we were all very critical of her, however as the talk progressed, I discovered that in fact that all of them had voted Conservative in the last General Election and would probably do so again; they did not particularly like Mrs Thatcher and many of her policies but regarded her as the least bad option, and there was a fear of what would happen if Mr Kinnock’s Labour got in (unjustified in my opinion).",0
1453468754692780035,Boris Johnson is an anti-Semitic dildo gibbon,"Quite frankly, because he is so eminently mockable and - more to the point - played up to it, presenting to the world a fake ‘lovable’ Boris persona who is always up for a laugh.",0
1453468754692780035,Boris Johnson is an anti-Semitic dildo gibbon,"Add to that the various ‘scrapes’ he has got himself into - lying to his then Shadow Cabinet boss and being sacked from the Shadow Cabinet, being caught time and again",0
1453468754692780035,Boris Johnson is an anti-Semitic dildo gibbon,"having an affair, his off-the-cuff remarks and gaffes and so much more - and for years Johnson got a pass from the voter because ‘he was Boris and we love him for it’.",0
1453468754692780035,Boris Johnson is an anti-Semitic dildo gibbon,"Actually, that persona is wholly dishonest: about 16 years ago, I (who didn’t and doesn’t regularly read the Daily Telegraph) read a piece by Charles Moore in which he starkly warned everyone about Boris Johnson. I remember it because it went quite against the grain of what everyone else was saying about Johnson. It stood out.",0
1453468754692780035,Boris Johnson is an anti-Semitic dildo gibbon,"Moore did not pull his punches: he had edited the Telegraph for eight years (1995 to 2003) and had been Johnson’s boss. He wasn’t complaining about Johnson perpetually being late filing his copy or the outrageous lies he told or anything like that, his piece was very personal.",0
1453468754692780035,Boris Johnson is an anti-Semitic dildo gibbon,"He warned that no one, but no one, should fall for Johnson’s ‘lovable persona’: it was a convenient and calculated mask. Johnson, Moore wrote, was hugely ambitious and, more to the point, was utterly, utterly ruthless and would stop at nothing to get what he wanted. (He even agreed to arrange to have a fellow journalist beaten up on behalf of his friend Darius Guppy, who was later jailed for a £1.8 million fraud).",0
1453468754692780035,Boris Johnson is an anti-Semitic dildo gibbon,"NB on 10/05/21 - It’s been pointed out to me that what I have highlighted above is not actually true and I shall withdraw the allegation. But I think it better to leave it in place and add this explanation. In fact Guppy asked Johnson to supply the address of journalist Guppy wanted to have beaten up and Johnson agree to try to find it, but couldn’t. The planned assault didn’t take place.",0
1453468754692780035,Boris Johnson is an anti-Semitic dildo gibbon,As I say Moore was so outspoken and what he said so different to what everyone else was saying about Johnson that I’ve remembered it to this day.,0
1453468754692780035,Boris Johnson is an anti-Semitic dildo gibbon,"For many years Johnson rode a wave of public approval and appreciation and the laughs were on his side. Now they no longer are. He has achieved his life-long ambition of becoming Prime Minister (and quite ludicrously, though apparently seriously, sees himself as a ‘new Winston Churchill’), but it really does seem that beyond ‘becoming PM’ (as the little lad he was wanted) he had no idea of what he would actually do as PM: he has no - or seems not to have any - philosophy, convictions or political principles of any kind.",0
1453468754692780035,Boris Johnson is an anti-Semitic dildo gibbon,"His championship of Brexit, perpetually paraded on these pages as his ‘crowning achievement’ was a pragmatic, not to say cynical, decision to advance the cause of Boris Johnson.",0
1453468754692780035,Boris Johnson is an anti-Semitic dildo gibbon,"Although he often ridiculed the EU in his Telegraph reports and columns (and made up ‘facts’ about ‘straight bananas’ - more of the laughter from the gallery he craves), he is on record as favouring the single market and other aspects of the EU. But all that went out of the window when he had the chance to become Tory Party leader (and thus PM).",0
1453468754692780035,Boris Johnson is an anti-Semitic dildo gibbon,"He calculated that Brexiters were much in the majority in the party, and thus being one of their number would substantially boost his chances of winning the leadership election. It is that kind of ultra-cynical, self-centred behaviour which Moore got to know and dislike when he was Johnson’s boss.",0
1453468754692780035,Boris Johnson is an anti-Semitic dildo gibbon,"As I say, it didn’t matter while he was then, more or less, someone of little consequence. His mayoralty of London is largely seen as a success, but it seems his gift was for judiciously delegating various tasks and roles. A true measure of the man’s abilities can be gauged by just how awful he was as Theresa May’s Foreign Secretary. He was terrible. He was said never to have read his briefs, never being prepared for meetings (all of which, for a foreign secretary are important) and generally being extremely lazy.",0
1453468754692780035,Boris Johnson is an anti-Semitic dildo gibbon,"He is also, spuriously, being credited with ‘beating the covid crisis’. If only. The action on covid was a joint endeavour and there is even the story - which highlights just what a dodgy character he is - that in one SAGE meeting he asked the room ‘Who’s in charge here’, to be told bluntly by his then Cabinet Office secretary ‘You are, Prime Minister’.",0
1453468754692780035,Boris Johnson is an anti-Semitic dildo gibbon,He was also known to leave such meetings after being summoned by his fiancee Carrie Symonds to help choose wallpaper for the Downing St flat that was being redecorated.,0
1453468754692780035,Boris Johnson is an anti-Semitic dildo gibbon,All this would be funny if it wasn’t quite so serious: this is the man who ‘has his finger on the nuclear’ button. This is the man who will have the final say if China and Russia decided on some kind of hot confrontation. It does not inspired confidence.,0
1453468754692780035,Boris Johnson is an anti-Semitic dildo gibbon,"The Brits love to mock. We are a bolshy lot, and the kind of nauseating reverence the Americans show for their President makes us cringe. They treat whoever it is as some kind of republican royalty and can never get enough of scraping along on their knees and prostrating themselves before him (so far not a her). We reserve our veneration for small-time TV celebrities and sportsmen and women.",0
1453468754692780035,Boris Johnson is an anti-Semitic dildo gibbon,"As I say, we laughed at but with Johnson for many years and that is what he wanted us to do. Now, given how his buffoonery might take Britain into rather dangerous places - he wants to decided whether or not his redecoration of the flat should be investigated - we just laugh at him (and anyone who can take him seriously).",0
1453468754692780035,Boris Johnson is an anti-Semitic dildo gibbon,"Because Boris has deliberately orchestrated this persona. He gives the impression of being a hapless buffoon and is happy to be mocked . It is a a distraction from who he really is.He actually is a scheming demagogue,who has always believed it was his destiny to be Prime minister. He has lied, cheated and connived to get there. In reality he is a self serving narcissist, a psychopath, who has no concern for anyone but himself. He would rather be mocked as a clown than seen as the monster that he is.",0

1453448158692925441,@sectradeideas @YahooNews Boris Johnson is a tyrant. Even MPs in his own party are speaking out against his draconi,"This article was translated from German by Rosalie Delaney.
• June 2016: 'The will of the British people' After a shrill referendum campaign, nearly 52% of British voters opted to leave the EU on June 23. Polls had shown a close race before the vote with a slight lead for those favoring remaining in the EU. Conservative British Prime Minister David Cameron, who had campaigned for Britain to stay, acknowledged the ""will of the British people"" and resigned the following morning.
• Former Home Secretary Theresa May replaced David Cameron as prime minister on July 11 and promised the country that ""Brexit means Brexit."" May had quietly supported the Remain campaign before the referendum. She did not initially say when her government would trigger Article 50 of the EU treaty to start the two-year talks leading to Britain's formal exit.
• March 2017: 'We already miss you' May eventually signed a diplomatic letter over six months later on March 29, 2017 to trigger Article 50. Hours later, Britain's ambassador to the EU, Tim Barrow, handed the note to European Council President Donald Tusk. Britain's exit was officially set for March 29, 2019. Tusk ended his brief statement on the decision with: ""We already miss you. Thank you and goodbye.""
• British Brexit Secretary David Davis and the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, kicked off talks in Brussels on June 19. The first round ended with Britain reluctantly agreeing to follow the EU's timeline for the rest of the negotiations. The timeline split talks into two phases. The first would settle the terms of Britain's exit, and the second the terms of the EU-UK relationship post-Brexit.
• The second round of talks in mid-July began with an unflattering photo of a seemingly unprepared British team. It and subsequent rounds ended with little progress on three phase one issues: How much Britain still needed to pay into the EU budget after it leaves, the post-Brexit rights of EU and British citizens and whether Britain could keep an open border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.
• Leaders of the remaining 27 EU members formally agreed that ""sufficient progress"" had been made to move on to phase two issues: the post-Brexit transition period and the future UK-EU trading relationship. While Prime Minister Theresa May expressed her delight at the decision, European Council President Tusk ominously warned that the second stage of talks would be ""dramatically difficult.""
• British ministers appeared to back a Brexit plan at May's Chequers residence on July 6. The proposal would have kept Britain in a ""combined customs territory"" with the EU and signed up to a ""common rulebook"" on all goods. That went too far for British Foreign Minister Boris Johnson and Brexit Secretary David Davis, who resigned a few days later. May replaced them with Jeremy Hunt and Dominic Raab.
• May's Chequers proposal did not go down well with EU leaders, who told her at a summit in Salzburg in late September that it was unacceptable. EU Council President Tusk trolled May on Instagram, captioning a picture of himself and May looking at cakes with the line: ""A piece of cake perhaps? Sorry, no cherries."" The gag echoed previous EU accusations of British cherry-picking.
• EU leaders endorsed a 585-page draft divorce deal and political declaration on post-Brexit ties in late November. The draft had been widely condemned by pro- and anti-Brexit lawmakers in the British Parliament only weeks earlier. Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab resigned along with several other ministers, and dozens of Conservative Party members tried to trigger a no-confidence vote in May.
• In the face of unrelenting opposition, May postponed a parliamentary vote on the deal on December 10. The next day, she met with German Chancellor Angela Merkel to seek reassurances that would, she hoped, be enough to convince skeptical lawmakers to back the deal. But while she was away, hard-line Conservative lawmakers triggered a no-confidence vote. May won the vote a day later.
• The UK Parliament voted 432 to 202 against May's Brexit deal on January 16. In response to the result, European Council President Donald Tusk suggested the only solution was for the UK to stay in the EU. Meanwhile, Britain's Labour Party called for a no-confidence vote in the prime minister, her second leadership challenge in as many months.
• May tried to get legal changes to the deal's so-called Irish backstop in the weeks that followed. She eventually got assurances that the UK could suspend the backstop under certain circumstances. But on March 12, Parliament voted against the revised Brexit deal by 391 to 242. EU leaders warned the vote increased the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit. Two days later, MPs voted to delay Brexit.
• Following the second defeat of May's divorce deal, the European Council met in Brussels on March 21 to decide what to do next. EU leaders gave May two options: delay Brexit until May 22 if MPs vote for the withdrawal deal or delay it until April 12 if they vote against the deal. If the deal were to fail again in Parliament, May could ask for a long extension.
• On March 29, the day that the UK was supposed to leave the EU, British lawmakers voted for a third time against May's deal — rejecting it this time with a vote of 344 to 286. Following the latest defeat, May approached the main opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn in an attempt to find a compromise, angering hardline Brexiteers in her own Conservative party.
• With the April 12 deadline looming after the third defeat of May's deal, EU leaders met again in Brussels to discuss a second delay. The only question was how long should it be? In the end, the UK and EU agreed to a ""flexible"" extension until October 31 — which can end sooner if the Brexit deal is approved. The UK had to take part in EU elections in May because their exit wasn't secured in time.
• Weeks of talks between Prime Minister Theresa May and the Labour party to reach a deal proved unsuccessful and further eroded her political capital. She triggered an angry backlash from her party after she tried to put the option of a second referendum on the table. The series of failures led May to announce her resignation, effective June 7, in an emotional address.
• After Theresa May announced on June 7 that she would leave office, other members of her Conservative party began clamoring for the top job. Within a month, the leadership battle came down to Jeremy Hunt (left), an EU proponent who fears a no-deal scenario, and Boris Johnson (right), one of the main proponents of Brexit.
• At the end of July 2019, Johnson was officially named Theresa May's successor as British prime minister. ""We are going to energize the country, we are going to get Brexit done by October 31,"" he said after he was elected leader of the Conservative Party.
• Conservative rebels and opposition MPs backed efforts to delay an October 31 Brexit deadline in fear of a no-deal departure. In response, Johnson called for a general election, saying his government cannot rule without a mandate after he stripped 21 rebel MPs of their Conservative status. The Labour Party said it would not back elections until legislation to block a no-deal Brexit was in place.
• In late September, Britain's highest court ruled that Johnson's decision to suspend Parliament ahead of the UK's planned exit was unlawful. ""This was not a normal prorogation in the run-up to a Queen's Speech,"" said the Supreme Court. Political rivals immediately called on Johnson to leave his post. Johnson said he would abide by the court ruling, though said he ""strongly"" disagreed.
• British Prime Minister Boris Johnson managed to secure a deal with European negotiators that would allow the UK to leave the EU in an orderly manner. The deal received unanimous backing from the leaders of 27 other member states. But an attempt to get the UK Parliament to sign off on the deal failed. Instead, Parliament pushed for the Brexit deadline to be extended until the end of January 2020.
• On December 22, UK lawmakers vote for Prime Minister Johnson's European Union withdrawal bill, which will see a leave date of January 31 2020 enshrined in law. Getting a majority to vote to pass the bill in the lower house has proven a major sticking point for the PM, but following a general election Johnson's Conservative party won control of the house and the bill passed with a 124 majority.
• After months of disagreements over fishing rights and future business rules, the EU and UK clinched a post-Brexit trade deal on Christmas Eve. Prime Minister Boris Johnson hailed the deal, saying the UK has ""taken back control of our laws and our destiny."" The deal will allow the UK and the EU to trade without tariffs, but also impose limitations on free movement and financial services.",0

Even MPs in his own party are speaking out against his draconi,"Looking at the genealogy of Falstaff and putting his character in a late 16th century context, there are some interesting parallels with politics today. By the 1580s, Puritans were producing pamphlets [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marprelate_Controversy#:~:text=The%20Marprelate%20Controversy%20was%20a,which%20remained%20an%20established%20church ] (the so-called Martin Marprelate  [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Marprelate ]tracts) characterising the “Popish” English Church as venal and corrupt. Their pamphlets were not subtle, with the clergy mocked in an irreverent and comic manner. It was a kind of fake news of its day: light on facts, heavy on ad hominem. It caused an outrage: laughing at bishops just wasn’t cricket. Anti-Puritans caught on that it was pointless responding to the Martinists in any reasoned, coherent manner. It just sounded pompous. So the anti-Puritans came up with a new strategy: they joined in the obscene fun, levelling equally cruel (and amusing) insults at the Martinists in their own series pamphlets. Well, if you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em. These anti-Puritan caricatures eventually made their way onto the stage. Falstaff is based on John Oldcastle [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Oldcastle ], who, as a Lollard [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lollardy ], was very unlikely to have shared Plump Jack’s predilection for thievery, comely wenches and sack [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sack_(wine) ].",0

Decrying the “Popish” EU with a plethora of outlandish claims isn’t what you’d expect from a professional journalist - but it’s exactly what you’d expect from a Martinist. The point of Boris’s submissions was to throw enough mud over the years to make the EU look ridiculous. No facts required. And it worked. Further, actually debating Boris’s outrageous claims [ https://infacts.org/mythbusts/brussels-didnt-ban-prawn-cocktail-crisps/ ] then becomes part of the anarchic hullabaloo.

[1]
As a construct, Falstaff bridges a post-Reformation era polarised between Puritans and anti-Puritans. Call it an Elizabethan culture war. Falstaff (like Johnson’s monster, Boris) doesn’t work if you make him king. Becoming prime minister was never a very good idea. Johnson, somewhat predictably, has presided over a shell government; he’s busy looking busy and the Conservative party is looking increasingly hollowed out. Quite possibly his SPAD and ideas man, Mr Cummings, is really the captain of the ship.

In short, in the United States, the burden of proof for libel is on the person claiming to have been libeled — that is, the plaintiff has to demonstrate that what was written is false (at least in cases involving matters of public concern). In the United Kingdom, the burden of proof is on the party accused of libel — that is, The Sun had to prove that what it published about Depp was true. A judge held that it had met that burden and that 12 of 14 of Heard's accusations of abuse met the threshold for truth in civil court. Depp's attorneys say they plan to appeal. (Depp is also suing Heard for defamation in a U.S. court after she published an op-ed in The Washington Post identifying herself as a survivor of sexual and physical violence.)",0

However, there are a few different parts of Amber’s own account that are very atypical for someone who is truly being abused. When someone is a victim of abuse, they are often in survival mode; fight or flight mode. Or, as the more nuanced research indicates, fight, flight, freeze, flop, or friend (the 5 F’s [1]). The victim also usually goes to great lengths to avoid doing anything that might send their abuser into a fit of rage. Sadly, and as in my case as well, there is no way to avoid the abuser’s rage anywhere even close to 100% of the time. In addition, the victim virtually always experiences constant hyper-vigilance in order to quickly detect threats.",0

Many of the accusations Depp raised, such as Heard cutting off his finger, or shitting in his bed, to be unlikely when looked at in detail.

He is in his own kitchen, likely one of the few places he can be a human without someone shoving a camera in front of his face. He’s walking around, slamming a few doors, he throws a wine glass into the sink. It smashes. Probably angry, yes. Not an angel, but that isn’t abuse. His so-called supportive wife sits there sipping coffee, re-angling the camera to get a better shot whilst repeatedly prodding him with questions when his situation most likely hasn’t got anything to do with her. She makes it about herself. Even when he notices the camera he is calmer than I would have been. He places the wine glass down before grabbing her phone. An abusive person likely would have smashed that wine glass over her head in a fit of rage. A domestic violence victim probably wouldn’t even sit there filming him in the first place, it is EXTREMELY dangerous. He grabs the phone and from what I can see, chucks it in the bin.",0

I informed him that I was not going to open the door. The man then said that he could also go outside and I could open a window instead. He said it was possible for us to chat like that. I informed him that if he wasn't going to leave at once, I would call the police. The man left.",0

I had recently been a victim of another crime that I had reported to the police. The senior police officer with whom I talked in the ‘sala de víctima’ (victim’s room) was super friendly and nice (not like Estonian policemen who are not friendly and nice). He even nodded understandingly when I told him to shoot the criminals. I think I told him: “You have a gun. Shoot them!” I only said it because I was upset and angry. I did not mean it. But the policeman didn't even reprimand me for my murderous suggestion. He just nodded understandingly. What a nice man! I still have the copy of the police report in Catalan he wrote. It is now a souvenir. Anyway, I didn't like the name of the room where we had talked. I didn't want to be a victim again. The second reason was purely rational.

Then I'ma start rocking gold teeth and fangs
Cause that’s what a muthafucking monster do

Hotter than a Middle Eastern climate, find it

I am not sensitive to foul language, it's just sort of annoying to constantly hear it every time she's trying to tell a story. Also, I stopped following her because just as Nicki Minaj knows Cardi is being used — I know it and see it as well.

1453435272159502342,Kanye West is a motherfucking GOD https://t.co/yqAQ6af7yP,"You ask your question having made the judgment that “fuck” is a “bad” word. There is nothing inherently bad about the word—or any word, for that matter. A word is just a collection of sounds used to express an idea. The collection of sounds /fʌk/ (which, written in IPA, feels significantly less threatening) expresses the idea of copulation. Nothing more, nothing less. And if the word “copulation” doesn’t fill you with rage, nor should “fuck”.",0
1453435272159502342,Kanye West is a motherfucking GOD https://t.co/yqAQ6af7yP,"What makes people uncomfortable with words is stigma. Somewhere, some time ago, someone felt uncomfortable with the concept of sex—and so they felt uncomfortable with the very mention of—that is to say: the word representing—the concept. “It’s un-godly.” “It’s impure.” “Only sailors and thieves talk about such subjects.” “I don’t know how to talk to my children about sex, so I’ll just never mention it.” Get enough people on board with that fear and shame, and you’ve got yourself a cultural movement agreeing that this it somehow a “bad” word.",0
1453435272159502342,Kanye West is a motherfucking GOD https://t.co/yqAQ6af7yP,"Then people take that shocking word, and they use it to reproduce those shocking, uncomfortable feelings in people for dramatic effect. That’s what swearing is—using a word that society has deemed improper in order to express a heightened state of emotion by demonstrating your rage-fueled willingness to test the boundaries of accepted propriety. In other words: “Wow, Max must be really mad if he’s using words that he knows are forbidden.” Swearing makes people pay attention to what Max is saying, and that makes Max feel validated, understood, important, or even powerful. These feelings are ultimately the goal of any human attempt to communicate.",0
1453435272159502342,Kanye West is a motherfucking GOD https://t.co/yqAQ6af7yP,"However, as they tend to do, people evolve and change. Things that were once shocking grow boring and mundane. Where a woman once couldn’t show her ankles, she now embraces the side-boob. (Just no nipples; America hates women’s nipples.) And so words that were once shocking become every-day terms. But this process is slow and tedious, which explains why you’re uncomfortable with the word “fuck”, while others are starting to use it willy-nilly.",0

1453435272159502342,Kanye West is a motherfucking GOD https://t.co/yqAQ6af7yP,"There are a lot of elements to this, but ultimately I think it's a byproduct of a devised marketing strategy. If we choose to define an 'act' as somewhat of a ploy or a cheap marketing scheme, it is and it's not. First of all, in order for Kanye to market his music well, he needs to be authentic. In other words, he needs to be himself. What the public knows about Kanye and what his fans know about him are completely different, as are the perception of most controversial artists such as Miley Cyrus in 2013 and Lady Gaga in the preceding years. To the world, Kanye might be a self-aggrandizing egomaniac, but he believes he deserves to occupy that title and fans of his work - old and/or new - might agree too. After all, he's earned his share of success, and he has built a name for himself. Thus, he has a right to capitalize on the image that he has constructed unto himself, not away from himself. To state that he has a 'public persona' means that we could argue he has a completely different, or dissimilar persona apart from his 'public persona'.",0
1453435272159502342,Kanye West is a motherfucking GOD https://t.co/yqAQ6af7yP,"This isn't true to an extent - Kanye has consistently tapped onto his social media and even if he doesn't live up to his 'public persona', the internet and the overall media can confirm that he does entirely live off of that one persona - the power, the riches and the fame is what he's all about right now. But of course, it's naive to not consider him constructing a well-thought image for himself, because what would we be doing here, prying on his actions and regarding every insignificant advances if it weren't for a carefully conceived strategy? It is wise to understand the nature of this, you cannot consider things to be black and white. Everything - ideas, executions and manifestations - has its own shade, nothing is fixed and everything is mostly fluid. Artists are people too, they have just as much chance to grow, evolve, reinvent as they have the chance to stick to the congruence of their image, the comfort of their habits and the will to pave their way.",0
1453435272159502342,Kanye West is a motherfucking GOD https://t.co/yqAQ6af7yP,"To consider a conscious strategy an act, is a basis that can be confirmed only to the eyes of its beholder. I personally think that it isn't an act, he's working his ass off to set himself apart from his competitors. Think of Azealia Banks, if her verbally violent trivialities were considered as an 'act' - which begs to satisfy only a short period of time towards her image and her artistry - the effect would've impacted differently towards the growth of her career. Yet, she still lives like she always does and she's comfortable with doing that, it was never an act. Consider Miley Cyrus's authenticity. Her 'Wrecking Ball' music video - which was meant to exude vulnerability - was largely considered an act as well, but in truth, her growth as a person through her evolution as an artist allowed her to reunite with Liam Hemsworth.",0
1453435272159502342,Kanye West is a motherfucking GOD https://t.co/yqAQ6af7yP,"So I'm here to ask you, whether you think it's an act or not, because personally the definition of an 'act' is vague, it is an unfair perception game. We can all make 'acts' in our life, but I choose to see it as a label to define actions that possess a certain weight of shock value and generates enough dramatic effects for people to suddenly tune their attention towards it. Therefore, I also choose to see that these particular 'acts' are just key actions and/or activities that can truly live up to revealing our authentic selves to the world.",0

He is recognised as one of the best lyricists in the world because of his ability to utilise internal rhymes and even rhyme every syllable in a verse.

So much of rap is about saying “I’m the greatest” but in this song, Eminem isn’t afraid to tear himself apart, even if it’s just for the benefit of the story.

1453435272159502342,Kanye West is a motherfucking GOD https://t.co/yqAQ6af7yP,"Before I explain why Eminem dissed Lil Wayne, first I’ll have to give you some details about Wayne’s rap career. From 2005–2010, Wayne was the biggest rapper in the world. His main buzz started with the release of his album Tha Carter II in 2005. Prior to the release of the album, Wayne released a single called “Fireman” to promote the album. Tha Carter II went platinum in 6 weeks. Fast forward to 2006, Wayne released “Dedication 2”, which is a mixtape. If you google “Top 50 mixtapes of the millennium”, an article by Pitchfork will pop up. Pitchfork has “Dedication 2” as number 6 on their greatest mixtapes. Fast forward to 2007, Wayne released yet another free mixtape titled “Da Drought 3”. Da Drought 3 is regarded as the greatest mixtape of all time by many, Pitchfork has it at #1. At this time, Wayne was calling himself “The Greatest Rapper alive” and he was proving it by being consistent and rapping on other rappers beats better than themselves. His wordplay and flow was untouchable. Obviously calling yourself the greatest rapper would rub other rappers the wrong way and make them want to diss you. Back then, if Lil Wayne remixed your song it wasn’t your song anymore and that’s what his mixtapes consisted of, him rapping on other rappers beats. In the midst of releasing all these free mixtapes that anyone could listen to without paying, Wayne was on darn near every song on the radio. Almost every musical artist was featuring him to the point to where every time you turned on the radio, you heard Wayne. No rapper has done that many features within that amount of time.",0
1453435272159502342,Kanye West is a motherfucking GOD https://t.co/yqAQ6af7yP,"Now also in 2007, rapper 50 cent did an interview with Funk Masterflex where he asked 50 cent how he felt about Lil Wayne appearing on so many songs. 50 cent basically called Wayne a “rap whore” for doing songs with any and everybody. The same year MTV named Wayne as #1 for their “Hottest MCs in the game” list and 50 cent had something negative to say about that as well. 50 cent proceeded to diss Wayne in a song called “part time lover” where he said “I’ll kiss you like Lil Wayne kisses Birdman”. At the end of 2007, Wayne released a legendary song called “Gossip” where he addresses all his haters but he doesn’t specifically mention names. A year later a Wayne song called “Louisianimal” was leaked where Wayne dissed 50 cent by saying “I’m all about a dollar, Fuck 2 quarters, bitch I pour syrup in that vitamin water”. ( 2 quarters is 50 cent obviously and vitamin water was 50 cents product). Wayne also dissed 50 in a song called “Let’s talk money” with Pimp C where he said, “That nigga Pimp called me before he left this bitch; Told me keep doin’ ya thing and don’t tell 50 shit” In that line, Wayne uses wordplay on 50 cents name and the 5–0 slang term which means police officer, basically calling 50 a rat. Pimp C died before this song was released and Wayne is saying Pimp C told him not to respond to 50 and just keep getting money.",0
1453435272159502342,Kanye West is a motherfucking GOD https://t.co/yqAQ6af7yP,"In 2008, Wayne released his biggest album, Tha Carter 3. It sold a million copies and went triple platinum.

1453435272159502342,Kanye West is a motherfucking GOD https://t.co/yqAQ6af7yP,"Around 2008 is also when Wayne first reached out to Eminem to do a song together but Eminem didn’t respond. Most likely because 50 cent and Eminem are very close friends, so how would he look doing a song with 50 cents enemy? Fast forward to 2009, 50 cent appeared on another radio show where they asked him about Wayne and 50 said “Wayne is a talented artist, you can’t take that away from him, but if you put him a battle situation my consistency will break his neck”.",0
1453435272159502342,Kanye West is a motherfucking GOD https://t.co/yqAQ6af7yP,"Now to the diss song in question, Eminem did a song with Pink in 2010 called “Won’t back down” where he disses Wayne. It was off of his album “The Recovery” so the song was probably recorded in early 2009. The line goes, “Lil Wayne slurps syrup til he burps and smokes purp does a word search gets circles rapped around him”.",0
1453435272159502342,Kanye West is a motherfucking GOD https://t.co/yqAQ6af7yP,"Now also in 2010, Eminem appeared on Big Boy radio where Eminem reflected on a time when he was in a dark place and was jealous of Lil Wayne and Kanye West because of how popular they were and he wanted to do a diss song on them. But he said that dissing Wayne at the time would be “career suicide” for Eminem, himself. He was reflecting about a time years prior to 2010.

1453435272159502342,Kanye West is a motherfucking GOD https://t.co/yqAQ6af7yP,Conclusion: Eminem dissed Lil Wayne because of his competitiveness and jealousy of how big Wayne was at the time.,0

One hard wired habit we have from our ancestors we can't seem to shake is that we need to eat as much as we can NOW in case we can't find more food for a while. Skinny individual generally don't think that way, they eat however much it takes to feel satisfied and leave the rest for later. Their reasoning is often that they don't want to be so full it hinders their ability to work/play or if they eat so much now it will affect them wanting more of it later.
 * Love of liquid (especially water) skinny individual will often get a bad wrap for only drinking their food. 9/10 skinny people will either subconsciously or consciously make sure they have access to at least water at all times, which isn't too hard in most of today's world. This goes hand in hand with not eating till you are full. Their body may often need some extra energy then what they have been provided and will actually take from the fat storage. However, in order for your body to do anything with fat it needs water molecules to break it up first. So, yes, water is important.

On the other side of the ledger, Shakespeare’s plays describe entirely conventional morals. He seemed to think that it’s great for couples to fall in love and get married. There is no hint of resentment about marriage anywhere in his plays. In the play Much Ado about Nothing, the possibility that a woman had an extramarital affair is seen as unacceptable.

She was about the right age for marriage. It was unusual for Shakespeare to go to the altar so young, but on the other hand it is very likely he was forced to grow up quickly: his father was a shut in. John Shakespeare was once the equivalent of the mayor of Stratford Upon Avon. But by the time Will was ten, he was in very deep trouble with the law for illegally trading in wool. Shakespeare was the oldest son in that family and a lot of emphasis then would have been placed on him as an heir; eldest sons were expected to learn their trade from their fathers starting at age nine and were prepared for the day they would be the paterfamilias.",0

Joan was still young, too. And by 1582, Mary, his mother, had birthed another baby, a boy named Edmund. It is very likely that John Shakespeare was in a deep funk, moping and mentally infirm, since by this point they weren’t even occupying the whole of the house on Henley Street you see today on the tour.

That was not uncommon for Stratford at the time. The older books are wrong on this, so ignore it if you see it: a lot of old Victorian historians had it backwards regarding sexual mores of the age and though now disproven their theory is still out there on bookshelves. The records of South Warwickshire towns show that there were plenty of girls going to the altar already pregnant. Poor Anne was already stuck taking care of her half siblings by the time her father was dying. Her brother Bartholomew inherited the farm on the outskirts of town and a big chunk of the inheritance (Anne inherited something, but the custom of the time was that the boys got most of it and Bart was a co manager of the farm with his stepmother. This is not to say that she was thrown a few peanuts and that’s that: it was about right for the age and today would be the equivalent of inheriting enough money to buy a used Volkswagen Beetle. Richard Hathaway clearly did not think his oldest daughter was chopped liver. ) It’s believed her younger full sister had already moved away and married. She was stuck. Will was stuck being the head of the house in his father’s incapacity. If a wild guess had to be made, they commiserated. They had known each other for a long time. And nature took its course.

We know she kept in contact with her brother after she wed: he appears in records years later , loans Shakespeare made to his brother-in-law in what looks like Will giving a hand in helping Bart make a few home repairs.

Not a peep. The lore surrounding the marriage actually says that both sides wanted the match. (It is totally certain that Richard knew John: they appear together in a court record in 1566, Richard is accused of stealing something, and it is John who gets him out of the jam.) The license for the marriage was issued with Hathaway neighbors standing by as surety, the same ones that oversaw Richard’s will and probably were chosen because of their closeness to the bride’s father.

She was very lucky to have made it because back then they were blunderers regarding obstetrics compared to now: one birthing manual of the time said to push one twin back to allow the first to be born if both crowd at the birth canal (that can cause cerebral palsy in the right conditions.) A woman today who is pregnant with twins is likely to survive the experience unless a freak accident happens. Women pregnant with twins had an above average death rate in England at the time. Usually a woman in labor would go into a darkened room with a roaring fireplace, even in summer. She would be surrounded by female relatives and friends whose whole conception of medicine would not be even close to correct for another 2 centuries: they wouldn’t know that hot pickle juice mixed with wormwood is not medicine for any reason no matter what the woman’s hair color is or what her zodiac sign is.

Caesareans always resulted in death of the mother since they couldn’t sew her up again properly and exposed her to infection just by touching her. They didn’t know childbed fever was caused by unwashed hands: even royal physicians unwittingly killed their patients that way, Elizabeth of York and Jane Seymour to name but two cases. If they had to perform a makeshift episiotomy, it was in God’s hands if she lived at all and it made the mother incontinent if she did live. Anne Shakespeare had no more children after the birth of these twins, and it was not uncommon to be afraid to try again since even the most blind Tudor era man would notice that twins ran in families. (A more realistic portrait of William Shakespeare at this time in his life is not the playwright and Superman of Sonnets. It is of a young man with all the color drained from his face as his wife, younger sister, mother, sister in law, stepmother in law, and a local midwife are crowded in one room upstairs.

Opportunities were not turning up in the way Will needed with little children to care for and a family in dire straits, so he set off for London. He left his wife in the care of his mother, father, and brother who if I had a guess was holding down the glove shop by this point since he became a hat maker later in life (Joan Shakespeare, William’s sister, also married a hatmaker: the skills needed for the trade were not far apart.) London of 1585–88 would have not been exactly Disneyland. Soldiers and sailors would have been heading off to war with Spain and the place’s worst neighborhoods were already rough as is-it would have been better to keep Anne safe in Stratford, where she could not be mugged or made the sport of an overzealous soldier. By 1592 he had the college educated and entitled theatre snobs enraged because he had a lot more talent as a writer than them. There is evidence he may have been writing bits and bobs for other playwrights like Kyd before going solo while freelancing as an actor. Anne was still at home, but she was saving the money coming home and patching things up. It is unknown if she ever went to London and unprovable, but privately my opinion is that though legally she could not leave Stratford without her husband’s permission, there was a legal loophole where if another male relative wanted to go and happened to take her with him for whatever reason, that was not illegal.",0

Shakespeare had googly eyes. His nose was a little beaky. He was not the front man of his theatre troupe: that job was Richard Burbage’s. He probably started losing his hair in his late 20s.

He made a few pals in his theatre company like Henry Condell and it is notable that nearly all of them, once they were doing well, treated themselves to expensive real estate outside London. They could never claim noble birth. Neither Elizabeth nor James was in the business of creating titles for a lowly craftsman, either. They were patrolled of those who could flatter them the best. But they could buy a coat of arms and live almost as well as the aristocracy (many of nobles had a place in the city for business and a place in the country for status, if not multiple ones.

Shakespeare dumped his wealth in Stratford, never London, and the more modern thinking is that Anne was his partner in crime, running New Place and being a lady of the manse in Stratford, overseeing business there while Will was a theatre mogul who would schlep home every once in a while in a carriage. So he spent 25 years. In between, Anne and Will’s only boy died young, from the plague. One of the lines in the play King John includes a lament regarding the stillness filling the room of a dead child: why would Shakespeare write about something like that so close to his son’s death in time if he’d never been inside Hamnet’s room? There had to be some sort of relationship between father and son for him even to lament, and though the play is just a play, it is a little too much of a coincidence. No word about how Anne reacted. But it could not have been pretty.",0

Thanks, doll.’ But Greer does suggest, entirely plausibly, that Anne provided the sort of logistical support for her husband - made sure his children were looked after, ran the family home, trivial things like that - that women have done, largely unsung, for millennia. In that sense it’s extremely likely that she helped with his writings. He owed much of his success to his wife.",0

1453429117727162372,"If in The Devil Wears Prada Miranda Priestley says that the beautiful Anne Hathaway is the ""fat and ugly girl"", then I wonder, what the hell am I in this damn world?","1. Her marriage to Tom Cruise - Cruise is an extremely wealthy man. If Holmes didn't want to work, it's a virtual certainty that he wouldn't have forced the issue. In fact, it may have been his preference that she didn't.
2. Her marriage to Tom Cruise #2 - It's clear that from their divorce a few years later, and Holmes’ now long running partnership with actor Jamie Foxx (who she met when he and Cruise were filming the 2004 film Collateral), that her marriage was always in dire straits. Perhaps her decision not to spend months making, and then marketing a film, was an attempt to alleviate the problems in her marriage. Clearly it didn't work.
3. The money may not have been to her liking - It's a certainty that had Holmes returned, she would have been third or fourth in the compensation rolls behind Christian Bale, Heath Ledger and perhaps Gary Oldman. She might have been paid less than her erstwhile costar, Aaron Eckhart. If the money wasn't to her liking, why bother?
4. It wasn't a substantial role - The Dark Knight was Bale and Ledger, with Aaron Eckhart and Gary Oldman getting much of the remaining screentime. The Rachel Dawes role seems to have been an extended cameo, rather than a substantial portion of the narrative. Unless things were changed when the role was recast, it's clear that whoever took it wasn't going to be a leading actor in the film.
5. Perhaps she didn't get along with Chris Nolan - As shocking as it may seem to people who worship at the “altar of Nolan”, he doesn't appeal to a number of people, especially ones who have worked with him. If Holmes didn't enjoy working with him on Batman Begins, why would she take on another project of his? Especially since she had an extremely wealthy husband at the time?
If or when Holmes decides to write her memoirs, then we, the general public, might get an idea. However considering that most people will want to read about her life with Cruise, it's likely that her reasons for turning down The Dark Knight will be a footnote in the book, if that.",0

Come out the other side, and they're suddenly riding in pitch blackness.

A bit before that, during the last few months of 2010, the speculation about who would play Catwoman included frequent mention of Hathaway, and then she was screen testing and fans heard about that, and so on.",0

1453429117727162372,"If in The Devil Wears Prada Miranda Priestley says that the beautiful Anne Hathaway is the ""fat and ugly girl"", then I wonder, what the hell am I in this damn world?","And over the last two-and-a-half years, it has grown and become more and more of a popular sentiment, among a large number of people who probably didn't know they hated her until they heard how widespread the hate against her was. This is a simple fact of human behavior, it's why fads and trends happen, and it drives most of these exact sort of situations. Some famous person starts off beloved or doing well, but then is subjected to a sudden backlash as their popularity and success grows. Then, something happens that eventually ""redeems"" them among the majority of the haters who really weren't true ""haters"" at all, but who in fact were just members of a fad. Actors, musicians, whatever kind of fame there is, there's truth to the saying ""the public is fickle.""",0
1453429117727162372,"If in The Devil Wears Prada Miranda Priestley says that the beautiful Anne Hathaway is the ""fat and ugly girl"", then I wonder, what the hell am I in this damn world?","Why Hathaway and not other stars? There's frankly rarely a rhyme or reason to it, any number of factors just combine with chance and luck to make it happen. For Hathaway, there was the online backlash against her being considered for the role of Catwoman instead of other fanboy favorite actresses, and that caused a steady stream of hate for months, and I think that was a big part of setting off the trend. Then the media talked on and off about the supposed hate, and some of the longer-term Hathaway haters chimed in accusing her of being phoney etc, and that got traction when gossip sites and others kept the story alive, and like any narrrative that takes hold at a given time for some reasons that aren't always clear, this one kept spreading around online and getting repeated until people took it as a truth that there's some big anti-Hathaway sentiment among the broad public -- which there probably is now, because everyone kept repeating it and jumping aboard.",0
1453429117727162372,"If in The Devil Wears Prada Miranda Priestley says that the beautiful Anne Hathaway is the ""fat and ugly girl"", then I wonder, what the hell am I in this damn world?","To those factors I'd add a really important one that has to be considered, too -- people have totally different and contradicting standards by which they judge actresses and actors, and those standards are particularly skewed against young actresses. Few people ever ask the kinds of questions or make the kinds of demands of male actors as they do female actors. A young male actor who is handsome, talented, comes from a family with a history of acting, and who tries to smile a lot and acts nervous and gives speeches or comments that seem too self-serving or rehersed generally get treated like... well, they get treated just fine most of the time, so long as their smile is ""charming"" and they keep being ""handsome"" and ""talented."" Female actors who don't seem ""humble"" enough, however, get quickly labeled cold or stuck-up and other such things, because the attitude is that if a woman isn't humble enough then she's a b****. That's not just a myopic standard applied to actresses, either -- women in almost any profession get treated to similar accusations, and sadly even other women are likely to apply those standards (we're all socialized and educated etc in the same world, after all, so behaviors and attitudes and expectations spread everywhere).",0
1453429117727162372,"If in The Devil Wears Prada Miranda Priestley says that the beautiful Anne Hathaway is the ""fat and ugly girl"", then I wonder, what the hell am I in this damn world?","The vast majority of people with strong opinions against Hathaway have never seen her in real life for even a second, have never spoken to her at all, and their entire experience in assessing her and hating her is based on professional public appearances where she made prepared remarks for a short period of time. That's all, and obviously it's not rationally a basis for any reasonable person to think they have remotely enough experience or information to make a serious informed, intelligent assessment of Hathaway as a human being, unless she turned to the camera and said, ""Minorities should be segregated,"" or some other such actual assertion of morality that speaks to her personality more.",0
1453429117727162372,"If in The Devil Wears Prada Miranda Priestley says that the beautiful Anne Hathaway is the ""fat and ugly girl"", then I wonder, what the hell am I in this damn world?","So the hatred can't really be based on much valid, solid reasoning. It's at best gut feelings that all of her nice, happy, typically positive remarks are all really just ""fake,"" and that this pure guess that she's being disingenuous in her kind remarks and laughter makes her an unlikable person deserving of derision and animosity.",0
1453429117727162372,"If in The Devil Wears Prada Miranda Priestley says that the beautiful Anne Hathaway is the ""fat and ugly girl"", then I wonder, what the hell am I in this damn world?","Does that really sound like a reasonable group attitude that is spread through the public based on each person's reaction to Hathaway, or does it make more sense that the driving force behind the hatred of her for supposedly not seeming sincere enough in her positive words and her smiles is really just another typical fad buoyed by online hype?",0
1453429117727162372,"If in The Devil Wears Prada Miranda Priestley says that the beautiful Anne Hathaway is the ""fat and ugly girl"", then I wonder, what the hell am I in this damn world?","I think it's clearly the latter, and that it'll go away after the press gets bored talking about it. And when people get bored insisting they hate someone they've never met just because her smiles and nice comments don't seem ""true"" enough to them, and/or because she's famous & popular but doesn't act humble enough about it. Or rather, her constant expressions of having a severe self-esteem problem and fear of failure (including self-consciousness about her weight, about bad relationship history, and about comparisons to her mother's expectations) seem ""fake"" and so she's not REALLY humble enough, and is therefore according to her haters fake, unlikeable, stuck-up, etc. That much animosity for pretty much no good reason is hard to maintain, and so Hathaway's redemption will come eventually (maybe soon, since it's peaking right now with her Oscar win and her shocking delivery of a prepared speech at an award ceremony without enough genuine-seeming humility).",0
1453429117727162372,"If in The Devil Wears Prada Miranda Priestley says that the beautiful Anne Hathaway is the ""fat and ugly girl"", then I wonder, what the hell am I in this damn world?","Hathaway might be a cruel person who plucks the hair out of kittens and who sneers at homeless people as her limo drives her home at night. Or she might really care about the issues she's involved with such as gay rights (her brother came out of the closet to her and her family when she was young, resulting in Hathaway changing her religious association), and she might really be nice and might want to be well-liked but might be better at acting on a stage than being herself in front of a room full of people who expect her to act humble lest she be called a cold stuck-up b****. Some people are more comfortable being themselves than others, some people find it easier to express their real feelings than others, some people find it easier to deliver prepared remarks about themselves easier than others. It'd be interesting if the people who hate Hathaway for supposedly being fake and stuck-up and not humble enough etc were to just film themselves for one week, 24 hours a day, and then see if they ever come off as fake or not approachable enough or not humble enough. If they do, will they start a club hating themselves?",0

It’s not like she’s in the papers or always trying to get publicity like say Meghan Markle (Who claimed wanted privacy etc)!

I imagine lots of people think public figures are public property and therefore they are entitled to give an opinion on them when they haven’t done anything controversial to deserve such a thing? Also lots of people are jealous as celebrities get more money and a better lifestyle than they do? Also lastly, good old fashioned sexism when women are always get criticised like ‘ how dare Madonna be over 60 and still dress this way why doesn’t she give up singing and move over for younger generation? How dare Cheryl Cole have dated Liam from one direction who’s more than 10 years younger than her what a cougar! Why doesn’t lady gaga lose weight if she’s going to dance on stage’, etc. It’s stupid and uncalled for! It’s not the same as say ‘how dare Justin Bieber spit on his fans, or Meghan Markle tell lecture others not to waste and think about climate change as she goes about on her private jets, or Amber heard trying to ruin Johnny depps career accusing him of violence when evidence shows she was also abusive etc",0

The men were mean too, but the women were particularly vindictive just because she didn't ""seem approachable"" or ""said hello"" when she first started. Word went round the company was that she was a stuck up beeyotch and a total snob. The truth was, she was scared shitless at starting somewhere new. When she eventually tried to reach out and build a relationship with some of the women, they shat on her even more - apparently it made her fake and annoying. It's hard to change the minds of others when they've already made up their mind about you and aren't willing to change it. It got to her for a bit and affected her work, so she told herself that she didn't care what they thought, she worked hard, loved her job and was excelling at it - she wasn't going to start apologising for her ability. What got her through the day(s) were: ""They hate me because I'm awesome."" Because, really, when everyone is working hard to bring you down, the only way you can stay standing is if you hold yourself up with some semblance of grace. Obviously this doesn't help her campaign in the slightest, the women are working even harder at tearing her to pieces with gossip and baseless complaints to her behaviour.",0

As well as running away from her initial Disney princess image? Intentionally diversifying yourself and your art takes work. Doing random shit to get attention does not. The fame is something she has come to accept as part of her job, but from the way she's carried herself, she's not comfortable with it - hence continuing putting on a show; obviously one that everyone apparently can see right through.",0

She wasn't going to apologise for working damn hard to where she got to, she's secure in her ability and her personality, but isn't secure in her public image.

First of all, how is Lebron not loyal? Let’s actually go over what happened. Lebron signed a rookie contract with Cleveland. He renewed that contract with Cleveland despite the Cavs and Dan Gilbert giving him almost nothing to work with for 7 seasons. He took a Cavs team with Larry Hughes, Zydrunas Ilgauskas, Drew Gooden, Daniel Gibson, Sasha Pavlovic and Eric Snow to the Finals as a 22 year old. He never asked to be traded at any time despite this very weak supporting cast. And he never got a great coach either. He put up with this for 7 seasons before he was eligible for free agency. That 7 year run with Cleveland is already good enough to get his number retired with the team. Remember - Kobe couldn’t even put up with his bad team for even 3 seasons and was constantly asking to be traded in 2007–2008 until the Lakers gave him Pau Gasol.",0

The majority of Lebron hate has come after 2010 because of “The Decision”. This basically ruined Lebron’s good will with the wider fanbase. But let’s take this into perspective; superteams are not a new thing. They’ve been around since the 1960s. Wilt/West/Baylor Lakers was a superteam. Showtime Lakers and Bird Celtics were a superteam. Moses Malone/Dr J 76ers was a superteam. These teams were so stacked they had hall of famers like Bill Walton, Bob McAdoo and Bobby Jones coming off the bench.

The only difference is free agency is of the player’s will and through trades is of the GM’s will. Either way the front office has to sign these players all together in the end. So what I get from this is fans don’t want players to win rings through their own decisions, but through forced decision making. Basically they want the players to suffer to win. Which is such a weird thing to me. In what other sport would the fans prefer the players to suffer than to make their own decisions?",0

It’s not easy to build a team with good chemistry and Lebron’s only been able to do this so many times because everyone knows he’s a great teammate and he elevates everyone around him. That’s why Lebron is able to do this so easily. And superteams don’t guarantee a win for the same reason that all the stars have to play unselfishly and get along well. Lebron is unique in this aspect that regardless of the coach, system or even chemistry (Kyrie and Love were not a good fit chemistry wise for Lebron), he can still get a championship - which he has done for over 40 players. That’s why superteams like the 2004 Lakers, 2013 Lakers and 2020 Clippers all failed is because they didn’t have the team chemistry and Lebron’s unique floor raising abilities.

Everyone flops in the modern NBA from James Harden to Luka Doncic. It’s to take advantage of the rules to get extra points. Every great player utilizes their era specific advantages. Lebron is no different. When you have a chance to get free points, you do it. Of course if Lebron was transported back to the 80s and 90s then he wouldn’t do it, cause the defensive rules were tougher back then. Some fans actually think Lebron - a player with the body of Karl Malone and the speed of Magic Johnson - actually would not survive back then because he’s ‘soft’. This is ridiculous. Lebron is obviously taking advantage of modern day rules, has nothing to do with him being soft. You really think that if you walk up to Lebron on the street and poke him, he’s gonna start crying? get real. And I hate that ‘crybaby meme’ and ‘butterfly meme’ that haters always post on non-related posts. It’s stupid, childish, immature, doesn’t mean anything, and yet always gets the most upvotes. Not just that but they use terms like “Bronsexual” ‘Lebum’ ‘LeChoke’ ‘LeFrozen’ etc it just reinforces the perception that these haters are immature 10 year olds bragging to each other about how funny they are.

The greats were not nearly as overtly deliberate and collusive as LeBron in chasing a ring. A lot of former NBA players did later in their careers, but LeBron has probably played GM at a level and more frequent than any other superstar in history.
2. Flopping / Girly man play. Idc if other players did it. You flop, you’re a woose and bad for the sport, Idc who you are. He’s supposed to be a “great” right? This is a big blemish. I’ve never seen another player flop more than LeBron, sans maybe Ginobili and Chris Paul. That has rubbed a lot of people the wrong way.
3. Slightly overrated. He’s probably Top 3 all time, but he’s still overrated with everyone (i.e. zoomers) calling him the ‘GOAT’ prematurely. The amount of Finals losses is glaring.
4. His personality. He has “Chosen 1” tattoo — I mean, really? He calls himself “King James”. Since day 1 this dude has had an arrogance / air of inevitability / entitlement type of shtick going. Like he accomplished more than he did, before it actually happened. Like he was the GOAT before earning it — and I don’t think he has earned it still.
5. His politics. He bows to China yet causes division in USA.
6. His fans. Probably the most annoying fanbase in the world, sans those BTS fans lmao.

1453411895696924672,"@HowaynShite LeBron James is the most hated athlete in the world and he's the best,they always hate the best.","1. General haters. People tend to hate celebrities who receive a lot of attention. And once someone starts hating a celebrity, it tends to draw more haters.
2. Basketball fans are very protective of their favourite team / player. They tend to only see the strength of their favourite player, and for any other great players who are receiving equal or more attention than his favourite player, only his flaw will be apparent.
3. Superstar treatment. This usually is an excuse from fans from opposing teams when a popular player gets favouritism from referees. On some level, I think it's true (albeit overstated). It also means that the player is always being watched on a microscopic level, every action he takes will be criticised and judge. Personally, I think he is a wonderful person off the court, considering he gone straight to NBA from high school and hasn't had any sex or drug scandal.
4. His flopping. For the readers of there who doesn't know, it means selling the contact by exaggerating to get calls. As a Lebron fan, this bothers me too. Yes, he is so big and strong and if he doesn't flop a little he would get less calls. But still, I really dislike the moment players start complaining to the referees in game. It looks really unprofessional.
5. The Decision. Lebron James has changed the destiny of Cleveland when he was selected as the first pick. Despite not winning a championship with them (yet), he turned a lottery team into a playoff team. In 2010, when he was a free agent, he decided to leave Cleveland and join his 2 other superstar buddies to form a superteam, and he announced this decision on a special program on TV which made many, many fans angry, even though it raised a lot of money for some children charity. For some reason, people seem to think like a player should stay with his team forever, even though they have the right to leave.
6. LeBron, along with many other superstar players, has attracted plenty of so called bandwagon fans, which refers to fans who are not loyal and likes whichever team is winning (or has the highest chance to win). By definition, I am a bandwagon fan. I don't live in America, and I only started watching basketball when I realised I could learn a lot from watching. I love all good players and good teams.
7. The MJ comparison. Michael Jordan has been recognised as the Greatest of All Time (G.O.A.T) for a while. He has established a fanbase that refuses to accept the fact that he might be replaced by someone else, some day. I have only watched him on YouTube videos, and no doubt that LeBron and him are 2 of the best players who stepped on the court. Enough with the debate, people. Just appreciate great basketball.",0

1453411895696924672,"@HowaynShite LeBron James is the most hated athlete in the world and he's the best,they always hate the best.","1. He is very self-congratulatory and self promoting. He still does things to get affirmation, like wearing shoes that say “I am King.” It is his 15th year in the league. He shouldn’t need to pat himself on the back so hard. He might break his arm or something. He was asked who should win the MVP for 2017–2018. He said himself, then did a short promo on why. He has also proclaimed himself, “The Chosen One”. I don’t expect players that rich, popular, or talented to be humble, but he has taken it to another level.
2. The Decision. LeBron ensured that he would never get another free pass in the GOAT discussion when he “took his talents to South Beach”. He picked a great organization, surrounded himself with hall of fame talent, and promised at least 7–8 championships after leaving Cleveland feeling so cold and lonely. And bitter. They burned his jersey, sure, but most people who didn’t have such personal feelings about it, felt that LeBron, a once-in-a-generation player, gave himself some towering advantages over other players in the league and from other eras. He got to pick his team, his conference, his climate, and his destiny. Four finals and two championships later he had had enough and decided to take his talents back to Cleveland.
3. The instability. Call it arrogance. Call it restlessness. But LeBron gives off the vibe that he can do whatever he wants, go wherever he wants, and change his mind at his leisure. Don’t get me wrong. It is his prerogative. But he has disappointed a lot of people in Cleveland and Miami. And now he has refused to definitively squash rumors that he is still planning to leave Cleveland for a second time. Papa must be a rolling stone. Why do so many of his teams crash and burn when he leaves? Is it because of his value? Or is it because he has created instability with his refusal to commit himself? His rash decisions have hurt his current team. The Cavs are seeded a super low 4th. LeBron’s path out of the East will be the toughest since Cleveland had won a conference title and played for the championship that first time. He could have stayed and brought pressure to the Cleveland front office. Still, he left and had a stellar time in Miami.
4. Social Media. Social media will kill the image of anybody, and often does. No matter how famous or popular, indeed sometimes because of how famous and popular, people can and will get taken down a peg. LeBron was low hanging fruit for many people who love to hate. He is a victim of today’s speed-of-light grapevine.",0

You can dribble like Steph Curry. Steph’s handle is achieved mostly through hours of practice which you could do. In fact, a little kid imitated Steph’s pre-game ball handling routine. In essence, it would be very difficult, and almost nobody would put themselves through it, but you could become like Steph Curry.

Forget the Decision, his pep rally right after he was lambasted, instead of laying low, he's saying “not 5, not 6, not 7, …”. On the court, he can be hard to watch with his defensive flopping, complaining to refs to where he looks like he might cry, standing around on defense then yelling at teammates when his guy hits a three, or throwing a temper tantrum after JR Smith makes a boneheaded play rather than trying to regroup and win in OT.",0

Most people rank him #2 all-time, which I could see a debate between LeBron, Kareem, Magic and Bill Russell for the #2 spot, so there can be more of a case that he's slightly overrated. He just doesn't have the body of work to compete with Jordan, who ranks #1 in PER and WS/48, despite playing before the modern analytics era which has most of the top ranking players. Jordan's never come up small on the biggest stage, in an NBA Finals, and has never lost a playoff series where they were the favorites (which LeBron has done a few times). Jordan simply dominated his contemporaries on a completely different level than anyone ever. Jordan also played for the ultimate superteam in terms of results, despite the relative lack of all-stars on the roster and dismissed by far more all-time teams than anyone (teams with 75+ wins in regular season + playoffs).",0

Whereas Kobe gets absolutely no blame for getting swept in 2011 to the same Dallas Mavs team - and FYI guarded by Jason Terry (who actually guarded Kobe, not Lebron since he’s an SG) - that people criticized Lebron for losing to in 6 games.

It’s also implying that losing before the Finals would actually be better in order to preserve the Finals record - but that idea is blatantly ridiculous, as anyone who has played sports knows.

-Lebron habitually beat their favorite teams (usually the Raptors or Celtics but pretty much any team since Lebron has a winning record against almost every team)
-Lebron is too political
-They blame Lebron for all of the modern NBA’s problems like flopping and superteams
-Recency bias. Lebron is fresh in people’s memories, and whatever he does on the court (or even off the court - I even read some posts where people blamed Lebron for Nike’s sweatshops, said he was a communist sympathizer and letting his son smoke weed which is ridiculous) is scrutinized unlike any other player before.

They forget how hard it is to even make the playoffs let alone reach the Finals. LeBron has been considered #1 in the world for quite some time now (likely since 2007) and media, fans, other players, former players, etc. held him to that standard. I’m always one to admit that he shrank in 2011, but the Heat don’t even get that far without him either. He was 26 years old and it was his second trip to the Finals and the chemistry wasn’t completely there. He let the Mavs get in his head and that costs him a chance at another championship. In 2007, he was at a complete disadvantage playing against 3 HOFers and their HOF head coach with a bunch of no names like Iverson did against LA in 2001. In 2014, the Spurs were gunning for the Miami Heat hard after their loss to them the year prior. D-Wade was unhealthy and so was Bosh and with the Spurs seeing red, it spelled bad news for LeBron and co. Yet and still, LeBron performed when they needed him to. He scored 9 pts. in 51 seconds and kept the Heat from being swept, but since they got beaten in 5 games by the widest margin of victory, people just pointed at that and placed it all on LeBron. 2015, no Kyrie and Kevin Love against 3 All-Stars yet he ended up leading both teams in 3 categories. He still pushed Golden State to 6 games which wasn’t an easy task especially with an unhealthy Dellavedova as his 2nd best available player. In 2017, those same Warriors added #2 best player in Kevin Durant to their already stacked roster and people still thought LeBron had a chance. 2018 was basically the same, but worse without Kyrie and then getting swept again. They only talked about the ones he lost and not what he did in the ones he won. If he had a Kareem, a Pippen, a Shaq, D-Wade & Bosh, or Irving and Love as well as a competent head coach like Pop and Zen Master, it’d be a whole other story.

1453411895696924672,"@HowaynShite LeBron James is the most hated athlete in the world and he's the best,they always hate the best.","1. The Decision. It was done in an arrogant manner, and many fans just can’t get beyond it.
2. There is tremendous competition between fans of LeBron and fans of Kobe. Kobe’s fans, especially those on the Internet, are the most strident fans of NBA players I’ve ever seen. LeBron and Duncan are the main competitors with Kobe for the best player of the 21st century. This competition gets transferred into hate.
3. I’ve seen Kobe’s fans dump on Jerry West. Jerry last retired 42 years ago. But West’s crime was that he was a strong rival to Kobe for the choice of the most popular Laker. Of course, they have almost as much hatred for Tim Duncan as they do LeBron. Duncan’s career overlapped more tightly with Kobe’s career than LeBron’s. Duncan is known to be non-controversial. But Duncan is also a major rival to Kobe for the choice of best player of the first decade of the 21st century.
4. Above and beyond all this competition, LeBron is a phenomenal player. He is outstanding in just about every aspect of the game. This may cause resentment, which may in turn lead to hate.
5. LeBron is a very aggressive player as far as orchestrating the game on the court. And he has also orchestrated the selection of the team’s players- in two or even three franchises. There may be resentment for a player, no matter now talented, seeming to assume a role normally performed by a team executive, not a player.",0

First of all, how is Lebron not loyal? Let’s actually go over what happened. Lebron signed a rookie contract with Cleveland. He renewed that contract with Cleveland despite the Cavs and Dan Gilbert giving him almost nothing to work with for 7 seasons. He took a Cavs team with Larry Hughes, Zydrunas Ilgauskas, Drew Gooden, Daniel Gibson, Sasha Pavlovic and Eric Snow to the Finals as a 22 year old. He never asked to be traded at any time despite this very weak supporting cast. And he never got a great coach either. He put up with this for 7 seasons before he was eligible for free agency. That 7 year run with Cleveland is already good enough to get his number retired with the team. Remember - Kobe couldn’t even put up with his bad team for even 3 seasons and was constantly asking to be traded in 2007–2008 until the Lakers gave him Pau Gasol.",0

The majority of Lebron hate has come after 2010 because of “The Decision”. This basically ruined Lebron’s good will with the wider fanbase. But let’s take this into perspective; superteams are not a new thing. They’ve been around since the 1960s. Wilt/West/Baylor Lakers was a superteam. Showtime Lakers and Bird Celtics were a superteam. Moses Malone/Dr J 76ers was a superteam. These teams were so stacked they had hall of famers like Bill Walton, Bob McAdoo and Bobby Jones coming off the bench.

The only difference is free agency is of the player’s will and through trades is of the GM’s will. Either way the front office has to sign these players all together in the end. So what I get from this is fans don’t want players to win rings through their own decisions, but through forced decision making. Basically they want the players to suffer to win. Which is such a weird thing to me. In what other sport would the fans prefer the players to suffer than to make their own decisions?",0

It’s not easy to build a team with good chemistry and Lebron’s only been able to do this so many times because everyone knows he’s a great teammate and he elevates everyone around him. That’s why Lebron is able to do this so easily. And superteams don’t guarantee a win for the same reason that all the stars have to play unselfishly and get along well. Lebron is unique in this aspect that regardless of the coach, system or even chemistry (Kyrie and Love were not a good fit chemistry wise for Lebron), he can still get a championship - which he has done for over 40 players. That’s why superteams like the 2004 Lakers, 2013 Lakers and 2020 Clippers all failed is because they didn’t have the team chemistry and Lebron’s unique floor raising abilities.

Everyone flops in the modern NBA from James Harden to Luka Doncic. It’s to take advantage of the rules to get extra points. Every great player utilizes their era specific advantages. Lebron is no different. When you have a chance to get free points, you do it. Of course if Lebron was transported back to the 80s and 90s then he wouldn’t do it, cause the defensive rules were tougher back then. Some fans actually think Lebron - a player with the body of Karl Malone and the speed of Magic Johnson - actually would not survive back then because he’s ‘soft’. This is ridiculous. Lebron is obviously taking advantage of modern day rules, has nothing to do with him being soft. You really think that if you walk up to Lebron on the street and poke him, he’s gonna start crying? get real. And I hate that ‘crybaby meme’ and ‘butterfly meme’ that haters always post on non-related posts. It’s stupid, childish, immature, doesn’t mean anything, and yet always gets the most upvotes. Not just that but they use terms like “Bronsexual” ‘Lebum’ ‘LeChoke’ ‘LeFrozen’ etc it just reinforces the perception that these haters are immature 10 year olds bragging to each other about how funny they are.

This is my favourite song from Kanye’s 2010 album My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. It’s not a 4 minute danceable pop-rap tune. It’s 8 minutes long; the beat is dark cello over a haunting Aphex Twin piano sample, while Kanye gets into his feelings about fame and about his ex. Also features a filthy, funny Chris Rock skit.",0
1453359106136358916,Bruh Kanye west is fucking goat,"(The key to appreciating production is to stop telling yourself the lie that producing is easy. It’s easy to say, “I could have done that—he didn’t even write the piano sample!” But that would be lying to yourself. Having an ear for noticing a small piece of music you could reuse, and knowing how to reuse it so that it sounds good in a new way, is itself a skill. You wouldn’t have thought to make the piano slightly more lo-fi; to put that cello line on top of it; to choose John Legend’s voice for the chorus specifically; to have your rapping looser than usual and sometimes distorted, communicating how in your feels you are; or to call up Chris Rock asking for a skit. They fit together perfectly, and that’s hard to do.)",0
1453359106136358916,Bruh Kanye west is fucking goat,"I mean part of the reason it sounds like a lot of what is on the radio is because he was a huge influence on the artist who are on the radio. He has changed rap and mainstream music massively, so while his music might seem formulaic at time thats only because the formula is largely based on his music. He’s consistently creative, pushing boundaries and changing his field massively which I would say is a pretty good reason to call someone a great artist. His albums The College Dropout, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy and Late Registration (and most if his others to) are some of the most creative, incredible and timeless rap albums, but thats just in my opinion. He’s also a very talented rapper when he wants to be, you can see this on songs like No More Parties in LA, Gorgeous or Dark Fantasy for example. Thats just what I think though.",0

Keep in mind that Stevie Wonder played almost all instruments on his songs, and self-produced and arranged everything, or that Paul McCartney is famed for literally playing every instrument on many of his albums. Marvin Gaye did this, as well, recording back-up vocals, piano and even directing and conducting the whole group. Kanye cannot do this. Yet Kanye calls himself a “genius”!",0

But in a world in which women are often dismissed, paid less, treated like prostitutes, or raped, and face harassment and discrimination at work (especially in all-male workplaces), this kind of sexism is not funny. And, BTW, it is possible to write sexy lyrics that are not sexist! Just check out Marvin Gaye!

1453359106136358916,Bruh Kanye west is fucking goat,"Also, his music long ago started shifting, moving away from what it once was, music that appealed to backpackers and music that seemed to speak to a black audience specifically. Now, his music seems to be more geared toward European clubs and a different audience, he once admitted to having the Olsen twins listen to his music, because the audience he sort were “white girls”, and he speaks to no one but his own ego.

Any teenager can take a pop baseline, and attach it to a beat. I guess a lot of people don't know that that is essentially what modern hip hop has devolved into, taking pop music, and adding a hook.

Trump cost Republicans the Senate as he spent 2 months trying to overturn a state election whose Electoral College votes didn’t even matter in the final tally. Democrats did 3 to 8% better in the run-off against Republicans in counties that Loeffler and Perdue won and they maintained their large margins in big urban areas. That would indicate Republican turnout was dampened. Telling everyone the Governor and election officials they voted for are corrupt idiots will do that to voter enthusiasm. There was also this weird issue where Republicans had to pull their punches in advertising. How do you warn voters that we need a GOP Senate to thwart the new Biden administration if you can’t even say “Biden administration” without getting a mean Trump tweet?,0

A race where the weaker of the two Democrats is a 33 year old Jewish documentary film maker who has never held public office running against a well liked incumbent whose cousin was a very popular Governor. Warnock was always going to win against the very weak Loeffler, but tens of thousands voters split their party choices, so it’s reasonable to suspect Perdue wins if Trump stays out of the race.",0

I agree with him on many issues, but you simply cannot blame the left wing of the American political spectrum for partisan divisions when you’ve been stoking them for a large portion of your political career. He shares a large character flaw with many right wingers right now - just an overall lack of integrity. He advocates for a larger amount of campaign funds in politics because “[he] wants to win.” He blames past democratic administrations for foreign policy blunders in the Mid-East, when it is very much a fallacious standpoint to take to blame the actions of one political party for a complex topic (it’s probably 65%/35%, reps. and dems., respectively). He restricts abortion access (which I agree that abortion is morally wrong) but turns a blind eye to foreign and domestic human rights abuses (Uighur genocide, Rohingya cleansing, U.S. southern border situation). He falsely associates the expansion of the welfare state in the late 70s and early 80s with the socioeconomic disenfranchisement of black and brown communities (c.c. the Iran-Contra Affair, which introduced the drug trade into U.S. urban areas; it was transparently the responsibility of the Reagan administration and was swept under the rug by Bill Barr under Bush 41). I think McCain, despite his flaws, was the last civilized conservative politician. At least I think that would be the viewpoint of Democratic-Republican leaders if someone transported Clay, Calhoun, et al. to the future.

1453328370809274370,who wants to eat my butthole  Kim is a fat lady,"If you were born after 1991, you’ve never known a time when pregnancy wasn’t performed in public: 1991 was the watershed year in which Demi Moore appeared naked, seven months pregnant with her second daughter, Scout, on the cover of Vanity Fair. The cover became instantly iconic, mocked and replicated and spoofed in the manner of meme culture decades before online memes existed. In some quarters, it was considered obscene: many supermarkets displayed it with the sort of paper wrap reserved for Playboy; others, like Safeway and Giant, refused to sell it entirely. “It’s tacky,” one twenty-​­three-​­year-​­old woman told the Los Angeles Times. She couldn’t imagine “why anyone would want to display her swollen stomach like that — and why people would want to look at it.” The titillation was purposeful: Vanity Fair editor Tina Brown, who would go on to serve as editor in chief of The New Yorker, made the decision to put the image on the cover, knowing how it would drive sales. The issue ended up selling more than a million copies — 250,000 more than normal circulation. “The Demi Moore cover is a radical statement of New Hollywood values,” Brown declared. “It breaks the mold of every stereotype of celebrity glamour. For too long, women have felt that pregnancy is something they have to conceal and disguise. It takes the courage of a woman as modern and innovative as Demi Moore to cast aside the conventions of traditional beauty and declare that there is nothing more glorious than the sight of a woman carrying a child.” Moore, who was promoting her new movie, The Butcher’s Wife, obviously agreed. “I have no regrets,” she said. “Attitudes are changing. I feel beautiful when I’m pregnant . . . I was just on vacation in Mexico, in my bikini with my big belly hanging out and my low-​­cut top.” Even before the shoot, Moore’s attitude had been catching on: swimsuit designer John Koerner reported that his maternity bikini, released three years before, was now his number one seller. “Women’s whole attitude toward pregnancy is changing fast,” he explained. “It’s what we call a paradigm shift — none of the old rules apply.” It’s taken twenty-​­five years to see just how right Koerner’s statement would be. Today, pregnancy and motherhood are one of the primary ways in which a female celebrity maintains attention. The baby bump has become, as Molly Jong-​­Fast declared in The New York Times, the new Birkin bag: it’s “cute” and “adorable” and “feminine,” something to dress up, to rub in photos, to have photographed as your partner leans down and kisses it. Celebrities model these behaviors on the red carpet, in selfies, and in paparazzi photos, and as a result, women across America have adopted them en masse. It’s difficult to emphasize just how radical this attitude would seem to women experiencing pregnancy even thirty years ago. To be pregnant in public was in poor taste — unsophisticated, trashy, unbecoming, obscene. That sense of the pregnant body as abject goes back millennia, as the pregnant body is a woman’s body at its most fecund, but also in its most grotesque figuration: the body swells, expands, and oozes, the boundary between inside and outside permeable. New motherhood is often depicted as something darling: sweetly sleeping babies on all crisp white sheets and gurgling babies in the bath. But childbirth is a messy, primal process: consider the afterbirth, the leakage of breast milk, the caked gunk scraped from the newborn’s body, the blood and screaming, and the fact that for so long, so many otherwise healthy women died in the process of giving birth. The pregnant body was also profoundly contradictory: as scholar Jane Ussher explains, pregnancy is, at its most essential, the most vivid proof of women’s sexuality — which is precisely why representations of mothers took on the opposite characteristics. The most significant mother of Christianity, for example, is the Virgin Mary: asexual, idealized, immaculate. Mary is rarely represented while actually pregnant, only afterwards, when the child is safely born, both mother and child clean and content. This beatific mother is contained, pure — the antidote to the abjectly pregnant mother. Historically, the easiest way to contain that abjection was to keep the pregnancy out of sight. Women of a certain class often receded entirely from public view until after the baby was born and the visible signs of pregnancy had diminished. When the birth occurred, it happened in the domestic space and was managed by midwives. Like all things hidden for fear of abjection (women’s sexuality, menstrual periods, feces), it became societally unacceptable to even speak openly of pregnancy: according to historian Carol Brooks Gardner, in nineteenth-​­century America “talk of pregnancy was forbidden even between mother and daughter, if either hoped to claim breeding and gentility.” Colloquialisms were developed to refer tactfully to the obscenity of a woman’s condition: she was “with child” or “in a family way,” never “pregnant.” Up until the 1950s, the word “pregnancy” was not even allowed on‑screen. In 1953, the Motion Picture Association of America refused to approve the script for The Moon Is Blue because it included the word “pregnant”; the MPAA’s list of “13 Don’ts and 31 Be Carefuls,” which determined what could and could not make its way on‑screen from the 1920s to the 1960s, included a ban on any depiction of childbirth, even “in silhouette.” In silent film–era Hollywood, most stars avoided motherhood in one way or another so as to sustain their marketability; those who did become pregnant removed themselves from public view, even as the studios offered access to all other parts of the stars’ homes and family life. As late as the 1950s, stars like Elizabeth Taylor and Debbie Reynolds were seldom photographed while pregnant — just during the blissful, bonding aftermath. The attempt to erase pregnant bodies from the public sphere took place alongside women’s increased freedom to control when they became pregnant. In 1965, the Supreme Court upheld the right to privacy when it came to birth control; in 1973, it protected the right to access abortion services in Roe v. Wade; a year later, the court denied a Cleveland school the right to ban a pregnant teacher from continuing to work when the administration “worried that her pregnant body would alternately disgust, concern, fascinate, and embarrass her students.” As legal scholar Renée Ann Cramer points out, these decisions “set the stage for openness to the bump, and pregnancy, that we have today.” The idea that women shouldn’t work while pregnant, after all, is predicated on the fact that women would have some other source of income while absent from the workforce. In many ways, the decision of the court underlined that this was no longer, or could no longer be expected to be, the case. Even after the Supreme Court ruling, pregnant women were largely exempted from having to perform the same sort of femininity and body surveillance that accompanied their non-​pregnant existences — in part because they were not yet considered a lucrative market. Put differently, industries weren’t yet selling the idea of the “cute” pregnancy — or the products to maintain it. There was no maternity yoga; no maternity Spanx. Maternity clothes were largely hideous and/or homemade, making “pregnancy style” an oxymoron: even Princess Diana, whose early 1980s pregnancies were arguably the most visible in history, still dressed in what might best be described as polka-​­dotted baby doll dresses. But the popularization of spandex and Lycra in the 1980s and ’90s changed all that: a fabric that could stretch was one that could be crafted into something (relatively) cute for the growing pregnant body.",0
1453328370809274370,who wants to eat my butthole  Kim is a fat lady,"Before Moore, the paparazzi generally respected the boundaries of the pregnant female celebrity (even Madonna, who’d so willingly embraced public documentation of her body throughout her career, remained largely unphotographed during her first pregnancy). All",0
1453328370809274370,who wants to eat my butthole  Kim is a fat lady,"that changed within the decade — when the combination of digital photography and Us Weekly not only created a market for pregnancy photos, but helped turn “bump watch,” and the cultivation of the “cute pregnancy,” into one of the female celebrity’s primary modes of publicity. Suddenly, the taboo of the pregnant body turned into a spectacle that could be stylized, exploited, scrutinized, and interpreted as emblematic of a woman’s overarching success or failure. Janice Min dates the shift to around 2003, when she had just taken over the reins of Us Weekly from Bonnie Fuller, who’d turned the long-​­flailing magazine around. “Not only were an unprecedented number of top actresses suddenly pregnant ([Courteney] Cox, [Brooke] Shields, [Gwyneth] Paltrow, [Debra] Messing, [Denise] Richards, to name a few),” Min explains, “but they were — for the first time in history — well, flaunting it.” Min lists all the products that had become associated with pregnancy — the Bugaboo stroller, designer cribs, the Bikram yoga post-​­pregnancy workout routine — before declaring “the once frumpy bump industry was suddenly big business.” And with the availability of the means to create a “cute” pregnancy came the compulsion for all women, celebrity or not, to do so. Min points to the ways other companies were making money off the “bump industry,” but it was huge business for her own magazine — in part because it fit its ethos of “Just Like Us.” Us Weekly had become a genuine competitor to People through its reliance on paparazzi photos — of stars doing mundane things like grocery shopping and pumping gas — that cost very little. In the process, it effectively created a market for photos of celebrities in all aspects of their lives outside of the home. Even more valuable, though, were shots of female celebrities performing these tasks while pregnant. The pregnant celebrity body is the perfect consolidation of “Just Like Us” and “Nothing Like Us,” the mundane and the spectacular: it doesn’t matter what the celebrity and her body are doing, because her body’s growing. And like the aging process or weight gain, that process, and how a celebrity chooses to embrace or conceal it, is one of the most perversely engrossing images to observe. All of this — Us Weekly, Demi Moore, fashionable baby clothes, surveillance of celebrities that translates into their own hyper‑vigilant surveillance of self — funnels toward Kim Kardashian, the most important and influential celebrity of the twenty-​­first century. Paris Hilton understood that power (initially, through her sex tape; afterwards, through The Simple Life) at the beginning of the 2000s, but Kardashian — who established herself as part of Hilton’s circle by volunteering to organize her closet for her — was observing her closely. Then she beat Hilton at her own game: with the help of her “momager,” Kris, and her extensive, blended family, Kardashian transformed the banalities of “everyday” life, and the surveillance thereof, into a narrative far more gripping than most reality television.",0
1453328370809274370,who wants to eat my butthole  Kim is a fat lady,"In 2013, Keeping Up with the Kardashians was entering its eighth season. The family had never been more popular: Kourtney had given birth to two children, the gestations of whom were incorporated into the show; Khloé was in her fourth year of marriage to basketball player Lamar Odom; Rob had launched a successful sock line; Kendall and Kylie Jenner had their own clothing line for Pacific Sunwear; Kendall was embarking on the beginning of her career as a model. And Kim — who had married and separated from basketball player Kris Humphries and started dating Kanye West, all within the span of two years — had never been more surveilled or valuable. When Kanye announced Kim’s pregnancy on December 30, 2012, it felt sudden — largely because Kim’s divorce from Humphries had yet to be finalized. Yet in addition to whatever personal feelings Kim might have had at the prospect of becoming a mother, she also understood the pregnancy in terms of marketability. When your body and personal life are the source of not just your fame, but your income, that’s not callous so much as the new corporeal due diligence. But Kardashian’s pregnancy refused to make itself marketable — at least not in the way she envisioned it. If, before, women had to hide from public view, today, the bump is imagined as “a new freedom” — not an “embarrassing or abject physical state,” as Imogen Tyler explains, “but an opportunity to have a different fashionable and sexy body shape.” But the actual liberating power of what Tyler calls “pregnant beauty” is dubious, in part because there’s really only one acceptable way for it to manifest. Min describes that model, demonstrated en masse by celebrities, as “one day you’d look as though you swallowed a basketball. The next day it would be gone.” There’s no swelling, no barfing, no hemorrhoids, nothing abject about this pregnancy experience: you feel great, and you talk about feeling great, and everyone knows you feel great. Kim herself admits to buying into this understanding: as she says, on camera, late in her third trimester, “I always envisioned [that] only my belly would get big.”",0
1453328370809274370,who wants to eat my butthole  Kim is a fat lady,"Yet Kardashian’s pregnancy failed to fulfill that vision of pregnant beauty on both a physical and an emotional level. In the first episode of season eight of Keeping Up with the Kardashians, when Kris accompanies Kim to a sonogram appointment, she exclaims, “I’m more excited than she is,” a point driven home when Kim doesn’t even want to see a picture of the sonogram. Kim avers that “once I start showing I’ll get excited.” Once the bump appears, or, in other words, once she’s able to style it and make it available for public consumption — that’s when she’ll start enjoying pregnancy. Kardashian’s anxiety over the “in‑between” time — from when a woman knows she’s pregnant to when her body strongly signifies as such — is widely held. Few things in American society, after all, are considered as terrifying as getting fat, and with good reason: for most people, fatness means a harder time getting a job, garnering respect, or navigating the physical world; for celebrities, it means all of those things, plus incessant public ridicule. And as the cult of the baby bump developed, so, too, did the idealized post-​­baby body — one that, just months after giving birth, looks exactly as it did before pregnancy. Which is part of the reason that Kim, who was thirty-​­two when she became pregnant, was anxious: “Our parents had us in their twenties and their bodies bounced back,” she tells one of her sisters. “My mom had Kendall and Kylie in her forties and she still can’t lose the weight.” She was not only nervous that her body would, in its early pregnant state, signify as fat, but that whatever weight she gained would haunt her in the future. It makes sense that women’s inclination toward disordered eating spikes so sharply during and after pregnancy: that’s how strongly weight gain of any kind, even related to pregnancy, is stigmatized. But as Kardashian’s pregnancy became unequivocal, the rest of her body refused to conform to the cute ideal she’d internalized. Her feet, like the rest of her body, began to swell — early indicators of what would later be diagnosed as preeclampsia. She yearned for the body that hid beneath her pregnant one: when brother‑in‑law Scott Disick walked in on her in pregnancy Spanx, he exclaimed, “Your voluptuous pregnant body shouldn’t be in bike shorts around people,” to which Kardashian responded, “It’s less attractive than my skinny toned body . . . Can we just reminisce for a second?” Over the course of that one scene, Disick tells her: “You’re gonna get back there”; “Your boobs are getting a little big for you to do that”; “How big is that baby”; “You look like the Nutty Professor.” It’s the sort of contradictory messaging a pregnant woman receives: you’re hot, but on the border of obscene; you’re perfect, but you’re huge; don’t feel bad about yourself, but your thin body is better.",0
1453328370809274370,who wants to eat my butthole  Kim is a fat lady,"There was another part of the pregnancy picture that Kim hadn’t anticipated: ridicule at the hands of the press. The comparison to a killer whale soon joined pictures of her feet, swelling painfully out of her high heels. At the beginning of episode five, Rob greets Kim with “What’s up, fat feet?” clearly alluding to her coverage in the press. It’s one of dozens of moments, interspersed throughout the season, that highlight the ways in which coverage of their celebrity outside of the show disrupts the illusion of the hermetically sealed Kardashian world. It’s also one of the unspoken allures of the show: viewers are essentially watching celebrities react, respond, and oftentimes alter their behavior based on how they’re covered in the press. It’s a window, in other words, into the highly reactive, yet usually invisible, production of celebrity. What’s fascinating about Kardashian’s pregnancy, then, is how she refused to allow her changing body to be policed by it — especially when it came to fashion. Maternity wear has become a $2.4 billion business, with thousands of options for every pregnant body, yet there’s still an unspoken demarcation of “appropriate” maternity fashion. It can be feminine and flirty, but shouldn’t be slutty or sexual; you can show your bare belly at the pool, but not in any other circumstance. And when you begin to show, you should wear clothes designed specifically for maternity wear. Kardashian ignored each of those rules. She’d always worn clingy dresses, so she kept wearing them. She’d always shown skin, so she kept showing it — outfits with see-through mesh strips, short dresses that showed off her legs, low-​­plunging necklines that revealed her substantial cleavage, high-​­waisted pencil skirts that broadened, rather than hid, her girth. She kept wearing heels, and full makeup, and “body-​­con” dresses, performing femininity and sexuality the same way she had her entire celebrity career. Those decisions were met with disgust: “Would someone please tell Kim she’s pregnant!” the cover of the New York Post screamed, along with a picture of Kardashian in a high-​­waisted, flared dress. Us Weekly called her style “controversial”; People explained that the “tough and edgy” style of one outfit was “usually reserved for non-​­pregnancy moments.” “We give you a woman at the tail end of her pregnancy who refuses to ditch the Rich Bitch bodycon dresses, hose, and sky-​­high heels,” VH1 declared. “What is she trying to prove? And to whom is she trying to prove it? We’d love her more if she rolled out in yoga pants, toe socks, and pigtails. She’s eighteen months pregnant.” What was Kardashian trying to prove? That there are myriad ways to clothe a pregnant body. That the way you feel sexy in your own body doesn’t have to change when you get pregnant. That even at “eighteen months pregnant,” she’d actually be shamed, in some capacity, for “rolling out” in yoga pants and pigtails. If she tried to keep the baby healthy, she was too fat. If she put on a dress that made her feel attractive, she was too sexy.",0
1453328370809274370,who wants to eat my butthole  Kim is a fat lady,"Take, for example, the skintight floral dress she wore to the Met Ball — which purportedly prompted Anna Wintour to cut her out of Vogue’s coverage of the event. Wintour’s move made sense, in a messed‑up way: Vogue is a fashion magazine, but it’s also a policer of class, and Kardashian’s pregnancy troubled the magazine’s trenchant distinctions between high and low. Not just in her body’s inability to hew to the ideal of the basketball bump, but also in Kardashian’s conception of how to dress it. Just look at the language used, across the press, to describe her style: “Kim isn’t shy about showing off her cleavage,” “never one to keep things simple,” “overly-​opulent,” and “disastrous”; “illusion netting, feathers, leather leggings — any one of these items would be over the top,” OK! magazine declared, “but of course Kim feels no fashion fear.” She spilled out of her dresses; she purportedly broke zippers: her flesh was too ample, too much. She tried too hard. Coded language, all of it, for a disrespect of the boundaries that separate class from trash — a distinction that has afflicted Kardashian from the beginning of her career, first because of her association with a sex tape (tawdry) and then for her affiliation with reality television (lowbrow). That’s why Wintour famously would only allow her on the cover of Vogue with Kanye. It doesn’t matter that Kardashian grew up rich, or that she currently pulls in more than $100 million a year: she’ll always be perceived as new money, and her fame will always be centered on her body and, as such, easily dismissed and delegitimized. It was easy to code Kardashian’s pregnancy in the same manner as her career — especially when it played out in near-synchronization with that of the Duchess of Cambridge, popularly known as Kate Middleton. As novelist and cultural critic Hilary Mantel explains, “Kate seems to have been selected for her role of princess because she was irreproachable: as painfully thin as anyone could wish, without quirks, without oddities, without the risk of the emergence of character.” She was, plainly put, incredibly, wonderfully, perfectly palatable. Fashion scholar Maureen Brewster points out that Middleton’s style “relied heavily upon knee-​­length dresses cut in A‑line with Empire waistlines” that “also displayed her as very clearly slim despite her growing bump, further establishing her pregnancy as a fit and fashionable performance.”",0
1453328370809274370,who wants to eat my butthole  Kim is a fat lady,"No matter that her slimness was due to her hyperemesis gravidarum, also known as acute morning sickness, for which she was hospitalized early in her pregnancy — Middleton’s classy, contained bump incited approving commentary from People’s “Style Watch” Facebook page: “Very classy & pretty”; “Simple and elegant!”; “Pregnancy suits her very well! She looks beautiful.” The opposite, in other words, of Kardashian. If Middleton’s body was impossible to interpret as fat, Kim’s always threatened to be read as such; if Middleton’s style was feminine and classy, Kardashian’s was whorish and trashy. The contrast was made explicit in photo spreads throughout the pair’s pregnancies: “often, the slimmer star was portrayed as the most able to police her desires to eat and grow large,” Cramer explains, as “the press valorizes the women most able to exhibit self-control while pregnant.” It didn’t matter that Kardashian was carefully monitoring her diet: the tabloids claimed not only that she “couldn’t stop eating,” but that she was doing it on purpose so as to then strike a deal with a weight-​­loss company after the birth of her daughter. One magazine said she’d gained “65 pounds” through “binges”; another put her at more than two hundred pounds through “waffle cones and fries.” Keeping Up with the Kardashians features a handful of scenes in which Kim “indulges”: in one, she eats mozzarella sticks; in another, she eats fries with her brother. But the vast majority of the time she’s filmed eating the same boxed green salads and chef-​­prepared meals as the rest of her family. “All I eat is carrots, and celery and ranch, and like, protein bars, gluten-​­free stuff, sugar-free stuff,” she told Maria Menounos in an interview on Extra. “I am waiting for the moments when someone’s like, go to McDonald’s and Taco Bell [but] that’s not happening for me.” If she were to go to those places, the paparazzi would be waiting for her. After the “whale photo” went viral, unflattering images — any shot of Kim eating, looking fat, or in situations that could be construed as overindulging or disgusted at her own body — were at a premium. When she arrives at a frozen yogurt shop to meet with her stepbrother Brandon and his wife, Leah, in a midseason episode, the paparazzi swarms the windows, forcing Kim to hide behind Brandon as she attempts to get a taste of yogurt. “I’ll get like a sample and they’ll be like, ‘she’s five hundred pounds, she’s trying like a million yogurts!’” she explained. When, later in the scene, Kim calls the actions of the paparazzi “bullying,” she is referring to their physical presence in her life, but it applies equally to their purpose: making it as difficult as possible for her to appear in public in a way that won’t be construed as a pregnant body out of control. Most of the paparazzi policing was published in “unsanctioned” gossip outlets — the tabloids and gossip blogs that don’t rely on cooperation from the celebrities they cover. But there was an opportunity for a counternarrative, and Us Weekly took it, publishing photos of Kardashian on vacation in Greece with her family, with the caption “You Call This Fat?” next to her clearly pregnant stomach. Kim looks relaxed and unpretentious, her hair in a loose braid; her makeup replaced by a bronzed glow. Instead of “stuffing” herself into inappropriate maternity wear, she’s wearing a bikini that frees her body. It was easy to frame the photos as an embrace, on Kim’s part, of her pregnant form: “She’s loving the seventh month,” a source told Us. “And she thinks pregnancy is so cute.” It wasn’t until months after the issue hit newsstands and the footage of the family in Greece aired on E! that the discordance of that claim became clear. In her seventh month, Kardashian found pregnancy distinctly miserable. “I feel like I’ve turned into a different person,” she said, just before putting on the bikini captured on the cover of Us. “I just feel like a huge roly-​­poly . . . It’s like an alien inside of you.” In the next episode, the rest of the family discusses Kim’s inability to enjoy herself at the breakfast table: “She’s so not happy,” Kris says. “I mean pregnancy isn’t for everyone,” Khloé responds. “It doesn’t seem like she’s enjoying hers.” Kim’s family at once bemoans her inability to enjoy the pregnancy and reinforces the very anxieties that’ve made it difficult: the obscenity of her body, and her fear of it. When Kim comes down to breakfast, for example, she’s the most disheveled she’s been all season — no makeup, her hair tied up in a truly messy, not performatively messy, bun. “I just don’t care right now,” she says. Kris starts commenting on the size of her breasts: “I don’t know how she goes day to day with those boobs,” she says, to no one in particular. “Shit, you’ve got some big fucking boobs. I’ve never seen anything like them; it’s two watermelons.” “There’s not even milk in them yet,” Kim replies. “Which is the scary part.” The three episodes in Greece offer a portrait of a pregnant body so thoroughly surveilled that it begins to discipline itself: while her siblings are goofing around and jumping off the yacht, Kim stays out of sight, typing on her phone and lying in bed. She wears long dresses in the hot sun; she acts as family photographer. She tries not to scratch her stretch marks, for fear that the scratching will make them permanent. She holds up her feet at dinner and pushes into the flesh to demonstrate just how swollen they’ve become. She says, “I’ve been really scrutinized my whole pregnancy, about what I wear, my weight, which is ridiculous, and it’s so frustrating that the paparazzi are here,” and “I just want to fulfill a craving without a picture of me stuffing my face.” In other words, Kardashian wants to defy the expectations of pregnant beauty, but she’s been so steeped in its rhetoric that she can’t help but feel shame, and anger, at her inability to do so. Kim’s family urges her to engage further in the public spectacle of her pregnancy — even when, as Kim admits, “to say that all the scrutiny doesn’t get to me, I would be lying.” When they return stateside, Kim tells her sisters she doesn’t even want a baby shower, because of all the “negative attention” she’s already garnered. But Khloé and Kourtney keep planning one behind her back, and Kris insists Kim watch footage from when she was pregnant with Rob to see just how meaningful a shower was to her. Kim’s family ultimately wins the argument, in part because a baby shower — and the inclusion of one’s friends and family in the anticipation of a child — is now compulsory: to refuse a baby shower is much more unruly than to have a lavish one filmed by a host of cameras.",0
1453328370809274370,who wants to eat my butthole  Kim is a fat lady,"And while Kim eventually comes around to the idea of the shower — and the shower itself comes off as loving, inclusive, and emotional — it only solidifies her anxiety over how the rest of her pregnancy will be documented. “I just want to make sure I’m doing it all right,” she says while discussing her birth plan. “I just wanna be perfect.” That perfection includes being in “full glam” for the birth — her face made up, her hair done, her nails done in a shade that will look good, as Kim explains, when her daughter Instagrams the photo in twenty years. She also starts planning what she’ll do the instant she reinhabits her old body: “The first thing I want to do is some nude shoot,” she tells her sisters. “I just want to walk down the street fully naked,” but only “when I’m skinny again.” Everyone thinks Kim’s being ridiculous, but her behavior is simply the next level of the ideology that’s been policing her all along: if her body can’t “be perfect,” she wants everything else — the look on her face when she gives birth, the composition of the Instagram her daughter will someday post, the body that she’ll return to — to be as close to ideal as possible. With an official diagnosis of preeclampsia, Kardashian ended up giving birth nearly six weeks early. After the delivery, she suffered from a condition called placenta accreta, which meant the doctor had to reach his hand inside her and physically scrape the placenta from the uterus. Her delivery, like the rest of her pregnancy, was not “perfect.” But that’s only if you believe there’s such a thing as perfect: ultimately, both Kardashian and her baby, North Kardashian West, survived the labor in good health. North was treated overnight for jaundice, but everything was just fine. The takeaway from Kardashian’s very public pregnancy, however, was that “just fine” just isn’t enough when it comes to the contemporary pregnant body. Even if the concept of “perfect” is wobbly and contradictory, it remains the pregnant woman’s goal. A perfect pregnancy style, a perfect weight gain, a perfect attitude toward pregnancy. When a woman is unable to achieve that perfection, or refuses its pursuit altogether, she’s shamed: if not by her immediate circle of friends and family, whose shaming is often cloaked in the language of “advice,” then by the representations of “ideal pregnancy” that, over the course of the last thirty years, have become regular fixtures of our media diet. Kardashian’s unruly pregnancy punctured that ideology. By speaking about her discomfort, by airing its minutiae on television, even by continuing to wear clothing that compelled the press to shame her, again and again, it sent a message: if one of the most beautiful and valuable women in the world can’t have a perfect pregnancy, then maybe we can rethink what “perfect,” and its connotations of docility, femininity, containment, and good taste, might mean. Granted, Kardashian was rebelling not by choice, but out of necessity: her body forced her to. If she had the choice, she would’ve loved to reinforce the norm — a posture borne out by her second pregnancy, in which she was more circumspect in how she dressed and dealt with far less press scrutiny, in large part because her body wasn’t dealing with preeclampsia and, as such, didn’t provide the same spectacle.",0
1453328370809274370,who wants to eat my butthole  Kim is a fat lady,"Kardashian may have felt bullied, saddened, and otherwise hurt by the reception of her pregnancy; she was certainly disappointed in her own failure to live up to the ideal. But when things didn’t go as planned, she planned differently: watching the season, you get the sense of a woman figuring out how to navigate, on her own terms, a world that’s told her not only that she’s “too pregnant,” but that she’s also been too fat, too superficial, too",0
1453328370809274370,who wants to eat my butthole  Kim is a fat lady,"fake, too curvy, too sexual. The anxiety over Kardashian’s body is, of course, actually over her power: that a woman whose primary skill is the way she lives life could so effectively market that life. That even if she’s married to the best rapper in the world, she’s still the most influential person in the room. It’s easy to mistake Kardashian for a falsely empowered woman, so thoroughly enmeshed in the ideology of self-​­surveillance and the performance of docility and submission it implies. Yet she has spent the last decade of her life, and her first pregnancy in particular, being labeled as too much of something. She may not own the label of feminist, averring that she’s not a “free the nipple” type girl — but that doesn’t mean that her work to make the labor of femininity visible or reduce the stigma around the “non-​­beautiful” pregnancy isn’t, at heart, a feminist project. It will take years for the cultural influence of Kardashian’s particular brand of unruliness to become clear. But just as Demi Moore’s appearance on the cover of Vanity Fair has become a pivot in attitudes toward pregnancy in public, Kim’s pregnant body, likened to a whale, excised from Vogue, pursued specifically at its worst angles, might mark another era: in which the Supreme Court declared unconstitutional those same anti-​­choice laws that Wendy Davis filibustered against, in which the most famous woman on the planet declares that every body, every pregnancy is different — and in which the business of being a woman in public, even with an audience of millions, still remains that woman’s business alone. ● From TOO FAT, TOO SLUTTY, TOO LOUD: The Rise and Reign of the Unruly Woman by Anne Helen Petersen, on sale June 20th, from PLUME, an imprint of Penguin Random House LLC.

However, because in international relationships there is no avoiding reality, the problems are now suddenly the fault of the EU. What a breathtaking, if predictable, 180-degree turn. As if Brexit had never taken place, the EU as scapegoat is suddenly resurrected and made responsible for the deadlock. What is even more surreal is the implied assertion that the deal the British government had signed and sealed itself had never been negotiated or agreed in that form. The list of the Johnson government’s distortions, half-truths and outright lies is endless. Truth is a currency that is being devalued almost on a daily basis and for that reason, very few Brits make the effort to keep up with it all.",0

He is one of those many homeless Tories who have no place in Johnson’s new right-wing nationalist party.

There is a reason for this. Truth and liberal democracy are intertwined.” If a nation wishes to call its government to account, it needs access to objective truth, to verifiable facts. When that access is destroyed by an unassailable executive, there is the danger of an authoritarian government in the guise of democracy. Poland and Hungary have shown the way. Oborne believes that the UK government has already crossed that line, and he is not alone in thinking this.

The Home Secretary Priti Patel had previously branded all lawyers preventing illegal deportations sanctioned by her department as “lefty human rights activists”. Johnson backed her on the issue. What is even more important is that a few months earlier, he announced the establishment of a commission tasked with redefining the Supreme Court’s remit and the limits of judicial review of the executive’s actions in general. This was a barely concealed act of revenge for the Supreme Court’s ruling against Johnson’s hasty, illegal proroguing of parliament in the autumn of 2019 – if you will, his first transgression on the path towards an authoritarian style of government, but one which the Supreme Court was able to reverse.",0

Its chairman, former Conservative justice minister Edward Faulks, concluded that the courts had by no means exceeded their powers, and had not intervened more frequently in political issues than in the past. He therefore proposed only minimal changes to the prevailing legal situation – clearly a disappointing result for the government. And so Justice Secretary Robert Buckland then cast a very different light on the report. Its findings made it clear, he told the House of Commons, that judges were increasingly willing to expand their remit in the direction of politics, and that this was worrying. Whereupon a surprised Faulks replied a little later on the BBC that Buckland’s conclusion was in no way consistent with his report.",0

And so the Ministry of Justice is currently preparing another way to escape interference by the legislature. In future, laws are to contain “ouster clauses”, which simply place them outside of the legal system. Buckland justified this in an ITV interview: “I don’t want to see our judges, particularly those of the Supreme Court, being drawn in to a political arena, in a way frankly they wouldn’t want to be and [which] would be bad for the balance of the constitution.” In this year’s Queen’s Speech presented at Westminster in May, this went as follows: “The government intends to restore the balance of power between the executive, legislative and judicial branches.”",0

But British democracy is poorly equipped against attacks of this kind. Unlike in the US, where the Trump era has (for the time being) ended, there is no formal system of checks and balances in the UK, no coherently written, codified constitution that can be applied in times of crisis. Instead, the British constitution is a fragile fabric of conventions, age-old rules and precedents, with no clear framework to determine what applies when, and by whom it is decided. So far, it has worked according to the “good chaps principle”, that is, the assumption that politicians with moral integrity would interpret the essence of this muddle correctly. The British are ultimately dependent on the goodwill of the government they have elected. A prime minister who deliberately chooses not to adhere to the rules and spirit of this unwritten constitution, or who even seeks to actively undermine its principles, is an unforeseen circumstance with no effective remedy.",0

The answer to that question is complicated, but the British media have played a significant role, having increasingly failed in their duty to hold the government to account. Even before the Brexit referendum, by far the greater part of the British press exercised little or no corrective function. Since the 1990s, the key aim of media entrepreneur Rupert Murdoch in particular had been to ensure Britain’s isolation and alienation from the EU. Tabloids such as the Sun and the Express, but also quality newspapers such as the Times and the Telegraph, openly supported Johnson from the start, despite knowing him to be a liar: after all, the Times had fired him in the late 1980s over a fabricated quote. But that didn’t bother the owners and publishers of the great British print empires: Murdoch, the Barclay brothers, and men such as Paul Dacre. On the contrary, that is precisely why they recognised Johnson as the perfect vehicle for an ideological project that could hardly have been won with real, truthful arguments.

But that was soon to change.

The chief secretary to the Treasury, Rishi Sunak, said that the compulsory nature of the BBC licence fee should be re-examined. Johnson himself had already asked during the election campaign whether the BBC should be privatised, and now the culture minister Nicky Morgan followed suit. This marked the beginning of a campaign against the broadcaster, which was soon more strident than many previous campaigns. And so the public threats were followed very quickly by concrete action. In the summer of 2020 Downing Street leaked its intention to appoint Charles Moore as the new chairman of the BBC – a Tory who had regularly professed to be the chief opponent of the public service system and had even been convicted for refusing to pay the licence fee.",0

Instead, however, the post went to Richard Sharp, a board member of the right-wing think tank the Centre for Policy Studies, and also a close confidant of the government. Coincidentally, he had donated the equivalent of almost half a million euros to the Tories in recent years. This is clearly at odds with being an independent chair. And that is the real problem for the BBC in this day and age. When, after the war, the British set in place a federal-based public service broadcasting system for the Germans, they ensured that centralised access to a national broadcasting system by politicians would no longer be possible. Back home, however, they did not view such considerations to be necessary at the time.

When, in 2016, three High Court judges ruled that Brexit could not simply be implemented on the basis of the “the will of the people” without parliamentary involvement, the front page of the Mail featured photos of the three judges and the headline “Enemies of the people”. This could scarcely have gone to print without Dacre’s approval. He has hardly been more lenient with the BBC. For years the corporation has been his newspaper’s number one enemy: in a vociferous and unrelenting war of aggression, he lobbed absurd accusations at the broadcaster, such as suggesting it peddles a kind of “cultural Marxism”. Johnson now wants to put this man in charge of the media regulator Ofcom, despite considerable opposition. In fact, there is a selection committee for this position. After the committee arrived at the unanimous decision that Dacre was not a suitable candidate for the post, something happened that is typical of the Johnson administration: instead of looking for a new, more suitable candidate, the commission was simply dissolved. In the summer, after being re-constituted, the committee is to start work all over again. This represents a wholly unusual direct intervention by the government in standard procedures.

And it is perfectly possible that threatening figures such as Dacre are brought into play mainly for the expected chilling effect they have on the corporation. In any event, the government’s relentless threats have already struck home. The BBC has grown noticeably more cautious and fearful when reporting on the Johnson administration. For example when, at the beginning of a broadcast in May 2020, the well-known presenter of Newsnight, Emily Maitlis, criticised Johnson’s then-chief adviser Dominic Cummings, who was caught breaking the lockdown rules he had introduced, she was admonished. The next morning, BBC management apologised in a public statement for Maitlis’s comments. Not that anybody had spoken to her or the editorial board.",0

When the BBC admitted that one of its reporters had gained access to interview Princess Diana under false pretences 25 years ago – an admittedly disturbing act, albeit one that goes back almost a generation – ministers were allowed to attack the BBC’s current management for days on end, on BBC programmes, threatening the broadcaster with far-reaching consequences. The BBC TV presenters, in what often amounted to downright masochistic subservience, practically seemed to be urging such action to be taken. The numerous failures, mistakes and lies of the Johnson administration, however, are addressed much more sparingly or not at all. What is particularly striking is the virtually non-existent reporting on the increasing cases of corruption within British ministries. When Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair’s former press spokesman, pointed this out recently on the BBC News channel, the presenter Martine Croxall replied: “But do people care?!” That suggests an acceptance on her part of the government’s own spin and a blatant misunderstanding of her role. Indeed, should it be the case that people don’t care, the first task of the BBC should be to make sure that they do care, a lot.

Wherever control of the government by the judiciary and independent media is no longer guaranteed, the risk of systemic corruption grows. This now seems to be happening in the UK. At the beginning of the pandemic, almost unnoticed by the public, the government passed the Coronavirus Act, which allows it to introduce regulations without parliamentary scrutiny. It used these powers to establish new public structures in the health system under the direct control of the ministries, the largest of these being the Test and Trace system, which to date has devoured the unimaginable sum of £37bn.

He was the leading spin doctor of the Brexit campaign, who was largely responsible for Leave’s win, using aggressive and dubious methods. After he stepped down from his post as Johnson’s chief aide amid controversy, he gave evidence to a joint inquiry into the handling of the pandemic, where he described in detail all the lies, the brazen behaviour and cynicism of the Johnson administration. But not even the opposition really had the strength to call on the ministers concerned to resign. A few years ago it would at least have gone through the motions.

Why did nothing of what Cummings put forward resonate in the public arena? The answer is relatively simple: because Cummings fell victim to his own strategy. It was he who, together with Johnson, first ushered in the post-truth era in Great Britain, thereby destroying the very basis on which a minister, or even Johnson, can still be held accountable. To be able to do that, you need truth as your currency, the distinction between right and wrong, as a valid criterion in the democratic dialogue.

That is because from the outset, Brexit was for Johnson solely a route to power. He probably secretly hoped that the expulsion of his anarchic chief adviser meant he could now leave the dirty part of the business behind him and simply rule as normal from now on. That, however, is not going to happen, much as Johnson himself may have longed for it. First, because Johnson is not a normal politician himself: his entire life to date has consisted of breaking rules and crossing legal and ethical boundaries. He made it to Downing Street thanks to the Brexit campaign and the destructive power inherent in the project. As the Cummings hearing showed, the consequent blurring of empirical reality can’t be undone in the foreseeable future.

He became famous in the late 1990s and early 2000s for his appearances on a popular satirical news program, Have I Got News for You. Each time, he was the butt of the jokes and also the center of attention. After he was first elected to Parliament, in 2001, his colleagues told him that he would have to become serious to succeed in politics.

This is where Johnson’s legacy is most at risk. If he were to preside over the breakup of the country, whatever else he did would forever be overshadowed.

Its driving force was John Bew, Johnson’s chief foreign-policy adviser and the author of Realpolitik, a book published four years before Johnson came to power that now reads like a primer for Johnsonism. According to Bew, realpolitik is based on four interlocking principles: politics is the law of the strong; states are strong when they are domestically harmonious; ideas matter because people believe them, not because they are true; and finally, the zeitgeist is “the single most important factor in determining the trajectory of a nation’s politics.”",0

In The Globalization Paradox, the Harvard economist Dani Rodrik notes that the more tightly the world’s economies intertwine, the less influence national governments can have over the lives of their citizens. For a long time, governments—including Britain’s—believed that the economic benefits of globalization outweighed that cost. But when this bargain began to reveal its emptiness, particularly after 2008, voters demanded more control. In Britain this was particularly acute, because the country was more exposed than most, with its oversize financial sector and open economy. It was ripe for a revolt to “take back control”—the “Leave” campaign’s central promise.",0

By the 1580s, Puritans were producing pamphlets [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marprelate_Controversy#:~:text=The%20Marprelate%20Controversy%20was%20a,which%20remained%20an%20established%20church ] (the so-called Martin Marprelate  [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Marprelate ]tracts) characterising the “Popish” English Church as venal and corrupt. Their pamphlets were not subtle, with the clergy mocked in an irreverent and comic manner. It was a kind of fake news of its day: light on facts, heavy on ad hominem. It caused an outrage: laughing at bishops just wasn’t cricket. Anti-Puritans caught on that it was pointless responding to the Martinists in any reasoned, coherent manner. It just sounded pompous. So the anti-Puritans came up with a new strategy: they joined in the obscene fun, levelling equally cruel (and amusing) insults at the Martinists in their own series pamphlets. Well, if you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em. These anti-Puritan caricatures eventually made their way onto the stage. Falstaff is based on John Oldcastle [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Oldcastle ], who, as a Lollard [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lollardy ], was very unlikely to have shared Plump Jack’s predilection for thievery, comely wenches and sack [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sack_(wine) ].",0

Decrying the “Popish” EU with a plethora of outlandish claims isn’t what you’d expect from a professional journalist - but it’s exactly what you’d expect from a Martinist. The point of Boris’s submissions was to throw enough mud over the years to make the EU look ridiculous. No facts required. And it worked.

As a construct, Falstaff bridges a post-Reformation era polarised between Puritans and anti-Puritans. Call it an Elizabethan culture war. Falstaff (like Johnson’s monster, Boris) doesn’t work if you make him king. Becoming prime minister was never a very good idea. Johnson, somewhat predictably, has presided over a shell government; he’s busy looking busy and the Conservative party is looking increasingly hollowed out.

He has achieved his lifetime's ambition of getting into Ten Downing Street and now means to make sure that he leaves more than just a footnote in the history books. The size of the imprint he leaves on History may be more important than any qualitative evaluation. Well, here I am! Have fun, make a splash!

He has cheated on all his wives and lovers. 
He has multiple children, such that he has no idea how many: who they are, where they are, are they well and healthy - as most responsible parents would want to know.
He was a proud member of the Bullingdon Club at Oxford, the whole purpose of which was to be served VERY expensive food and wine, then have a food fight with it all and trash the premises, then pay in wads of cash to show just how wealthy the members of the club were, and how little they cared.
He is subject of many dubious scandals, dodgy deals etc.
He shows no respect or empathy for other people.
When a journalist criticized him, BOZO gave out details, conspiring to get the journalist beaten up.",0

If it were united with Argentina by the will of its people, being that we are two independent countries, it should be contemplated if it joins as another province or under what consideration, there would be two presidents but there can only be one, we should see if this affects territorial treaties with neighboring countries, take into consideration the external debts of both countries and the commitments made, trade agreements with other countries, we would have two constitutions to reconcile and a long etcetera. If the union of two people is complicated, so much will be the union of two countries. If it were by force, we would destabilize the entire region, not only because of the war that would be unleashed, but because Paraguay or Chile would ask if they could be the next.

The Exocet would be lured by electronic counter measures towards the Sea King or even by the large radar signature of this big helicopter. An Exocet is an active homing missile, detecting its target with it onboard radar. It also has a laser- controlled height control which is designed to keep it only 6 feet from the sea so that it should impact at the waterline. Hence if you keep your helicopter appreciably more than 6 feet in the air, the chances of being hit are minimal at worst. Additionally, if your ship is hit and sunk, a Sea King is the safest place to be (provided you can land it somewhere). There is always the risk of mechanical malfunction of course especially in the extreme conditions of the South Atlantic.

For Jews, the Messiah will come to deliver redemption in some eschatological (end of time) event but not necessarily in terms of exclusive salvation for Jews for those outside the faith need to observe seven simple Noachide Laws to stay on the straight and narrow. Ultimately, these differences led to irreconcilable schism and two thousand years of embittered relations.",0

Pluralism was not tolerated. Hence, the Middle Ages saw burnings of Christian heretics, a simple way to purge wrongful beliefs. Jews were already portrayed as beyond the pale or worse: some Christian theologians saw them as blind to the ""coming of the messiah"", whilst others quite literally demonized them. Medieval European cathedrals today still have statues of the fallen and blindfolded Synagoga standing beside a triumphant Ecclesia. St Augustine believed that Jews had been left to wander the earth as a ""damned people"" and later Christian rulers promoted anti-Judaic measures such as ghettoes, the wearing of special clothing and the banning of Jews from trades and from time-to-time Jews were butchered.",0

[2] Words she wrote in the New York Times. [3] Now I think the truth is somewhat in the middle: Even though racism plays a destructive part in British society, as in so many other countries, European or not, I think that, although racism follows you, it is not the only factor and one’s behaviour can make a change. I must admit, that in the case of Meghan Markle, racism played a big part in the way the tabloids commented on her. I was and am very annoyed by that and as you know or don’t know, I wrote two articles and a letter to the Council of Brighton to defend her. [4] Who knows me realizes that I can’t stand injustice and feel myself obliged to fight it. And racism is one of the ugliest forms of injustice! Now you all know, that recently, Prince Harry and his wife Meghan Markle stepped back as senior royals [5] and that the Queen, Prince Harry’s grandmother, supported them in this [6], but declared: ”Although we would have preferred them to remain full-time working Members of the Royal Family, we respect and understand their wish to live a more independent life as a family while remaining a valued part of my family.’ [7] Of course she preferred them to stay. As a grandmother and greatgrandmother, wishing to spend time with her eighth greatgrandchild, as a royal matriarch and as a Queen, keeping the roles of the Family intact! Recently I wrote a defense article, prasing the supportive statement of the Queen and analysing what, according to my views, among else [there may be other reasons I don’t know about] have led to Megxit, the fact that Harry and Meghan wanted to step out,their roles as fulltime royals in England. And I stated, and the more I read the more I am convinced, that an important reason was the smearcampaign against Meghan Markle, shich had dirty, racist undertones and sometimes more than just undertones. Like the hateful Tweet of Donald Baker, no fired BBC reporter, who compared Prince Harry’s and Meghan Markle newborn son with a chimpanzee! [8] Not only highly racist [people, who deny that this person is a racist or at least racist led in his comments, are close to suffer the same racist ”decease”’ [9] also mean and ugly, when you realize that new parents, who just were blessed with their first son, were confronted with this despicable stuff! From the beginning of the relation between Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, a couple of tabloids and some other parts of the press launched a hateful smear campaign against Meghan Markle with racist undertones, as confirmed in a statement of Prince Harry, in november 2016, nearly two years before their marriage I quote from the statement: ”But the past week has seen a line crossed. His girlfriend, Meghan Markle, has been subject to a wave of abuse and harassment. Some of this has been very public – the smear on the front page of a national newspaper; the racial undertones of comment pieces; and the outright sexism and racism of social media trolls and web article comments” [10] And although the racist thing is denied, for example by Prince Harry and Meghan Markle villifier, the broadcaster, journalist and TV personality, Piers Morgan [11], who stated, that their racism accusations are ”completely and grotesquely wrong” [12] I will show you in underlying, that there ARE racist undertones in the Meghan Markle smearcampaign broadcasting, as well openly, as more hidden. But not only the press and tabloids! Newspaper The Sun wrote in march 2019, that Meghan Markle was bombed with 5200 hateful racist and sexist tweets in two months, and 70 percent abuse came from twenty trolls! [13] And also her sister in law, Kate Middleton, the wife of the Duke of Cambridge [Prince William, Harry’s elder brother and heir to the throne after his father, Prince Charles], was subjected to hateful, sexist tweets! [14] READ ON ABOUT THE ROLE OF THE PRESS/TABLOIDS AND BE INDIGNANT WITH ME! A tabloid columnist wrote about Meghan Markle’s ”exotic DNA”, which refers to her Afro American descent [from her mother’s side, her father is a white American, Thomas Markle, a former TV lighting director and director of photography] [15] and therefore racist undertoned. Another dubious remark was made in a Daily Mail headline article, describing Meghan’s Los Angeles roots as “(almost) straight outta Compton” and claimed she came from a “gang-scarred” neighborhood. [16] As you probably know, ”Straight outta Compton” as a picture about the rise and fall of the gangster rap group, N.W.A. from rapper and businessman Dr Dre and others Those connection between being of Afro American descent and gangster life or ”gang-scarred neighborhood” is despicable and suggests THAT there is an automatic relation between being black and born in a hood [ghetto] Newspapers should know better! What was the limit, was the comparing of Prince Harry’s and Meghan Markle’s newborn son Archie, with a chimpzanzee by a now fired [because of this affair] BBC reporter, Danny Baker. [18] If that’s not a racist remark, then I don’t know what is! Yet idiots like Piers Morgan declare, that Danny Baker ”is not remotely racist as anyone who knows him” [19] I think that tells more about Piers Morgan than about Danny Baker……. And now, a few minutes ago, I learnt, that Meghan has been bombarded with hundreds of racist and sexist tweets because of her and Harry’s stepping back as royals! [20] And not for the first time: As is written above, the newspaper the Sun wrote in march 2019 about thousands of racist and sexist tweets against Meghan, 70 percent coming from twenty trolls [see the notes 13 and 14] How many idiots are there in this world? Recently, after Megxit was announced [Harry and Meghan’s step out as senior royals], a Hannity radio producer called Meghan ”uppity’ [21] MCLAUGHLIN: Yeah, she’s very uppity. She’s — she’s one of those liberal elitists, you know? [22] Now according to Cambridge dictionnary ”uppity” is a sort of ”neutral” term [I mean, nothing to do with race or descent] An uppity An uppity person behaves in an unpleasant way because they think that they are more important than they really are” [23]",0

That says a lot and although not provable, seen in the whole light of the anti Meghan smear campaign, those not openly racist related comments must have a racist undertone, since Meghan Markle is practically singled out in the tsunami of negativity and other royals are more or less off the hook. AND since the facts the socalled critique is that childish, that even children of primary school would find it below their dignity. There isfor example journalist and TV personality Piers Morgan, who seems obssessed by Meghan Markle, and also, in a lesser extent, by Prince Harry. [27] So it was no surprise that he ranted and raved at the news that Harry and Meghan wanted to step out as senior royals and the supportive reaction of the Queen. [28] AND THEN THE SUPER CHILDISH STUFF Now some examples of being on Meghan’s ”tail” [29], which make no sense. There are a lot more, I presume, yet underlying things give an idea of the nonsense written about Meghan: the fact is that rampant avocado production in the Third World has been linked with water shortages, human rights abuses, illegal deforestation, ecosystem destruction and general environmental devastation.” [30] Firstly, the one, who wrote that nonsense article, admitted, that avocado’s are well loved by all millennials [31], so why single Meghan Markle out! Secondly, I can understand, that people protest when avocado’s are produced in occupation countries as Israel, openly violating elementary human rights [32], but then there is a choice not to eat them, when descending from those countries, like I do. But not to eat all avocado’s is just nonsense. The problems the writer of this article mentioned ”water shortages, human rights abuses, illegal deforestation, ecosystem destruction and general environmental devastation” [33], refers to more Third World products and has everything to do with unfair relations in the world, caused for a great part [apart from natural and climatical causes] by Western economic dominance of the Third World, supported by their local elites. Does the writer of this article protests against those injustices? No, he only uses it to attack Meghan Markle, simply eating an avocado! What about all the other royals, eating avocado’s? What about all milennials, eating avodaco’s? No, this is only a childish attack on Meghan Markle!

THERE MUST BE A DIFFERENCE/QUOD LICET JOVI, NON LICET BOVI! [33] The following all too childish thing, Meghan Markle was critized for, of course [among else], again by stalking newspaper Daily Mail, was the fact, that Meghan, mother to be, had had the audacity to ”keep her hands on her bump”, a normal and affectionate thing any pregnant mother does. This nonsense article was titled ”Why can’t Meghan Markle keep her hands off her bump? Experts tackle the question that has got the nation talking: Is it pride, vanity, acting – or a new age bonding technique?” [34] No you, readers, will probably say” What is it to the Daily Mail, whether Meghan Markle keeps her hands on What’s the newsvalue in it, even for tabloids? It is a private gesture of a happy mother to be, done by milliards of mothers before and after us! It’s about stalking and harassing Meghan Markle again! But now the cat is out of the bag! [35] The Daily Mail anti Meghan article about ”keep her hands on her bump” was written on 26 january 2019 [36] But when Meghan’s sister in law, Kate Middleton, acted on a similar way, that same Daily Mail wrote on 21 march 2018 ” NOT LONG TO GO!

She was merely escaping her crumbling marriage into the arms of someone who seemed to better understand her. Charles didn't enjoy the same privilege in the public eye.

Camilla has a chance Anne Boleyn never had - to slowly win the public over and grow into her role as consort. Whether she will ever be the Queen of Great Britain remains to be seen, but it seems public perception of her is softening as time passes. Anne had only a scant three years. Her reign is mostly known from the “tabloids [ http://under-these-restless-skies.blogspot.com/2014/03/eustace-chapuys.html ]” of her day, and so we may never have a clear picture of what she was really like, and what she could have become had she survived Henry’s obsession.",0

But if I’m honest, I think his prime concern was that of his reputation. It was Charles, not Her Majesty, who insisted on stripping Diana of her HRH status, and the Royal protection that went with it. The Queen was said to be happy for her to keep it, bearing in mind that she was the mother of a future King. Charles insisted on its removal as part of their divorce deal.",0

Although not quite a man, he was old enough to process the grief and anger he had to be feeling. Also, I think, he has his mother’s strength and ability to process the moment and carry on smartly.

1453291893618581512,So this is why Meghan Markle is the literal devil and will make the UK surrender the Falklands,"Harry, on the other hand, was 12. Puberty and adolescence is difficult enough to maneuver with BOTH of your parents nearby. Imagine having to face entering your teen years without your mum—especially when she promised to be home for your 13th birthday. Look at the pictures of William and Harry greeting the people outside of the palace. William had the ability to fake it, but poor Harry was shell-shocked. Then add in that his grandparents’ attitude was “Diana made her bed, now she can lie in it. That said, it’s over and done, so chin up and move on”—even going so far as to take the boys HUNTING the day after Diana’s death! Tell me how that couldn’t have lasting effects on Harry.",0

I doubt that there was much done in the way of counseling and therapy to deal with grief and PTSD. William had both parents to see him off at Eton; Harry had his dad and the press. As William made his way out of his teens and went on sabbaticals and Peace Corps missions, Harry was pretty much by himself still trying to figure out the teen years.",0

1453291893618581512,So this is why Meghan Markle is the literal devil and will make the UK surrender the Falklands,"I think joining the military and becoming a highly decorated pilot and platoon leader helped Harry’s self-esteem. I think as he’s gotten older and decided to get therapy, he has settled that wild child. Helping to create the “Invictus Games” (based on America’s Wounded Warrior Games) was an altruistic step in the right direction. Becoming an uncle to his brother’s children help to give him purpose.

Prince William conducts himself with grace and gentlemanly demeanour and it is unlikely that he would bear his soul in public about his feeling regarding Harry.",0

In effect, as heir to the throne, he was trying to act as big brother and give Harry some heartfelt and significant advice.

Harry admitted himself in an interview to his friend Tom Bradby when the Sussexes had returned from their trip to South Africa that both he and William were now on ‘different paths’. Apparently this interview caused more frustrations to William and the Royal Family in general because up to now it was a rule to keep shtum in such private royal matters.

GOP critics say Strzok’s texts with former FBI lawyer Lisa Page — with whom he was having an extramarital affair at the time — are clear evidence of anti-Trump bias. They argue Strzok's disdain toward Trump may have influenced two high-profile FBI probes, given Strzok’s central role in both the investigation into 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while secretary of State and the beginnings of special counsel Robert Mueller's probe into Russian election interference. Democrats, as well as Strzok’s lawyer, have claimed that the attacks on Strzok are an attempt to undermine Mueller's probe, which is examining ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. “It is a decision that produces only one winner — those who seek to harm our country and weaken our democracy,” Goelman said in his statement. Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz released a report earlier this year that fiercely criticized Strzok for his conduct, saying he displayed a “biased state of mind” during a key phase of the Clinton email probe. One of the most explosive revelations from Horowitz's report was a text Strzok sent to Page in which he said they will ""stop"" Trump from becoming president. Horowitz, however, said his investigative team found no evidence that any decision made during the course of the investigation was a result of political bias or improper influence. Nonetheless, the report found that those actions cast a cloud over the department and was deeply critical of FBI and Justice Department leadership. Mueller promptly removed Strzok from his team after Horowitz's internal review uncovered the critical text messages that disparaged Trump and his supporters. Goelman emphasized that there is no evidence to support that Strzok’s personal views ever affected his work, noting that these fall under his First Amendment rights. “A lengthy investigation and multiple rounds of Congressional testimony failed to produce a shred of evidence that Special Agent Strzok’s personal views ever affected his work,” Goelman said. “In fact, in his decades of service, Special Agent Strzok has proved himself to be one of the country’s top counterintelligence officers, leading to only one conclusion — the decision to terminate was taken in response to political pressure, and to punish Special Agent Strzok for political speech protected by the First Amendment, not on a fair and independent examination of the facts.”",0

1453248028211617804,"Hillary Clinton is a fkn snake, one of the most evil people to ever walk the planet. You must be incredibly naive.","Here is a story I read that can be confirmed. Following 911 the president was confronted with a national crisis. How he handled things was going to have a significant impact on our nation at the time and into the future. It was the first crisis of this kind he had ever faced and that any president would have faced. President Bush was giving one of the most important addresses to the country and all the dignitaries and self important people were there. It was a big deal. These big events are governed by protocol when it comes to positioning and sitting people. Well protocol dictates that the order of Presidents is the the last president is higher on protocol list than the second to last. So according to protocol President Clinton was to be sitting next to George W as he was the sitting president. Then next to the Clintons was George H.W. Bush. The Clintons knew the the President was receiving a lot of support from his parents. The Clintons insisted on breaking with protocol so that George and Barbara Bush could sit with their son to provide support during what was the most significant event their son would ever be confronted with. A small gesture that reveals a lot about the Clinton’s awareness and priorities. George W. related that event and also the respect the Clintons showed President H.W. Bush after defeating him in the 1992 election led to the appointment of President Clinton and H.W. to head up the Haiti relief efforts. The Clintons are reportedly now very close to the Bushes, and Bill (according to W.) spends more time with his parents in Maine than anyone else in the family.",0

So Mr. Thomas signaled, literally before the dust had settled, that he was determined to use terrorism as an excuse to pursue a radical right-wing agenda.

Brooks was released from jail last Friday after he made bail in a case where he allegedly ran over a woman with his car. The judge in that case set Brooks’s bail at $1,000, a shockingly low amount for someone with a criminal record as long as his. The media and federal government are already working to bury the details of Brooks’s latest crime because it doesn’t fit the narrative that “there’s nothing more frightening in America today than an angry white man,” as CNN wrote just hours before the Waukesha massacre.

The Biden administration isn’t at all worried about nominating a Marxist to oversee the U.S. banking system. Since Biden’s entry into the White House, the Communist agenda has come out of the shadows and is now proudly celebrated in nearly every institution in America. [28:10] Pfizer’s Cover-up (3 minutes) The Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) reviewed 329,000 pages of documents in 108 days before approving the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.

Other verses describe what man views as righteous is just “filthy rags” (Isaiah 64:6). Understanding human nature and its real source is one key to learning why this world is in its present state.

Moreover, the idea of taking 800,000 now productive, taxpaying participants out of the economy is fiscally insane, so the economics are likewise good. The real question then is why the GOP isn’t just going along. The answer, I suspect, is that those opposed to DACA (and it is awfully hard to split this issue from the race of those in question), almost all tend to be Republican primary voters. Thus, “fixing” DACA is great in a general election, but lots of Republican office holders worry that they will be knocked out in a primary.

Clinton’s love for policy discussion and need for human contact were not controlled by the structure that a strong chief of staff would have imposed. Meetings ran overtime, decisions were endlessly revised, and the president spent his time on unproductive tasks. Everyone seemed to have access to the Oval Office. While Clinton arguably performed better later in his administration, few think that his first year in office was especially well-spent. (See John P.

He urged Bush to pick a White House chief of staff before Election Day; by October, the nominee had settled on Andrew Card, a veteran of both the Reagan and George H.W. Bush White Houses. Bush wanted Card to serve as an “honest broker” rather than as a “deputy president”; Card had served as John Sununu’s deputy but seemed to see his former boss mostly as a model of how not to behave.

One thing which made the bond we struck in good faith somewhat palatable to me was my high regard for you personally. In retrospect, it seems that the admiration might not have been mutual had you known a little more about me, about my political beliefs and activities. At least you might have thought me more fit for the draft than for ROTC. Let me try to explain. As you know, I worked for two years in a very minor position on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. I did it for the experience and the salary, but also for the opportunity, however small, of working every day against a war I opposed and despised with a depth of feeling I had reserved solely for racism in America before Vietnam. I did not take the matter lightly, but studied it carefully, and there was a time when not many people had more information about Vietnam at hand than I did. I have written and spoken and marched against the war. One of the national organizers of the Vietnam Moratorium is a close friend of mine.

1453188928945668098,Bill Clinton is a hoe he can’t help it #ImpeachmentFX,"Interlocked with the war is the draft issue, which I did not begin to consider separately until early 1968. For a law seminar at Georgetown I wrote a paper on the legal arguments for and against allowing, within the Selective Service System, the classification of selective conscientious objection, for those opposed to participation in a particular war, not simply to, quote, participation in war in any form, end quote. From my work I came to believe that the draft system itself is illegitimate. No government really rooted in limited, parliamentary democracy should have the power to make its citizens fight and kill and die in a war they may oppose, a war which even possibly may be wrong, a war which, in any case, does not involve immediately the peace and freedom of the nation. The draft was justified in World War II because the life of the people collectively was at stake. Individuals had to fight if the nation was to survive, for the lives of their countrymen and their way of life. Vietnam is no such case. Nor was Korea, an example where, in my opinion, certain military action was justified but the draft was not, for the reasons stated above. Because of my opposition to the draft and the war, I am in great sympathy with those who are not willing to fight, kill, and maybe die for their country, that is, the particular policy of a particular government, right or wrong. Two of my friends at Oxford are conscientious objectors. I wrote a letter of recommendation for one of them to his Mississippi draft board, a letter which I am more proud of than anything else I wrote at Oxford last year. One of my roommates is a draft resister who is possibly under indictment and may never be able to go home again. He is one of the bravest, best men I know. His country needs men like him more than they know. That he is considered a criminal is an obscenity. The decision not to be a resister and the related subsequent decisions were the most difficult of my life. I decided to accept the draft in spite of my beliefs for one reason: to maintain my political viability within the system. For years I have worked to prepare myself for a political life characterized by both practical political ability and concern for rapid social progress. It is a life I still feel compelled to try to lead. I do not think our system of government is by definition corrupt, however dangerous and inadequate it has been in recent years (the society may be corrupt, but that is not the same thing, and if that is true we are all finished anyway). When the draft came, despite political convictions, I was having a hard time facing the prospect of fighting a war I had been fighting against, and that is why I contacted you. ROTC was the one way left in which I could possibly, but not positively, avoid both Vietnam and resistance. Going on with my education, even coming back to England, played no part in my decision to join ROTC. I am back here, and would have been at Arkansas Law School, because there is nothing else I can do. In fact, I would like to have been able to take a year out perhaps to teach in a small college or work on some community action project and in the process to decide whether to attend law school or graduate school and how to be putting what I have learned to use. But the particulars of my personal life are not nearly as important to me as the principles involved. After I signed the ROTC letter of intent I began to wonder whether the compromise I had made with myself was not more objectionable than the draft would have been, because I had no interest in the ROTC program in itself and all I seemed to have done was to protect myself from physical harm. Also, I began to think I had deceived you, not by lies - there were none - but by failing to tell you all the things I'm writing now. I doubt that I had the mental coherence to articulate them then. At that time, after we had made our agreement and you had sent my 1 - D deferment to my draft board, the anguish and loss of self-regard and self-confidence really set in. I hardly slept for weeks and kept going by eating compulsively and reading until exhaustion brought sleep. Finally on September 12th, I stayed up all night writing a letter to the chairman of my draft board, saying basically what is in the preceding paragraph, thanking him for trying to help me in a case where he really couldn't, and stating that I couldn't do the ROTC after all and would he please draft me as soon as possible. I never mailed the letter, but I did carry it on me every day until I got on the plane to return to England. I didn't mail the letter because I didn't see, in the end, how my going in the Army and maybe going to Vietnam would achieve anything except a feeling that I had punished myself and gotten what I deserved. So I came back to England to try to make something of this second year of my Rhodes scholarship. And that is where I am now, writing to you because you have been good to me and have a right to know what I think and feel. I am writing too in the hope that my telling this one story will help you to understand more clearly how so many fine people have come to find themselves still loving their country but loathing the military, to which you and other good men have devoted years, lifetimes, of the best service you could give. To many of us, it is no longer clear what is service and what is disservice, or if it is clear, the conclusion is likely to be illegal. Forgive the length of this letter. There was much to say. There is still a lot to be said, but it can wait. Please say hello to Colonel Jones for me. Merry Christmas. I will appear on Nightline tonight to discuss all of this in greater detail. ""All of this"" is the controversy over Bill Clinton's draft record, and this 22 - year - old letter, obtained by Nightline, in which Clinton writes, no government "" ... should have the power to make its citizens fight and kill and die in a war they oppose ... "" It's the letter of a young man who loved his country and had strong beliefs about what was right and wrong at that time. This is ABC News Nightline. Reporting from Washington, Ted Koppel. Before this broadcast is over tonight, I will have read to you the entire text of a 22 - year - old letter which was written by a 23 - year - old Bill Clinton. It is, as Governor Clinton himself described it today, the account of a conflicted and thoughtful young man. It is quite a remarkable letter, actually, eloquent and revealing. Many of you will hear it and find in it a reaffirmation of everything you like and admire about Bill Clinton. Others among you will be angered by what you hear. It is safe to assume that those who leaked the letter to us at Nightline and to our colleagues at World News Tonight did not do so in the expectation, however, that this letter would help the Clinton campaign. As the governor noted earlier in the day, presidential politics is a contact sport. Having said that, it is also clear that the Clinton campaign feels that the leaking of the letter just days before the New Hampshire primary is a low blow. A quick summary now from Nightline correspondent Jeff Greenfield. George Bush and the Republican Party will do anything it takes to win. That's what they did in 1988, and they'll do it again in 1992. Bill Clinton was talking about the leak of a letter he had written more than 22 years ago, filled with a young man's anguish and anger about the war in Vietnam and the draft. But as the governor of Arkansas faced this roomful of reporters today, he might have been asking himself, ""How did I get here?"" For months, Clinton's presidential campaign had been a textbook model. He had been on a roll since last November, when a speech in Chicago had wowed the state party chairs and the political press with its broadly appealing message of public compassion and personal responsibility. Most people are worried about keeping body and soul together, and they're asking, ""Since I played by the rules, I paid the taxes, I did the work, I sent my kids to war, why am I getting the shaft?"" It is those questions that we have to answer if we want to win the election of 1992. He won the money primary, far outstripping his rivals in raising campaign funds. He'd won the media primary, with magazine covers touting his progress, and earlier this year, the polls were showing the 45 - year - old Clinton sprinting to a big lead in New Hampshire, where a big primary win would likely mean an all but inevitable presidential nomination. It became clear well before the first of the year that Clinton had thought through what it meant to be president, had answers to all these significant questions about issues, had the kind of message that would likely make him electable if he won a nomination. Even the widely publicized charges of marital infidelity three weeks ago did not derail his campaign, but when The Wall Street Journal last week charged that Clinton had received a Vietnam draft deferment for an ROTC program he never joined, the ground seemed to shift. Members of the same political class that, two months ago, were saying, ""This guy's the winner,"" are now questioning his electability. Clinton has long acknowledged his opposition to the Vietnam war. As a Rhodes scholar in England, he helped organize an anti - war protest in November of 1969. But he has also said that it was his doubts about the morality of the war and the Selective Service system that led him to abandon the ROTC idea and to subject himself to a draft lottery. Only the luck of the draw - a high lottery number - kept him out. One of his friends from his Oxford days strongly backs Clinton's story. The recollection of people who knew Bill Clinton well, who were with him every day, was that when he arrived back in Oxford in the fall of 1969, he expected that he would be drafted. He was so uncertain about his future and so uncertain about how much of the year he would be able to complete at Oxford that he did not rent a room for himself. He lived with friends instead. But fairly or not, the issue has clearly hurt. Certainly the fact that most people just met Bill Clinton recently makes it more difficult to deal with this. They don't know about his career, they don't know about a lifetime of dealing with interesting issues, they don't know about the kinds of things he's been talking about for a dozen years in government. Now, Clinton has taken to the airwaves, urging New Hampshire voters to send a message about the process. Now there are those who want to divide and distract us from what's really important, but I trust the people of New Hampshire to reject that kind of negative politics. Even before the first primary votes have been cast, Bill Clinton has already been through two acts of any presidential campaign, the ""gee - whiz stage"" and the ""wait - a - minute stage"". The outcome of the third act will almost certainly determine his political fate. I'm Jeff Greenfield for Nightline. And joining us now live from Manchester, New Hampshire is Governor Bill Clinton. Good evening, Governor. As I told you just before we went on the air, we have a late - tracking poll from The Boston Globe and television station WBZ. We're going to take a look at that tracking poll right now. If you'll look at your screen, you will see that a few days ago - can you - do you have a screen there where you can see it? Okay. A few days ago, on the 8th of February, you were still showing 28 percent, and Senator Tsongas was showing 25 percent. As of today, Tsongas is up to 30 percent and you're down to 19 percent. Do you attribute that - do you attribute the impact to The Wall Street Journal story which first raised the draft issue? Well, I think that and then the comments over the weekend, when I was not in New Hampshire. I was home trying to get over the flu, and there were a lot of press reports over the weekend saying, ""Well, this raises questions about his electability and questions about character,"" and I think a lot of people heard from it secondhand. I should have put an ad on right away, as soon as the Journal story broke. The Journal story itself confirmed what I said all along, which is that I gave up my deferment before the lottery came in, I was in the draft. It was the luck of the draw that I got a high lottery number. I did not dodge the draft, I did not do anything wrong, and that has not been contradicted, even by people who have changed their stories over the intervening years. Governor, if I may, I'd like to come back to that after folks have had a chance to hear the entire letter. I have to assume that when you were not out campaigning and pressing the flesh today that you and your advisers had to be sitting around saying, ""How do we turn this thing around again? How do we take a campaign that clearly has been dealt a body blow and put it back on track again?"" Well, I thought, frankly, that we bottomed out a couple of days ago, and sometimes these polls drag a little bit from when you hit rock bottom. Frankly, I've been amazed at the number of my supporters in New Hampshire and the number of people who've stayed with us. I mean, after all, they just met me a few months ago, they don't know much about me. It's not like they've worked through 11 years of hard issues and all the things I've done as governor. They've not seen the real evidence of my political leadership and character, and so I think they've had all this stuff dumped on them here in the last two or three weeks, and finally the dam broke and they're asking themselves questions. The encouraging thing, to me, looking into the eyes of the voters with whom I'm shaking hands and going to these meetings where we're still drawing very, very large crowds, is that I think people are going to take another look. The people in this state are fundamentally fair, they're hurting, they desperately want this election to be about their tomorrows, their future, their problems, not about my yesterdays. They just want to know that I'm all right, that I can do this job, that I can make them a good president, and I hope I can tell them that that's the way it is in the next few days. I feel good about what happened today, I feel good about yesterday, and I'm going to fight like crazy from here on in. All right, Governor. We're going to take a break. When we come back, we'll hear the entire letter that Bill Clinton wrote more than 22 years ago. Governor Clinton, I promised you this morning that I would tell our audience tonight what I told you when you and I spoke on the phone this morning at nine, namely that while I could not reveal the source who gave us the copy of your letter, that it was my impression this morning that our source had gotten it from someone at the Pentagon. I must also tell you that I got a call from that source after your press conference this morning in New Hampshire in which that person told me that indeed, it had not come from the Pentagon. He put us on to a couple of other clues that we followed up during the course of the day, and just to bring our audience fully up to date, you know I called you late this afternoon to bring you up to speed on that. Given that information, and the fact that World News Tonight got its information from Colonel Jones, who was an aide to the head of the ROTC at the University of Arkansas, do you still feel that the Bush administration bears any burden of responsibility for the release of this letter? I have no idea. I don't know what your source was, or where it came from, so I can't comment on that. I think the important thing is that the letter is consistent with everything I've been saying for the last 13 years, since I was first asked about this in late 1978. I was in the draft before the lottery came in. I gave up the deferment. I got a high lottery number and I wasn't called. That's what the records reflect. A Republican member of my draft board was given an affidavit in the last couple of days saying that I got no special treatment and nothing in that letter changes that, although it is a true reflection of the deep and conflicted feelings of a just - turned - 23 - year - old young man. I felt that at the time. And indeed, if we were electing that 23 - year - old man, what he said and thought and felt at that time would be germane. What is germane now, however, is what the 45 - or 46 - year - old Bill Clinton thinks, and when you wrote, for example, that at the time you felt perhaps that young men ought to have a chance to selectively decide whether they wanted to be conscientious objectors in a particular war. The way things are right now, I should explain to our audience, is you're either a conscientious objector across the board - you can't pick and choose, you can't say, ""I like this war,"" ""I don't like that war"". Where does Bill Clinton stand on that issue today? I have somewhat different feelings about that now. I think we ought to have a draft only when there is clear and present need, when we're going to have a lot of people in harm's way, when the volunteer army is insufficient to the task, and when there ought to be broad - based service. I do think when you have a general draft, at least there ought to be a declaration of war, so that Congress can say the broad national interests are at issue, or at least something like Senator Nunn's War Powers Act ought to be enacted. The problem we had in Vietnam was that we were ambivalent, we actually wound up weakening our military and undermining our military posture in the world for years after that. Because the country didn't support it, the people were divided, and the truth was we never really intended to, nor were we able to, win the war in any conventional sense. We had last year, obviously, a volunteer army in Operation Desert Storm. You were one of the few leading Democrats in the country who supported that operation. Let's say Bill Clinton had been president at the time, and let us just say, hypothetically, that there had been a draft in place and that several thousands or tens of thousands of young men had taken the view that young Bill Clinton took back in 1969. What would President Clinton have done about that? Well, I would have asked the Congress for an explicit expression of support through the United Nations, and I think that I would have asked, if we'd had the draft, I would have asked them to actually declare war. I think once the Congress declares war under the Constitution, then you can have a broad conscription. I think, as I said, I think it was warranted in World War II. I think, as I said, I supported the conflict in Korea. Our country has shown over and over again that large numbers of our people will voluntarily serve in the armed forces when there is broad - based support for a policy, when they understand it. That was clearly the case in Desert Storm. But Governor, before we have to take a break, and we will in a little bit less than a minute, my question was what President Clinton would have done or would have recommended to his Justice Department be done with, let's say, a few thousand young men who took the position that you took 20 - some - odd years ago, namely, ""We don't like this war, we don't think blood should be shed for oil"". Even if there had been a declaration of war, what do you do with young men like that who are acting on their conscience? Well, first of all, in a democracy I favor the kind of volunteer force that we have now. If we had had a draft, then I would have gone to the Congress and asked for an explicit declaration of war, then I would not have approved of selective conscientious objection. The problem with Vietnam all along was the ambivalence that ripped through our country, that ripped through our policy, and the fact that it was simply wrongheaded. It weakened the military, it weakened our position in the world. But in order to have - I have different views now than I did then about the appropriateness of that selective conscientious objector doctrine. But at least I think if you're going to have a draft and not allow conscientious objection on a particular basis, the United States Congress, which has the constitutional authority to declare war, ought to have to do it. Governor Clinton, we're going to have to take a break. When we come back - and again, I should tell our audience this is something I discussed with the governor this morning - we'll do a few more minutes on this subject, and then also talk about other issues. We'll continue our discussion in a moment. When you hear all the static, one way or the other, what only matters when you strip it all away is who can lead this country to greatness. Governor Clinton, back to the letter again and the timing. You wrote this letter on December 3rd of 1969. December 1st of 1969 is when your number came up in the lottery. You initially told reporters that you weren't aware of the fact that you had a high number in the lottery, then later on you told my colleague Jim Wooten that you probably did know. Which was it? Have you refreshed your memory on it? I honestly don't remember, but I think that in this day and age of instantaneous communications most people would find it difficult to believe that I did not know. I don't know whether I knew or not. If you assume I did or I didn't, it doesn't really change the letter, since I had lost my draft deferment several weeks before. I just don't know. KOPPEL The reason I ask, Governor, is because the next day, on the 2nd of December, is when you sent off your application to the Yale Law School, and then the day after that, the 3rd of December, is when you sent this letter to Colonel Holmes. And there does seem to be a sense about those two actions of someone who knew, or at least was fairly confident at that point, that he was not going to be drafted. Well, I don't think that's right. I can remember even up in the spring, as late as March of the next year, being told that I might not be able to do anything else, that I might be called in that year. We didn't know for some time that we would not be called for sure. I have no - You mean, even after you knew your number was 311, which put you - - that's right. I remember distinctly being told at some point after that - we checked at home and I was told that they couldn't say with any certainty that I could do anything other than spend another term at Oxford, that I might - I'd probably be able to stay through May, but that's all I knew. At that time, it wasn't uncommon for people to apply to graduate schools knowing that they might or might not be able to go. They might get in and then have it deferred while they were in the military service. Well, although deferment for graduate school at that point was not longer a possibility. That had been eliminated. No, no, not deferment - I mean - defer entering law school. Yes, you couldn't get a deferment. You would delay entering school while you did your service. But when I sent off the application, that's because I had been out of the ROTC program for several weeks, it wasn't an option for me anymore, I was in the draft, and so I was either going to be called or go to law school, and I didn't know for sure then. But what you're saying is that December 1, you get your high lottery number, December 2, the letter goes off to Yale Law School, December 3, you write your letter to Colonel Holmes. That's just coincidence of timing, I mean, there's nothing to read into it. I say, I just don't remember, and there's nothing to read into it. The important thing for the American people to know is that in late September, early October, sometime about that time, I think it was in September, I had talked to my stepfather, I asked him to talk to the draft board and to Colonel Holmes, asked that I be put back into the draft. I was put back into the draft before the lottery came along, before I knew my lottery number, and I was in the draft. If I had drawn number one or number 10, none of this would have happened and we wouldn't be having this conversation today. So Colonel Holmes then knew some weeks before you wrote this letter that you were, in fact, back in the draft again. He said that in The Wall Street Journal article. Even in The Wall Street Journal article he pointed out, even though with a totally different twist than he put on it for 13 years, that they participated in revoking my deferment in the fall. See, the reason I ask that, Governor, is because the last paragraph of your letter - and forgive me for being repetitive here - you say, ""I am writing to you in the hope that by telling this one story"" - no, wait a second - - no, no, no, I wanted to get a slightly different - ""I didn't mail the letter,"" you're saying, that is, the letter to the chairman of the draft board, "" ... because I didn't see, in the end, how my going in the Army and maybe going to Vietnam would achieve anything except a feeling that I had punished myself and gotten what I deserved. So I came back to England to try to make something of this second year of my Rhodes scholarship, and that is where I am now, writing to you because you've been good to me,"" and so on. That doesn't sound like the voice of a young man who expects that he is likely to be drafted. No, but look, you've got to go back and look what happened in the intervening time. Unfortunately, two of the other principals are dead, my stepfather and the head of the draft board, the only people who had any other contact. All that happened by telephone. But if you look at the records and look at what the draft board says, they point out that my deferment was withdrawn in October, I was put back in the draft pool, then the lottery came in, then I got a high draft number. And let me say this, Ted. Back in 1978, when this was first raised, I had not seen or heard from Colonel Holmes in nine years. We'd had no contact. The minute someone asked me about it, I said, ""Call Colonel Holmes"". I didn't talk to any handlers, I didn't run around and think about anything, I just said, ""Call him"". He said, ""I don't remember all the facts of that case, but if anything wrong had happened, I'd know"". In 1991 he said the same thing. There was never any negative connotation coming out of that ROTC program until The Wall Street Journal article. But even there they all admit that I lost my deferment before the lottery came in. So the bottom line is, I wasn't a draft - dodger. That guy had been good to me. I thought, since I didn't write it to the head of the draft board and since he had been good to me, I ought to lay out how I felt about all this and why, in the end, I didn't think it right to have a four - year deferment and I ought to go back into the draft. I was trying to make that case to him, and if you read the whole letter in context, I think it makes that plain. But it's consistent with everything I have said in all these years. All right. Governor Clinton, we're going to have to take another break. When we come back, I'd just like to ask you how you think this is going to play in your neck of the woods, down South, where indeed support of the Army is a stronger issue than perhaps most other parts of the country. We'll continue our discussion in a moment. I was reelected five times to run things, in tough times, with no help, by good people who heard all this stuff. If you're looking for somebody that's already been tested, you ought to go with me. Governor Clinton, this is not 1969, it's not 1978. You are now running, among other things, for the post of commander - in - chief of the United States, and while legally, technically, in every respect everything you say may be quite accurate, you know this letter has a flavor which is not going to sit well with folks down South, in particular, folks from Arkansas, among other places. How do you explain it to them again? I'm not asking you about details, I'm not asking you about technicalities, just the flavor of it. Well, let's look at it. First of all, it is the letter of a deeply agitated 23 - year - old boy, a young man. At least I was involved in the issues of my time, I cared deeply about them. That's the way I felt. If I were writing that letter today about how I felt, I'd still disagree with our policy in Vietnam but I wouldn't say the same things in the same way. Look, I was born right after the war. My father died before I was born, but he was in World War II. One of the most precious memories of my childhood is my mother trying to get me to know my dead father, showing me a presidential citation, some sort of citation he'd received for good duty in the war. I was proud of that. I wanted to be part of my country's defense and my country's service. Then I turned against the Vietnam war. I hated doing that. It was an anguishing thing for me. You can tell that from the letter. Then I became governor, commander of my National Guard. I've called out the Guard to quell a riot at Fort Chaffee. I supported the National Guard and the veterans groups of my state strongly. I supported our involvement in the Persian Gulf war. I have no doubt about my capacity to be commander - in - chief. And the fact that I didn't serve after putting myself in the lottery should not be disabling. I mean, Dick Cheney, the Secretary of Defense, had deferments all the way through. I didn't have deferments all the way through. But I think he's been a pretty good secretary of defense, I'm proud of the job he's done, and I didn't think one time during that Gulf war that he was somehow incapacitated from being the leader of the Defense Department because he'd had deferments. Governor, what's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. When Dan Quayle, when the story about his National Guard service came out, it was in the media for weeks, probably for months, I think it's fair to say. Do you think you're going to be able to put this one behind you now? I'd just like to say - point out what I said about that at the time. I said Dan Quayle ought to just tell the truth, get the facts out and let it go, you know. He was for the Vietnam war, but got into the National Guard. That wasn't an option for me. They were all full, all those slots. I was against the Vietnam war, but I gave up a deferment and put myself back into the draft. I got a high lottery number. If the people know the facts, I think they'll be all right. Let me say this. We've been talking about a letter I wrote 22 years ago as if it's a test of present presidential character. Twenty - two days ago, George Bush gave a State of the Union address, promised a tax cut for the middle class and capital gains for the wealthy. Today, 22 days later, he's up here in New Hampshire, where people are hurting, where the Food Stamp and welfare and unemployment rolls have tripled, and he says, ""Well, we're going to put off this middle - class tax cut, but I want a bigger cut for the wealthy"". I think that's a test of presidential character. If we're going to talk about 22 years ago, let's talk about my whole record as governor, my demonstrations of character, my fitness to lead and compare it to that kind of issue, which I think is very important, too. Governor, even at the risk of going a minute or two over our allotted time, I promised you you'd be able to talk about other things. You have been able now to just make that turn. During these remaining five or six days before the voters in New Hampshire go to the polls, what are you going to try to focus on? What specifically do you think most captures their needs, their attention, and what is it you're going to try to focus their attention on now? I'm going to tell them that this is an employment decision they're making. They are hiring the most important public official in the United States, and they are hurting as badly as any people in the United States. They ought to look for a person with a vision, with a plan, with a record and with a capacity to change their lives for the better. I'm going to try to give this election back to the people, to lift the cloud off of this election. For three weeks, of course, I've had some problems in the polls. All I've been asked about by the press are a woman I didn't sleep with and a draft I didn't dodge. Now I'm going to try to give them this election back, and if I can give it back to them and fight for them and fight for their future, I think we've got a chance to do well here and I know we can go beyond here and continue to take this fight to the American people. Governor Clinton, I thank you for joining us tonight. It was good of you. I know it's been a long and hard day. Thanks very much, sir.",0

1453188928945668098,Bill Clinton is a hoe he can’t help it #ImpeachmentFX,lyndon as far as i can perceive but consider that the different eras need different styles—president johnson was said to be legendary in his powers of persuasion in that he could soft pedal and strong arm like a genius—i have the idea mr clinton was more the soft pedal type of dude and you know not as intimidating that LBJ was with just his size and texan drawl—very smart dudes both indeed—the vietnam war did LBJ in and he would have accomplished so much more if we had the wisdom to either get out or install a government that the people liked—south vietnam gov was corrupt and i believe catholic in a nation of a conflicting culture - invasion of french catholics good thing! continuing mistakes of former french colonizers just continued,0
1453188928945668098,Bill Clinton is a hoe he can’t help it #ImpeachmentFX,"Lyndon Johnson by far. He was not only shrewd, he was boorish a bully and untrustworthy. In essence, he was the consummate politician. Bill Clinton played the party boy and chased women, but he was more interested in the perks of the office than the power and prestige. He was a poster boy for political debauchery but not a serious politician. On the other hand, his wife Hillary was a female Lyndon Johnson without even as much charm as ole Lyndon.",0
1453188928945668098,Bill Clinton is a hoe he can’t help it #ImpeachmentFX,"lyndon johnson was the consummate old style pol. he took big chances, like with the civil rights act and the war on poverty, and he had a big vision. he was coarse and rednecky but he was a good president, overall. i always thought clinton was a lightweight who just lucked into a fat time in our country’s history.",0
1453188928945668098,Bill Clinton is a hoe he can’t help it #ImpeachmentFX,"If by “shrewd,” you mean conniving and treacherous, I would say Slick. LBJ was a crude, boorish bully, but he wasn’t clever enough to be the flim-flam man BJ Clinton was. Where Mr. Bill was a fox, LBJ was a cape buffalo.",0
1453188928945668098,Bill Clinton is a hoe he can’t help it #ImpeachmentFX,"I don’t know if you can say if one was more shrewd than the other. Clinton was better educated, but Johnson was in politics longer. Johnson wielded his power as president like a club, but he had his moments. Clinton was more subtle. So……",0
1453188928945668098,Bill Clinton is a hoe he can’t help it #ImpeachmentFX,"Lyndon. He saw through the Kennedys in a way that Bill Clinton never could. And Johnson would never have let his pecker get in the way of being President. Like Bill Clinton with his young ‘hoe Monica, did.",0
1453188928945668098,Bill Clinton is a hoe he can’t help it #ImpeachmentFX,"Neither, actually. Johnson obeyed his generals and escalated the Vietnam War. Clinton was hamstrung by Congress, but still rarely proposed anything progressive.",0
1453188928945668098,Bill Clinton is a hoe he can’t help it #ImpeachmentFX,"LBJ was a lot more underhanded and power lustful.LBJ got paid very well under the table for doing favors for wealthy constituents.LBJ didnt like to be double crossed and if you did, well too bad for you.LBJ and Bill Clinton were from poor circumstances as young people, and this often creates a lust for money once they get the opportunity.",0
1453188928945668098,Bill Clinton is a hoe he can’t help it #ImpeachmentFX,"Who was more shrewd, Lyndon B. Johnson or Bill Clinton?",0
1453188928945668098,Bill Clinton is a hoe he can’t help it #ImpeachmentFX,Johnson is among the most corrupt politicians of the last ninety years. Clinton isn’t even in the same world of back room criminal behavior as Johnson took for granted.,0
1453188928945668098,Bill Clinton is a hoe he can’t help it #ImpeachmentFX,"While Johnson was cunning, Clinton was shrewd. Johnson died worth about fifteen million dollars. His estate is probably worth some multiple of that now. Johnson was small time, a sort of little criminal.",0
1453188928945668098,Bill Clinton is a hoe he can’t help it #ImpeachmentFX,"Clinton let himself get rolled by Bob Rubin and my money says Rubin clued him in to the possibilities of going along to get along. In less that two years working with the man from Goldman Sachs Clinton had totally abandoned everything he ran on to let Rubin run the country through Clinton, mush as Don Regan’s Wall Street Trust ran the US through Reagan.",0
1453188928945668098,Bill Clinton is a hoe he can’t help it #ImpeachmentFX,"At one point less than ten years out of office the Clintons were worth more than a hundred million dollars. Neither of them ever invented anything, improved a patentable process, or created a private sector job.",0
1453188928945668098,Bill Clinton is a hoe he can’t help it #ImpeachmentFX,That takes shrewdness.,0
1453188928945668098,Bill Clinton is a hoe he can’t help it #ImpeachmentFX,"If you mean is she personally responsible for it, the answer is no. The State Department is massive, and things like individual security arrangements for an embassy are delegated down the food chain to subordinates, who then pass it down to their subordinates and so on. No single Secretary of State could micromanage every infinitesimal detail, even if one tried, it would be impossible for one person to sort through communications, cables, memos, reports coming in from all the offices and embassies around the world. Even if a dozen meth-heads worked around the clock with an infinite supply, they too couldn’t manage a fraction of it.",0
1453188928945668098,Bill Clinton is a hoe he can’t help it #ImpeachmentFX,"In the case of Benghazi, it’s hard to see how a single individual is responsible. It might be politically expedient for politicians to try, if you remember during the 2012 Vice-Presidential debate, right after the attack, Joe Biden [ http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/12/politics/fact-check-benghazi-security/ ] and Democrats [ https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/barbara-boxers-claim-that-gop-budgets-hampered-benghazi-security/2013/05/15/d1e295cc-bdb0-11e2-97d4-a479289a31f9_blog.html ] blamed Republicans because they claimed the budget passed by a Republican Congress cut Embassy Security funding by hundreds of millions. But do I blame Paul Ryan for Benghazi because he headed the budget committee? No, of course not, just like I don’t blame Clinton. It isn’t that simple.",0
1453188928945668098,Bill Clinton is a hoe he can’t help it #ImpeachmentFX,"She is blamed, as others point out, because Republicans want to kneecap her bid for the presidency.",0
1453188928945668098,Bill Clinton is a hoe he can’t help it #ImpeachmentFX,"1. Her responsibility for security for State Department properties is basically nil. Security requests are likely handled by career government employees.
2. 
1. These types of requests are generally handled at a pretty low level.",0
1453188928945668098,Bill Clinton is a hoe he can’t help it #ImpeachmentFX,"3. It would be a poor use of her time to decide security levels for all State properties.
4. The primary request for security for the Benghazi villa was a note in February. It asked for FIVE DSG guards. That was to protect an estimated 3 State personnel.
5. 
1. As near as I can tell, the security profile was not met, because the villa was never used: nobody was stationed there, so there were no guards needed.",0
1453188928945668098,Bill Clinton is a hoe he can’t help it #ImpeachmentFX,"6. On the day of the attack there were FIVE DSG guards there, exactly the number requested.
7. The Ambassador himself decided on his security detail. The Ambassador specifically did not want a large detail. 
8. 
1. The Ambassador apparently did not like large security details because he felt it was important to encourage access. He was very familiar with the country and one of the leading experts on the situation on the ground.",0
1453188928945668098,Bill Clinton is a hoe he can’t help it #ImpeachmentFX,"9. There were a number of other general requests for more security for Libya. What is not known is how many requests other hot spots had for more security. State Department officials had to balance out security according to the budget.
10. The Republicans cut the budget for State security.  
11. State does not and should not supply security for the CIA.
12. 
1. The CIA annex was separate. Although the ambassador was probably aware of it, he was also not responsible for it and would generally be required to deny knowledge of it.",0
1453188928945668098,Bill Clinton is a hoe he can’t help it #ImpeachmentFX,"13. After the attacks, the rescue and response units were either coordinated on the ground there, or by the Department of Defense, which Hillary had no control over.",0
1453188928945668098,Bill Clinton is a hoe he can’t help it #ImpeachmentFX,"Hillary Clinton was in a far less advantageous position to prevent Benghazi than George W. Bush was to prevent 9/11.  You can either blame both of them, or neither of them.  Anything else is blind partisanship.",0
1453188928945668098,Bill Clinton is a hoe he can’t help it #ImpeachmentFX,No more so than the 13 attacks during Bush's administration were considered to be his fault.,0

1453188928945668098,Bill Clinton is a hoe he can’t help it #ImpeachmentFX,"She isn't. Everyone knows that the attacks were done by people who were in Libya. There were two different things interacting at the time. There was an intentionally offensive video that had become known to the Arab world that managed to set off a few riots. At the same time, there was an anti-democracy group in Libya, trying to fight to stop the Libya from having a functioning democratic government. It appears that the insurgents used the riot (or created a riot) as an opportunity to attack the American consulate in Benghazi.",0
1453188928945668098,Bill Clinton is a hoe he can’t help it #ImpeachmentFX,"As Republicans have noted, there are many Republicans who think that they will harm Secretary Clinton's chances of being elected to the presidency by attempting to tie her to the deaths of these men. Of course those same people who want to make a political issue of Benghazi take umbrage if it is pointed out that hundreds of marines died in Lebanon while Reagan was president.",0
1453188928945668098,Bill Clinton is a hoe he can’t help it #ImpeachmentFX,"I’m going to answer this question with a joke: It was when Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans. Before the storm, residents were warned to get out. But “Ol’ Joe” said, “Naw, I put my faith in the Lord.” Later, when the waters were rising, a boat staffed by rescue workers came by and tried to get Joe to leave. “Naw,” Joe repeated, “I put my faith in the Lord.” Still later, when a helicopter crew spotted Joe clinging to his roof, he waved them away, still shouting his faith in the Lord. That was the last anyone in this life saw of Ol’ Joe. But he wasn’t done. Next, there he was, sopping wet and standing before St. Peter, looking for admittance to heaven. And Joe was furious! “I put my faith in the Lord, and look what happened to me,” he fumed.",0
1453188928945668098,Bill Clinton is a hoe he can’t help it #ImpeachmentFX,"“What?” St. Peter replied, “The Lord sent you three opportunities to be rescued and you rejected all of them! Don’t blame God.”",0
1453188928945668098,Bill Clinton is a hoe he can’t help it #ImpeachmentFX,"So what does this have to do with Hillary? Everything. Except she played God and failed. She had prior knowledge of the attack, and did nothing. She had multiple requests and opportunities to rescue the ambassador and the soldiers, and did nothing. She made up a lie about “why” the attack occurred and sent an innocent man to prison as a cover-up. This is the “something” that she did that she shouldn’t have.",0
1453188928945668098,Bill Clinton is a hoe he can’t help it #ImpeachmentFX,"This, then, is why Hillary is rightfully blamed for Benghazi and why she should be indicted and tried. If this was treason, as opposed to mere self-serving incompetence, she deserves execution if convicted.",0
1453188928945668098,Bill Clinton is a hoe he can’t help it #ImpeachmentFX,"This type of question makes me cringe. Benghazi is nothing more than a dog whistle code name for Fox channel and far right-wing conservatives to attack Hillary Clinton. Even though she testified more than once under oath, even though no charges were brought against her. But the bottom line is it worked. Notice how once Trump was elected Bhengazi is dropped. And DJT does not let many things slide by where he does not attack, particularly with the HRC name attached. DJT and the Republicans are looking for a Benghazi equivalent for the 2020 election. Stay tuned.",0
1453188928945668098,Bill Clinton is a hoe he can’t help it #ImpeachmentFX,Sec. Clinton is not being blamed for the attacks in Benghazi. The thrust of the investigation is to determine who was steering the ship of government in the Executive branch 56 days before a national election.,0
1453188928945668098,Bill Clinton is a hoe he can’t help it #ImpeachmentFX,"While some could argue that proper security was not in place despite 600 requests, the questions center on what happened during and after the attack. Sec. Clinton's testimony on October 22 before the House Select Committee brought out the FACT that is was immediately known that it was an ""al Qaeda-like terrorist attack"" and not a protest spurred by an ""offensive video.""

The American public has an interest in knowing why this ""Internet video"" story was then promulgated by the White House and the State Department for weeks, including an address by the President before the United Nations. Did the White House and the State Department place a higher value on closing ranks over a false narrative than admitting a security failure at a VERY INOPPORTUNE TIME?",0
1453188928945668098,Bill Clinton is a hoe he can’t help it #ImpeachmentFX,"An inopportune time because a national election loomed in less than 2 months and the polling suggested a tight race. The Obama Campaign had staked some of its political capital on sloganeering like:
 * ""Osama Bin Laden is Dead and General Motors is Alive""
 * “Today, al Qaeda is on the run and Osama bin Laden is dead.”",0
1453188928945668098,Bill Clinton is a hoe he can’t help it #ImpeachmentFX,"How devastating for the Obama campaign to suffer an al Qaeda-like attack on the anniversary of the September 11 attacks [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks ].

1453188928945668098,Bill Clinton is a hoe he can’t help it #ImpeachmentFX,Why has she been blamed for them? Because members of the GOP want to blame her.

Sad that they continue wasting this country’s money in order to try and pin something illegal on her.,0
1453188928945668098,Bill Clinton is a hoe he can’t help it #ImpeachmentFX,"Actually, I’ve never heard anyone make the claim the Hillary Clinton ‘caused’ Benghazi. However, it seems most Republicans blame Ms. Clinton because a heroic, well meaning Ambassador chose to go to an unprotected and very dangerous area unprotected, to further America’s interest and help calm the unrest. They also blame her because Ms. Rice blamed the incident on a video, which it seems the CIA suggested that she do.",0

First of all, you talked about if and how the Ministry is influencing Percy. One thing that caught my attention is that at the beginning of Book 4, Percy is working on a report on cauldron bottoms. Then at the end of the book, Voldemort emerges from the cauldron. There seems to be a link and it makes me wonder what side the Minister is on. The next thing that I would like to mention is the occurrence at the end of the your character discussion about choosing a girl. I personally believe the Weasleys are descendants from Godric Gryffindor, so they needed a girl to continue the bloodline. Lastly, I would like to say something about spoilers. We all think that we try to avoid them, but at the same time we watch movie clips before the movie is released, highlight the text on MuggleNet without really thinking, and look ahead in the books. In a way, it’s just part of the experience. Even though I hate to be spoiled, I’ll admit they do play an important part in the fandom.",0

I remember in your last show when you talked about Moody, you talked about how you thought his magical eye came from the Ministry of Magic. However, in Order of the Phoenix when Harry goes to the Ministry and talks to Kingsley Shacklebolt, there is a witch with an eye patch. And I thought that if she had lost an eye like Moody the Ministry would have provided her one too, if they had provided one for Moody. Also, Moody did not have his eye patch when he was in the first scene for Harry in the Pensieve for Goblet of Fire, but he did in the second scene. Thanks!",0

When listening to Episode 44, I found it rather offensive when Eric and the others began wondering why anybody would ever have seven kids. I have several friends who have seven or even eight children in their family. And once you actually have such a large family, each person becomes their own individual and numbers become irrelevant. In fact, despite the fact that they weren’t wealthy, some of my friends even wish that their parents would have a ninth child.

But then, further on in the riddle, “But past an hour–the prospect’s black…” – Sirius Black – “Too late, it’s gone it won’t come back.” And this is sort of in relation to Harry – er, Sirius falling into the veil, and he fell back into it.

1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,Andrew: That’s what she made a reference to. Anyone else know about that?,0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Greg: I hadn’t heard anything of it until I read this article. So, nope.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Andrew: Basically, each potion represented each Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. I guess with – I don’t even know [laughs]. I tried looking it up but I couldn’t find anything.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,Micah: That was just another example of how Jo had hidden things in earlier books? Or…,0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Andrew: And so what she’s saying is this – the Merpeople’s riddle could possibly foreshadow what we will see in Book 7 because, obviously, it didn’t happen in Book 5 or 6 yet. Yeah, it’s very interesting. And we will include a link in the “Show Notes” so everyone can take a look at it and read it through. It’s very detailed. She definitely did her research. Who’s this girl? Kristie E.R. It’s her pen name.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Andrew: So, another question we have here: What clues has Dumbledore left for Harry, if any, and will we see him or Sirius again? Go ahead, explain it, Ben.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Ben: Well, JK Rowling mentioned that Sirius was given – Sirius gave Harry the two-way mirrors and she said that it might hold more significance in the future books. So, I don’t know if it means that Harry will be able to communicate with him beyond the veil, or what exactly it means.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Andrew: But will – what about seeing Dumbledore again? Or, what clues has Dumbledore left for Harry? I think that Dumbledore hasn’t really left any clues for Harry because he told him everything he needed to know in Book 6, and basically, he said – and I think he thinks that it’s Harry’s time to figure this out all on his own. And I’m sure he has full confidence in him. Greg, do you think Dumbledore’s left any clues for Harry?",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Greg: It’s possible. It’s one of those things that – I mean, we have one book left and at this point, I’m just thinking, theories, who cares? We’re going to read the next book and it’ll all be over. So, I absolutely – I have no opinion on that. I’ll be a nice little politician here.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Andrew: [laughs] Micah, has Dumbledore left any clues for Harry?",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Micah: I agree with what you said. I think he taught him a lot. And it all depends really – this is what we were talking about yesterday. If he had any time to plan before his death, and if he knew what was going to happen in the end. If he took any steps to leave certain clues for him behind.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Andrew: But what about Sirius? Anything else besides the two-way mirror? I mean, it’s been a whole book now and I think we would have seen something by now. I don’t think it’s just going to pop up in Book 7.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Greg: When we’re introduced to something, such as an Animagus, or something like that, we’re given time to think about it. Such as in Book 1, we’re shown what an Animagus is. In Book 3, we’re given a lot of detail. So, perhaps that is why Book 6 had nothing to do – didn’t tell you about the mirrors, because she wanted you to kind of think about it for a while. And then she’ll throw it back in there in Book 7. Because she does that a lot.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Andrew: Yeah, good point. And thatís really the reason why this whole Harry Potter community with theories and speculation and groups of analysis and all that have really spawned, because she gives us all this time to think about it, rather than just at the beginning of the book, some new thing, such as the two-way mirror pops up, and then at the end of the book, itís already answered. She gives us time. Thatís the beauty of it.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,Andrew: Thank you. Iím here all week.,0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Andrew: Next question: We wanted to revisit Horcruxes again. We talked about them a lot in the beginning of the early days of MuggleCast as it was right after Book 6, and we were all like, [deep gasp] “Horcruxes are so cool!”",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Andrew: [laughs] So, so, now we wanted to revisit exactly what Dumbledore said when he listed where he thought they – where he thought the final Horcruxes were, or all the Horcruxes were in Half-Blood Prince: Tom Riddle’s diary, Gaunt’s ring, Slytherin’s locket, Hufflepuff’s cup. So, what of Gryffindor’s, what of Ravenclaw’s, and Nagini? So, what could it be of Gryffindor’s, Greg?",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Greg: Could it be the Sorting Hat? I think that’s something many people have already come up with, but it could easily be anything that Dumbledore owned, or just anything in the castle. But then, it could have been the sword of Godric Gryffindor. It could have been that hat.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Greg: It could have been anything. Who knows? Since Nagini was already a Horcrux, maybe it could be Fawkes? Who knows?",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,Ben: Do we actually know Nagini is a Horcrux?,0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Greg: Well, we don’t, but we speculate.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Ben: One theory with the Sorting Hat is that when Voldemort goes in Dumbledore’s office in Half-Blood Prince to interview for the Defense Against the Dark Arts teaching job, there’s this part where he has a flick of his wrist, and many people think that he might have made the Sorting Hat or something in Dumbledore’s office a Horcrux at that time.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,Micah: But my question about that is wouldn’t he have just had to have killed somebody in order to do that?,0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Ben: We have to see that. We don’t know the process that goes into actually making a Horcrux, if you understand what I’m saying.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Micah: Yeah. That’s a good point. I was just assuming that somebody would have to have been killed, and then you would have to do it immediately as opposed to taking some time. I donít think we know anything really about Ravenclaw.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Andrew: Well, it would probably be – it would probably be an artifact, wouldn’t it be? Because we have Slytherin’s locket and then Hufflepuff’s cup. So, from each house, it must be some important item of – it would be something in Rowena’s possession, or was in her possession.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Micah: So, something with like an R encrusted on it, or…",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Micah: I guess it says here that Ravenclaw’s symbol, judging from the Hogwarts crest, is a bronze eagle. So, maybe something that’s lying around the school that…",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Andrew: Right. Now, as for Nagini. I mean, Nagini is not official, but the reason that everyone seems to think that it’s Nagini is because Nagini is Voldemort’s giant snake that he’s really attached to. But I’m…",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,Micah: And that Dumbledore himself brought it up as a possibility.,0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Andrew: And what else could be a possible Horcrux? What about Harry? What do you guys think about the whole Harry-being-a-Horcrux thing, when he cursed him that fine day?",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,Ben: JK Rowling said that Harry couldn’t be a Horcrux on her website.,0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Greg: She didn’t say his scar was, though, did she? Could some individual part…",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,Greg: … of him could be?,0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,Andrew: Yeah. Is the scar a part of him? Part of him?,0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,Micah: One thing that works well for that is Dumbledore thought that Voldemort had only created six Horcruxes up until the night that the Potters were killed. So…,0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,Andrew: I don’t remember that. When did he say that?,0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Andrew: Well, duh [laughs], but I mean, like…",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Micah: I don’t have a page number. I can try to find it, though.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,Andrew: All right. I guess it doesn’t really matter.,0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Micah: But the Lexicon lists a couple others, and they’re usually pretty good.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Micah: One was the Basilisk from The Chamber of Secrets, and they like that because it is extremely long-lived and well hidden.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Micah: Or it was, anyway.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,Micah: And the other one was Wormtail’s silver hand right after he killed Cedric.,0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,Andrew: I don’t know. It doesn’t seem like – I don’t understand.,0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,Micah: That – I don’t like that one.,0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Andrew: Me, neither, because Wormtail is Voldemort’s assistant, and I don’t think Voldemort has enough trust in him to have Wormtail actually protect a Horcrux. Would Wormtail even know it?",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,Micah: No. Probably not.,0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Andrew: That would be a nice final debt to Harry, giving him the Horcrux. Hmmm? Hmmm?",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Andrew: What will happen with Draco Malfoy? Because he seems to care for his parents very much, and he was scared and indecisive in the outcome of Half-Blood Prince. Can anything change his perspective about the war? I certainly do not think so, because at this point, he is too corrupt to continue on as a normal wizard.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Ben: Well, someone brought up the fact that Draco is actually Latin for, “Dragon,” and they say you can’t tame a dragon, so it makes sense for him to go…",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Andrew: So, are you saying…",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,Andrew: …he’s going to get a big dragon? [laughs],0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Ben: No, I’m saying that it makes sense for him to go against what his parents are saying, because he can’t be tamed.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Greg: He could go the other way, though.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,Greg: That he can’t be tamed by the good side.,0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,Andrew: Right. And who’s he going to side with on the good side? It’s too late.,0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Micah: See, I don’t know. I tend to think that if something happened to his mother, he may react in a different way, because even throughout the earlier books, you saw he has a very strong relationship with her, and I’m inclined to think that instead of killing him, if Voldemort kills Narcissa because Draco failed to do his task with Dumbledore, we might see him revolt potentially.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Andrew: I don’t know. I just – I mean, back to my question. How would he – who would he side with on the good side?",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Micah: Well, is Snape truly evil? I mean…",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,Micah: I think that would play a role in it.,0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Andrew: Okay, but if he sided with Snape, who’s Snape going side with? Say that three times fast. There’s no one. And Harry’s going try to kill him anyway.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,The Role of the Ministry,0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Andrew: Now, what role will the Ministry play, if any, in Book 7? I think the Ministry, too, is too corrupt to possibly be involved with trying to kill off Dumbledore, especially since Lucius is in the Ministry and Lucius is going – Lucius, now, Lucius is in Azkaban now. What am I thinking? I am one uninformed fan!",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Andrew: Did they? Did Lucius? Oh, okay. But still, Lucius has no opinion in the Ministry of Magic anymore. He has no influence, I wouldn’t think. Unless he threatened Scrimgeour. Greg, what do you think? What role is the Ministry going to play?",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Greg: It’s hard to tell, and that seems to be my answer for everything tonight…",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,Greg: …but my guess is not much.,0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Greg: My guess is not much. Harry’s going to be really distracted, but unless Harry becomes a fugitive, I don’t think much is going to happen with them.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Greg: They might just be a fly in his face or something, or you know, a gnat? Just in his ear.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,Greg: Just something annoying him the entire time.,0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Andrew: I would have to agree. What did you mean by the question what’s Scrimgeour’s deal, Micah?",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Micah: Well, are we going to see him at all, or did he just kind of play out his role in Book 6? I mean with Fudge gone, I think Scrimgeour brings a little more credibility to…",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,Andrew: I think anyone who replaces…,0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Andrew: …Fudge could bring more credibility, because Fudge was a you-know-what! I would say it, but we are not on Episode 44 anymore.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Andrew: Where will the final battle take place? I’m going to have to put it in a scenic spot. I’m going to say the Hogwarts grounds. It would be very emotional for both Harry and Voldemort. What do you think, Micah?",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Micah: Yeah, I was just going to say…",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,Greg: Godric’s Hollow would be an interesting place.,0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Andrew: That would be emotional, too.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,Andrew: Yes. Especially since Harry hasn’t been there since his parents’ deaths. That would be very emotional.,0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Andrew: Now it’s time for this week’s Gimme A Butterbeer segment, once again with Benjamin Schoen. Take it away, Benny Boy!",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Ben: Well, I’d like to thank everyone for all the feedback I received on last week’s topic about Harry Potter spoilers. Thank you, and remember to continue to send your feedback to ben at staff dot mugglenet dot com. This week’s Gimme A Butterbeer is going to be different than Butterbeers that we’ve had in the past weeks. Rather than myself going on a rant about, you know, some issue that’s involved in Harry Potter, I’m going to bring up a topic and then open it up for debate and discussion with the rest of the group.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"We all know that each and every one of us likes to have our privacy. Just a few nights ago, the CBS’s hit TV show Big Brother made its season premiere, and sometimes for celebrities, it always seems like Big Brother is watching. Recently, we have seen several pictures of actresses and actors from the Harry Potter movies, and these images are indeed from their personal lives. I was curious to see what you guys thought about this and whether it should be stopped. I’m Ben Schoen, and I say, “Gimme A Butterbeer!”",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Andrew: In some ways, I sort of think that the actors and actresses bring it onto themselves, especially when they are acknowledging the camera, right there in front of them.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Andrew: You know, they’re smiling or waving, you know while…",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Ben: Yeah, well, you know, like I said in my commentary…",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Andrew: Please let me finish. [laughs] Now I forget what I was saying. Oh, when they’re doing illegal activities. And then these pictures get out, and then it’s a whole big spiel, and then they wonder, [Fake crying] “Why did they get out they’re going to ruin my reputation!” But it’s their fault for doing it.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Ben: Well, what I was trying to say, is that it’s one thing if their private lives are literally being invaded, and it’s another thing if they’re in a public setting and they’re partaking in illegal activity. Those are two different things. It’s different if it’s paparazzi than if it’s a case where their friends take a picture of them, and they may not like them, and they put it online. Micah, Greg? Micah, Greg? Tanny? What’s up? What do you guys think?",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Greg: Well, frankly, I think that if they’re out in public, I don’t see why people would get so upset about, “Oooh, snapshot of you laughing.”",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Greg: It’s like come on. Who cares? I mean, if you’re doing something in your house and somebody starts filming you from a window, then there’s a problem, but… [laughs]",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Greg: … that’s not the case here. So, otherwise, I just don’t see it as being a problem. When there’s a camera in front of you, don’t do something stupid.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Micah: Yeah, no, I agree with Greg. I think when you’re out in public – you’re a celebrity. That’s, unfortunately, part of what comes with it. And there’s always going to cameras around, so it’s kind of your own responsibility to watch what you do. When you’re in private, if that’s still going on, I personally have a problem with that. I don’t think that that’s right. But if you’re out, and you’re doing things that you shouldn’t be doing, and you get caught on camera, you’ve got nobody to blame but yourself.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Andrew: On the other hand, people wonder why the paparazzi do it, and as Ben said in his Butterbeer, why does the paparazzi do this, and why are they so into it? I mean, the paparazzi – these pictures sell. They sell big time. I mean, look in the recent headlines. Ah, what’s their names? Tom – [laughs] You know! You know!",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Andrew: No, no, no, not those two! Brad Pitt and uhhh…[laughs]",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Andrew: Wow, I’m up on my celebrity. Yes. Yeah, those two. They sold their baby’s pictures for what, four million dollars?",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Andrew: To one of those tabloid magazines. It’s amazing how these pictures sell, and it’s amazing how people are so obsessed with celebrities lives because, maybe there’s something in these normal people’s real lives that they always cling on to celebrities so much. But, it sells and that’s why the paparazzi is so obsessed with doing this. It is a shame, but…",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Micah: Well, I mean all you have to do to learn and to see how badly they just want to take pictures, is to look at what happened with Princess Diana. And her life was taken as a result of it.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Greg: Well, look at Britney Spears. [laughs] That’s all that I have to say about that.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Andrew: White trash. [laughs] Yeah. No, Britney Spears is abused by this, too, and she was on the…",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,Greg: Well she’s a – do you think she seriously doesn’t know that people are watching her when she was stuffing her baby on the corner…,0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Ben: Dashboard. [laughs] No, what I’m saying is, don’t you think sometimes, like in the case of the recent pictures that we’ve seen online, that there is no such thing as bad publicity? Do you think that’s true? Micah, you’re a media man. Do you think that’s true? That they’re still getting attention, whether it’s good or bad? And some people, you know, particularly their fans, may like them more because they’re doing the cool thing or whatever.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Micah: No, I think there are definitely instances where any media, no matter good or bad, is still, in essence, a good thing because your name, or your product, or whatever, is still getting out there. And, you know, a lot of times, as a result of bad media attention, you get people who write in – you get people who respond to it and say, “No, this isn’t the case,” or, “Why are you doing that?” So – and often times people’s attitudes can change as a result. I mean, I don’t know if it’s necessarily the case with these pictures. I haven’t seen these pictures, so I don’t necessarily know what exactly was depicted in them.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Andrew: But, I think there is such thing as bad publicity. Bad publicity can seriously affect someone. I can’t really think of someone specifically, but I mean – and I wish I had an example, but one picture or two pictures could reveal something of an actor or actress that totally ruins their lives.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Andrew: Okay, so that was this week’s Gimme A Butterbeer segment. Thanks again, Benjamin.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,Andrew: Now it is time for this week’s voicemail questions. They are back this week thanks to Kevin finally getting his act together.,0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"[Audio]: Hi, I’m Michelle from Florida, and I wanted to pose a theory on Harry finding the Horcruxes. If Voldemort puts a piece of his soul into each Horcrux, one which Dumbledore believed to be Nagini, and then if Harry can Legilimens his way into the fragmented soul of Voldemort and also Nagini during the attack on Arthur Weasley, couldn’t Harry use Legilimancy to find the rest of the Horcruxes by connecting with the other fragments of Voldemort’s soul?",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Ben: The answer is no, and here’s why. The first reason is because, in order to accomplish Legilimens (however you say it), you must be able to make eye contact with the person and then be able to read their thoughts and stuff that way. And it would be kind of hard for Harry to make eye contact with a Horcrux. And the reason that Harry was able to get into Voldemort’s mind really wasn’t Legilimens, it was the fact that he had the Horcrux – not the Horcrux, excuse me, the scar on his forehead. So, that’s what allowed him to enter Voldemort’s mind. Not really Legilimency.",0

1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"[Audio]: Hi, this is Kelsey from Indianapolis, Indiana. In Half-Blood Prince, Trelawney tells Harry that she remembers Snape being thrown out of the Hog’s Head during her interview with Dumbledore, but if it were true that Snape only heard half of the prophecy, she shouldn’t have remembered him at all. I find that very suspicious. Do you think there’s something about that interview that Dumbledore never told Harry? Thanks, love the show! Bye!",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Micah: Wouldn’t Trelawney know, though? I mean she got interrupted, so obviously she’s going to know who’s outside the door, no?",0

1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Micah: I don’t think Dumbledore – I think Dumbledore was completely honest with Harry once he sat down and he told him everything that happened that night. I don’t think he left any information out. Yeah, I think once Snape got caught outside, Dumbledore obviously opened the door or whoever opened the door, so that’s why Trelawney knew that Snape was there.",0

I’m from a suburb outside Chicago called [inaudible] and I was just wondering, you know, me being 17 and loving Harry Potter, and you guys are all around the same age – do you guys ever get made fun of, because I know I do all the time? Love to hear what you guys say. Love your show! Bye!",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,Andrew: Too bad Eric’s not on the show. I’m sure he would have some good stories about this.,0

1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Andrew: Because I tell people about MuggleNet and they say, “That is cool, Andrew. Do you want to go do something?”",0

1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Andrew: Just tell them – just tell them that you met the actors, and that you work for the biggest Harry Potter fan-site online, and then ask us to put up a little fake bio about you on MuggleNet, and then you can totally trick them out, and then they’ll think it’s cool. Micah, are you a subject of bullying?",0

1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Greg: When I wear Harry Potter t-shirts to school, I’ll get some remarks like, “Oh, you like Harry Potter? You’re so immature! How old are you?” It’s like, “Hey, you Snape-ing Horcrux!…",0

1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"[Audio]: Hey guys, what’s up? This is [inaudible]. I’m 15 years old, and I’m a country girl living in a California world. First of all, I’d like to say that love at first sight can be about a podcast, too. I’m dangerously in love with MuggleCast, and you guys are awesome! My question for you guys is about memories. When a witch or wizard extracts a memory from someone else, like when Slughorn removed his own memory about Horcruxes from his mind, is this specific memory permanently gone from that person? Is it vanished from their mind to where they don’t even know they’ve experienced it? Or is the memory that is extracted more like a copy of the memory, so that person still has his or her memory? Thank you so very much, and Laura rocks my socks!",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Ben: Okay I’m pretty sure that – no she doesn’t. [laughs] I’m pretty sure that it’s just a copy of the memory because that wouldn’t make sense. Because Dumbledore has a lot of memories in his Pensieve, so that would be like half his brain, and that just doesn’t make sense.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Micah: Yeah, and in reference to Slughorn, I think when you look at what happened in Half-Blood Prince, when they’re showing the memory from the Pensieve, it’s a distorted memory, but when Harry goes to talk to Slughorn, and he – he actually recounts everything that went on with Tom Riddle. He tells Harry all about the Horcruxes. So, if it was just extracted and then – Slughorn wouldn’t have been able to recall anything, right? Dumbledore would have had the full memory himself, and Slughorn would have just been staring at Harry, you know, saying, basically, “What the heck are you talking about?” So, I agree with Ben. It’s just a copy.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"[Audio]: Hey, this is Jennifer from Massachusetts, and first I’d love to say that I love MuggleCast, it’s amazing! And my question, I don’t know if it’s already been answered, but do you think anybody else, besides Voldemort, has Horcruxes? Okay! Thanks, bye!",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Ben: I think it’s pretty obvious – I bet that someone else had to have done it before, just that it really wasn’t that common. I don’t know. Maybe they knew the magic existed, and that someone has experimented with it, but I doubt anyone was really ever using it along the same lines that Voldemort was, which was to achieve immortality and basically stay alive forever. I doubt there has really been any evil wizard that’s done it before. Because I bet there are some – it’s kind of like drinking unicorn blood. You end up with a cursed life. I bet there’s something bad that happens with…",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Micah: You have a few lying around, don’t you, Ben? Just for safekeeping?",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,Ben: Yeah. Three or four.,0

1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Andrew: You can sell it on eBay. Oh, that’d be a great MuggleCast fund raiser. No? Nothing?",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Greg: Oh, gosh, have you seen the Horcrux? The official Horcrux on eBay?",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,Andrew: I think I remember that. I think we posted it.,0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,Andrew: We were suckered in enough.,0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Andrew: Well, now it is time to do another “This Week in Potter,” as it is now the summer months here on MuggleCast. A lot of things have happened involving the Harry Potter books and films over the summer, so it is only right that we do another “This Week in Potter.” This week, on July – oh, no, sorry, June 29th. Was it June 29th? I should have my links open. I’m a bad host. Harry Potter – the title of Harry Potter Book Six was released to the world by JK Rowling herself, all because of the Pillar of Storgé. What originally happened was: the rumor someone posted on the forums claiming that they were just clicking around the site, and they ran into something to unlock the Room of Requirement. And then, he got the title of Book Six, along with a little explanation from Jo. Long story short: JK Rowling made a post in her Rumor Section, saying Book Six is called Pillar of Storgé (that was the rumor). And then, she says, “I’m trying very hard not to feel offended that anyone thought this was possible. Storgé, for crying out loud. Come on people, get a grip.” Well, a video got out too, of him unlocking it, and that’s when people started believing it. But then there was some skepticism, because the writing wasn’t exactly Jo’s style, and some of it was written in English.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Ben: Hey, Greg. Greg. Didn’t you rush and buy harrypotterandthepillarofstorgé.net or something?",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,Ben: I could have sworn that was you.,0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,Andrew: He just doesn’t want to admit it.,0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Greg: It wasn’t. I almost – actually almost did, but right before I did, the real title came out.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,Andrew: Oh. [laughs] And then you went and…,0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Greg: I tried to buy halfbloodprince.com, but it was taken.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Andrew: Oh gee, I wonder why.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,Greg: In every form. There was halfbloodprince.tv.us. Everything was taken.,0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Andrew: It’s a shame. We actually had planned for Matthew Vines to be on the episode this week, but then we had to change the recording date and he couldn’t make it. But, he actually wrote the post on MuggleNet.com, explaining why this Pillar of Storgé was not the title. Like he had several reasons why. Because there was so much – the community just burst with this excitement and all this theorizing, and speculation, and all that.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"And then Jo made a nice, long explanation when she announced the real title, saying, “I was delighted to see that a hardcore of super-bright fans knew that the real title was once, in the long distant past, a possibility for Chamber of Secrets.” And from that deduced it was genuine. Some crucial pieces of information in Book Six were originally planned for Chamber of Secrets, and very early on, in the first draft of Chamber, I realized that this information’s proper home was Book Six. I’ve said that before, and that Chamber holds some very important clues to the ultimate end of the series. Not as many as Six, obviously, but there is a link.” End quote.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Andrew: So, I wanted to talk about a little something else now, relating to titles for Book Seven. It was noted that Harry Potter – and this is very, very, very debatable. It was noted that Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince was actually trademarked in the UK patent office back in 2003, and Jo made this announcement a year later. And the reason that Warner Brothers trademarked that name, and so many others that I’ll get to in a minute, is so that they have the rights to them in case the title was leaked for some weird reason, and then someone else would have access to that domain name (www.harrypotterandthehalfbloodprince.com), for movie purposes, and for printing and publishing purposes. So, I went today, onto the UK trademark and patent office website, and I went and looked up all the trademarks under Harry Potter, and they’re all under Warner Brothers, and there’s many on “Harry Potter” – just the phrase “Harry Potter”. And there are a lot of titles that Warner Brothers trademarked back in 2003. And, it’s interesting now because coming back three years later, you’ll see that fifteen of these titles have been – their trademarks were withdrawn. And the reason Warner Brothers trademarked additional names was to throw people off. And if they only did one, such as Half-Blood Prince, then everybody would immediately make that connection that it’s the next title. However, there are three titles that are still registered, and mind you, fifteen of them have been withdrawn since they were patented in 2003. And those titles are: Harry Potter and the Alchemist’s Cell, Harry Potter and the Chariots of Light, and Harry Potter and the Pyramids of Furmat. So, I ask you fellow MuggleCasters, could any of these three titles possibly be the title to Book 7?",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,Greg: I really hope not. Those titles are horrible.,0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Andrew: [laughs] Couldn’t you say that about any of the other titles, before you knew the plot? Like, Chamber of Secrets, doesn’t that sound kind of corny?",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,Greg: It sounds better than The Pyramids of Furmat.,0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,Greg: What the heck does that have to do with anything?,0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Greg: Yeah, but the only alchemist was…",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Greg: Yeah, he was the only alchemist, and it just doesn’t seem likely.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Greg: And I don’t like the title, personally. Personally, I don’t like that.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Andrew: What do you think, Micah?",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Micah: I like the second one. I think if any of them were going to be used, it’d probably be that one.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Andrew: Chariots of Light? Yeah, it’s pretty cool. I mean, the reason that these three are still registered, I would think, is that – well, first of all, you don’t register just one that nobody knows about, yet. Because that’s sort of a dead giveaway. You would register – you would have a few of them patented to throw people off. So, I think it’s very possible and feasible that one of these titles are of Book 7, and if it is true, because we do know that JK Rowling has already settled on a title, then, you can all come back to me and say, “You rule!”",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Greg: I’m afraid people are going to look at this and think, “Oh, Andrew said this, therefore it is correct.”",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Greg: I think people are going to start spreading it around the Internet, “This is the title of the seventh Harry Potter book, oh my god!”",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Andrew: It’s my crackpot theory, and gosh, darn it, I think it has some credibility.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,Ben: Which one? Which title?,0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,Andrew: Any three of them. Any of the three.,0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Andrew: Well, if you don’t like those titles, what if I tell you about some of the other titles that were rejected?",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Ben: Oh, this will be interesting.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,Andrew: You’ll love these. Harry Potter and the Realm of the Lion. Harry Potter and the Serpent’s Prince.,0

1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,Andrew: There’s one called Harry Potter and the Curse of the Dementor.,0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Andrew: I like this one, this one doesn’t make sense: Harry Potter and the Parseltounge Trophy. Could there be some sort of contest? Whomever can speak the best Parseltounge? Harry Potter and the Mudblood Revolt, sounds like Hermione’s going to be…",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Andrew: attacked – yeah. And, Harry Potter and the Battle for Hogwarts. There’s a total of fifteen of them. Mind you, these were all withdrawn, [laughs] so Warner Brothers does not have these trademarked. So, there’s a very small chance that these will actually be used.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Andrew: Now it is time for the big announcement that we promised at the beginning of the show. Ladies and gentlemen, this is going to change the way Harry Potter podcasts are done. I’m so excited, I can’t even say it. Starting next week, with Episode 46, we will be premiering – I hope you’re all sitting down, because you’re all going to pass out – MuggleCast Live.",0

1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Andrew: …every major US city, and we’re going to podcast their, live.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Ben: Okay, what does it really mean? [laughs]",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Andrew: Just kidding, it’s a joke. [laughs] What it really means is…",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Andrew: …at least with next week’s episode, we will be doing live shows over the Internet. Meaning that close to 100 people will be able to listen in as we record the show, live. And you will not only be able to just listen, you will be able to participate, because in replacement of our voicemail segment, we will be taking calls from those who are in our – in our live MuggleCast SkypeCast room. And, even better yet, we will be taking live feedback throughout the entire show. You will be able to write in to us and say what you want to, relating to a topic that we are talking about at that moment. And we will read your feedback live on the air. This is going to change the way we do our discussions because now everyone who is listening will also be involved. And we’re going to go change into a little live show format; we’re still going to have the same great segments that we bring you every week. But ladies and gentlemen, we’re going live.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,Ben: Are we going to do this every week or just this one week?,0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Andrew: Well, I don’t know. [laughs] We’re going to try – I think we should try to do it every week, but we’ve got to see how this one goes and then based on that, maybe we will just do it once a month or every other week or something like that. So, our first live show next week will be Wednesday at 7 PM Eastern. You must have Skype, and there are these new things called SkypeCasts where you can fit up to 100 people in a room, and of course everyone who’s listening in will be muted, but us five will be the only ones talking. And we will have a live feedback system set up so you can send in your feedback as we are doing the show and we’ll read it on the air. So, you can basically drive our conversations just by giving us some good feedback, like a rebuttal, sort of. Full details can be found at MuggleCast.com. Just click on the “LIVE” tab and then we have a page full of great information. We cannot wait to do this, I know I’m really excited. I’m sure Ben and everyone else is too.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Ben: Oh, I am pumped! This’ll be pretty cool.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Andrew: This is – it is. It’s going to be a lot of fun. We’re going to take a break, a quick break about halfway through. It’s – we’re going to…",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,Ben: This is going to be unprecedented in Harry Potter podcasting.,0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Andrew: It is. Yes, it is, and we’re going to – if it goes well, we’ll try to do it every week. I’m sure there’s going to be a week or two where we won’t be able to do it live, but this is going to be a lot of fun. One recommendation that I have for you that will probably not be on the website is you must get in the room quick [laughs] because we’re going to have, I would guess, at least 500 people trying to get into this live room, but we can only fit about 95 people. Eventually, if it’s a big enough success, we’ll – maybe we’ll find a way to broadcast it over a stream so we can have as many people listening as we want, but for now we’re going to have to do it over Skype. And that’s – well, that would also cost a lot of money. So, MuggleCast Live next week, starting at 7 PM Eastern. We’ll record for about a little under two hours, and Jamie will be back. And so will Laura. It’s going to be me, Ben, Laura, Jamie, and then either Micah or Kevin. If Kevin’s still dead, then it’ll definitely be Micah. Micah, are you pumped? Are you ready for this?",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Andrew: [laughs] Let’s go? Okay, let’s do it right now! It’s going to be a lot of fun, so please check out MuggleCast.com for more information.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Andrew: We’ll wrap things up this week with a Chicken Soup for the MuggleCast Soul. This one comes from Melissa, 13, of New York. She writes:",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"“Hey guys, hate the show! Nah, just kidding, I love the show! Anyways, I have a story of myself for your “Chicken Soup” segment, and I didn’t know by what means to submit it. So anyways, here it is. I really adore Harry Potter, but none of my friends enjoy it to the extent that I do. It is very lonely when you feel like you’re in your own little world when it comes to personal interests. At least I had my mom to confide in, who was very welcoming of my attitude towards these books. Unfortunately, she passed away in a car accident in September 2005. I felt more alone than ever. This is when I discovered MuggleNet, and through MuggleNet, I discovered MuggleCast. Just hearing other people like yourselves voice my feelings and thoughts about HP made me feel less alone, and I actually felt bold enough to get a couple of my friends into MuggleCast as well. Thank you MuggleCast, for removing much of my lonely feelings after my mother’s death. I am forever grateful!”",0

1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Well if you mean this symbol it is he symbol of the deathly hollows...
It is related to the story of the 3 brothers. In this story the 3 brothers( The Perevells) came across a deep river at twilight.
As they were trained in magical arts they just waved their wands and created a bridge. As they were crossing the bridge a clocked figure came out...
It was death, and he felt cheated, he acted as he was very pleased and granted all the 3 brothers a wish....
The eldest brother asked for a wand with which no one would be able to defeat him in a duel and death gave him a wand from a nearby tree
The 2nd brother asked for a stone with which the loved ones would come back from dead.
And then death gave the 2nd brother a stone from the river.
And then death turned finally to the youngest and the most intelligent brother,he asked him for an clock with chock death would not be able to follow him, when death gave him his own clock of invisibility.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,AFTER,0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"When the eldest brother was sleeping a man killed the eldest brother and took away his wand so death made the first brother of his own.
When the second brother brought back the love of his life back from death but when she came back it was only the shadow and due to depression  he killed himself and so the death made the second brother of his own.
But
For the youngest brother death searched for years and years but could not find him,after years and years when he grew old he passed on the cloak to his son and then greeted death as an old friend.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Therefore....
The eldest brothers wand is the line between, the circle is the stone of the second stone, where as the third brothers cloak is the triangle",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,This is like reading the whole DH and then asking what the Deathly Hallows are. The triangular symbol is the symbol of the Deathly Hallows.,0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"The triangle stands for the Invisibility Cloak, the circle is the Resurrection Stone, and the straight line in the middle is the Elder Wand. Together, the Deathly Hallows, the triangular symbol as shown above.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,Thank you!,0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Do you mean this symbol? This symbol is the Deathly Hallows. It is a representation of the Elder wand (line), Resurrection stone( and Cloak of Invisibility. Search up Deathly Hallows on Google. There is a story linked to this. Hope this will clarify your doubt.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"The triangle is the invisibility cloak, the straight line in the middle is the Elder Wand and the circle is the resurrection stone.

1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"The Deathly Hallows is composed of three symbols. The vertical line which represents the Elder Wand, the circle, which represents the Resurrection Stone and the equilateral triangle, which represents the Invisibility Cloak. With possession of all three, one has mastery over death.
   However, the vertical line may also represent the number One which represents God. The Circle represents life and the Triangle represents perfect balance. The triangle is also an ancient symbol for male when vertical and when presented upside down... the female.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,The triangle symbol represent the invisible coat which was in Harry Potter possession as handed down from generation to generation of Ignotus the youngest of the Peverel brothers,0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"It symbolizes the Deathly Hallows. The triangle represents the Invisibility Cloak, the circle represents the Resurrection Stone, and the line inside the triangle represents the Elder Wand.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Did you read the book? It was explained… several times. Are you looking to see if maybe there’s a double meaning? Because there isn’t. The book explains the meaning of the triangular symbol pretty well, and at length.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"The symbol you speak of is the symbol for the Deathly Hallows. The symbol is a a triangle that has a line down the center and a circle contained within. The triangle represents the Invisibility Cloak, the line the Elder Wand and the circle the Resurrection Stone. The 3 gifts of death to the Peverell Brothers. The story is a children’s story told to wizarding children, perhaps the way muggles are told Cinderella and Snow White. It is a fairy tale that, perhaps, has some truth to it. Or it’s a fairy tale to explain the 3 magical objects created by 3 very talented brothers. It’s clearly not entirely a fairy tale since Harry eventually ends up with all three objects, becoming the ‘master of death’, which sounds kind of ominous but it’s a mislead. Master of Death sounds like you have figured out how to become immortal, to not die, but what Master of Death in the end means that with the 3 objects he was able to accept death without fear or dread. He stood, waiting for his death without bargaining or begging or being scared of what was to come.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,Powers (as far as I remember) -,0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,Percy Jackson : demigod. Can control water and talk with fish and horses(pegasi included). Trained in combat and awesome with a sword.,0

1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,Both are highly skilled in their own form of fighting. As spectacular as wizarding duels are I have never seen two duelers close to each other. They stand apart and blast each other or fly and blast each other or blast other from above or … well you get the picture. They keep their distance from their opponent (s).,0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Fights in Percy Jackson include, but are not limited to, stabbing and brawling. There is magic but it has a unique way of manifestation and not limited to jets of light shooting out of wands.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,Those fighting styles are universal and it is similar to comparing apples and oranges when we pit them against each other. Harry can curse and jinx from afar but he is in trouble if Percy can get close.,0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,This is excluding the fact that Percy was invulnerable after his dip in river Styx at one point and Harry is immortal if we consider few plausible Harry Potter theories.,0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"But this is exciting and frustrating, pitting two powerful characters from different universes against each other. This is similar to Goku vs Saitama, Goku vs superman or Goku vs Naruto.(Why is it always Goku ?) It is more difficult if you like both the characters very much.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,Say Harry is chasing a dark wizard/ magical creature and finds himself in New York. He chases him into camp half blood. Where he is confronted by Percy.,0

Harry quickly lobs few more curses in Percy’s direction who is hit but the spells bounce off of him. Percy darts forward and strikes but Harry conjures a shield which deflects the blow.,0

1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Harry apparated a short distance away, levitates a few rocks and branches and hurls it at Percy who waves his hand and wave of water from the nearby stream wash away the projectiles.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"This goes on for sometime. Harry throwing curses at Percy who dodges, deflects and tanks them while Harry blocks or disapparates from the sword. Both get tired from the fight.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"And then Katniss Everdeen comes in and breaks up the fight, because why not?",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,I can never reach a satisfying conclusion. The only way this fight will end is if the authors have a little chat and come up with something.,0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"I love both the books and characters and wouldn't want them fighting with each other. But if they were fighting together, that is someting I would read.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Typically, it's a color followed by a number. This case I believe it's “green- 19”. While it varies offense to offense, what that can sometimes signal is one of two “check” plays.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"But let's start at the beginning, say right after the team exits the huddle and they get to the line.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Before they can snap the ball, there are several calls that have to be made. Usually the first call is to set up the protection. You'll sometimes hear Brady or whoever the QB is pointing and yelling out a LB calling them the “the Mike” . For example, might hear them yell“ 52 is Mike, 52 is Mike”. Sometimes this call is made by a lineman, too. This may or may not be the middle LB for the defense, but this is used to set the protection, because each protection call designates a player to have responsibility for the LBs if they rush. By designating the Mike, all responsibilities in the protection can be pointed out with one call.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Next, is where the qb is scanning the defense, checking the personnel looking for the right matchups. This is where he'll decide to snap it or look to get into a better play. Depending on the offense and if they have a “check by me” system, it might go something like this:",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"In the huddle the QB calls two plays, and depending on what he see in the defense when they line up, he will alter his cadence to designate which play. For example, Tony Romo's base cadence is ""WHITE 80, WHITE 80, SET HUT!” Sometimes heard as “ 180 , SET HUT” . A.Rodgers/Brady can be heard yelling “ GREEN 19” , also mistakenly heard as “3-19”.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"In the check with me system, the team would have a ""live color"" for example, green could be live. Then if the QB wants to check to the second play, he doesn't have to use a special alert call. For Romo, he just has to change the cadence to ""GREEN 80 GREEN 80"" which tells the offense they are moving to the second play call. Aaron Rodgers says “BLUE 58”.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Other times, when the qb is completely moving players all around, it could be they're throwing the whole play out audibling into something completely different. This is what you seen regularly from QBs like Peyton Manning and Tony Romo. Only the elite few who have ""full control"" of the offense are able to call any play at the line of scrimmage.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Also what can be heard are dummy calls: In order to keep the defense guessing, QBs will use dummy check or alert calls, in this case he will let his offense know he'll give a dummy call, or he can give a ""Disco"" (disregard the color) call at the line of scrimmage.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"Anyways, this is just a brief look into some of the things going on pre-snap. Lol hope it helped",0

1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"The first question worth asking is, are both allowed to use the weapons they use in their respective game? If so, Lara is known for using pistols. Will that stop Chun-Li? Lara is also known for using a handful of other weapons.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"At range or with weapons allowed, Lara should take this one. Chun Li is one of the fastest fighters around, but she hasn’t shown any ability to dodge bullets. Ironically, Chun-Li is canonically really good with a gun, but we never see her use one.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,"In hand-to-hand combat, Chun-Li should take the victory. Not to say that Lara isn’t skilled in unarmed combat, but she’s not a match for the “Strongest Woman in the World”.",0
1453159400709967880,Angelina Jolie is a horcrux,Lara hands down.,0

His reply was Kimbo would beat Bruce Lee!! ………..I was slightly surprised but not shocked. Naturally, I asked him the obvious, “ Don’t you think the greatest martial artist in history would be too fast , too skillful for Kimbo, have superior technique?” He replied , “Yes, he would be too fast, too skillful & too technical for Kimbo, but when Slice lands one clean punch it’s over- there’s no way that even The Bruce can overcome a 7 stone lean muscle advantage.”",0

Probably 100% more powerful than Slice, much faster , much more skillful & a proper professionally trained heavyweight boxer & one of the best of all time at that. Bruce Lee was the best screen martial artist of all time & I loved his films, but real - life fighting is entirely different to movie fighting. Pound for pound he is probably the toughest guy ever but he cannot afford to give away 6 stone of lean muscle weight advantage to a real life ring monster like peak Tyson. I can honestly say that this is a fight that an intelligent guy like Bruce would never take because he would realize that he is completely outmatched & outgunned. If he weighed 16 stone of solid, lean muscle , with the same skill set then it would be a different story but he didn’t weigh 16 stone- he weighed no more than 10 stone.

Michael Jai White is no slouch. He's a black belt in multiple styles of Martial Arts and definitely is pretty strong. There are however people who have trained Martial Arts for years and competed at the highest levels such as former UFC heavyweight champion Randy Couture. No disrespect to MJW, but I have no doubt that Couture could throw White on his head in seconds.
