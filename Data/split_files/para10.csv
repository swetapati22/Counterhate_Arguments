It really pissed me off when he started listening to nothing but Dead bootlegs. We were living in Ypsilanti MI, close to Ann Arbor. He wanted to go to Alpne Valley in Wisconsin to see them. It was July 7, 1984. By then, I was convinced I hated Jerry and the boys and all they stood for, but as I dug road trips and hippy chicks, I said I’d go. Grateful Dead live shows were truly remarkable. It started with the carnival like atmosphere in the parking lot. It was a mini bazaar with people seling anything they could, to make money to follow the band. The Dead allowed unlicensed merchandise to be sold. People were selling hand crafted t-shirts, bumper stickers, posters, drug paraphernalia, water, food, drugs, and bootleg tapes. It was a huge party with Dead music playing everywhere. I was starting not to mind that so much.",0

1300173590554464256,This mayer is a complete vile idiot.,"There are many good reasons to hate the Grateful Dead. The biggest one is their lack of quality control. The Dead had an extraordinarily long career, beset by interpersonal conflict, drug abuse, and simple burnout. It was inevitable that they wouldn’t always be at the top of their game. So while their high points are very high, those peaks are surrounded by wide plains of mediocrity and some deep valleys of terribleness.",0
1300173590554464256,This mayer is a complete vile idiot.,"One of the deepest valleys is the one occupied by the Dead’s singing. They were untrained vocalists, and while their raggedness could be charming at times, they clearly didn’t try very hard to keep things in tune. The band did work with Crosby, Stills and Nash on the harmonies for American Beauty, and it showed. But in general, singing well wasn’t a priority, and that showed too.",0
1300173590554464256,This mayer is a complete vile idiot.,"Another challenge facing would-be Dead listeners is the band’s extreme stylistic eclecticism. That made for a lively and unpredictable sound, but while their range attracts a variety of people, it inevitably also alienates a variety of people too. The Dead combined straightahead hippie rock with country, blues, R&B, bluegrass, funk, disco, reggae, prog, middle of the road pop, modal jazz, free jazz, abstract electronica, and more. Few people like all of those things. I mean, Phil Lesh was studying atonal composition with Luciano Berio while Jerry Garcia was picking banjo in bluegrass bands; the Venn diagram overlap between those two styles is not large. The Dead’s biggest hit, “Touch of Grey”, brought in lots of new listeners, but the hardcore fans despised it, because they signed up for acid-fueled freakouts, not radio-friendly dad rock. And the Dead weren’t equally adept at every style they tried. If you’re deeply into prog or jazz or bluegrass, you’re not likely to be impressed by the Dead’s dabbling.",0
1300173590554464256,This mayer is a complete vile idiot.,"OK, let me put it out upfront that the Dead are my favorite band in many ways. Much of the reasons why people hate the Dead have been described in previous answers from an aversion of hippie values, to playing long extended jams that seem pointless to some people. All of this is true, so I would like to add a few more reasons why some people hate their music.",0
1300173590554464256,This mayer is a complete vile idiot.,"(1) The Dead were around for a long time (let’s say from 1965 - 1995 approximately). In my view (btw I am 62 years old and went to my first Dead concert in 1970), their peak and almost all of their really good music and performances were between 1968 - 1978. Many younger music lovers never heard the Dead play with energy and verve. This may have largely been due to Garcia’s drug problem, but they developed a kind of scelerotic, languid pace as they got older. Or to put it more bluntly, as they got older , the music began to suck (IMO) in comparision to their magnificent early years.",0
1300173590554464256,This mayer is a complete vile idiot.,"(2) To some people, the Dead don’t sound like conventional rock music, but I am not referring to 20 minute jams versus 3 miinute songs. Excuse my political incorrectness here , I am just trying to be descriptive, but the Dead are the “whitest” sounding band to make an impact. Most rock music is obviously based on genres like blues and rhythm & blues. I don’t think the Dead really absorbed these genres compared to their peers, especially after PigPen died. Compare their versions of something like “It’s All Over Now” to say, Rod Stewart’s or the Rolling Stones. The Dead were largely influenced by musical forms that originated in the Appalachians from Scottish and Irish settlers like folk, bluegrass, etc. Their music in many ways started (although it evolved) as electrified folk. “Casy Jones”, for example, is really electric jug band music. Some people just don’t think this is what Rock music should be. Music like this (e.g. The Dead and the Band) are now part of what is called “Americana” which has an audience more attuned to coutnry music than rock.",0

And I particularly hate a lot of the “tapers”, extremely self-entitled arrogant inept morons. Not type-casting an entire group, but there is a lot of it, and it’s BAD. The impact of the Grateful Dead on society was/is a double-edged sword. As I said though, I love the music. They were good musicians, but terrible in the studio, and terrible with business/professionalism. They got some help from Stephen Stills and recorded some of their best material in the early 70’s.

1300173590554464256,This mayer is a complete vile idiot.,"I have worked as a recording and live music mixer/engineer and have been a professional musician for over 46 years. As a consequence, I have worked with and have met as well as have been “friends” with quite a few famous musicians. I have to say that after so many years in the business that I have met so many famous musicians and actors that I just don’t care who they are and I don’t put up with star trips. This comes from years of being told not to look people in the eye and not to address people, but at the same time I have had to step up and keep them from looking like idiots on stage more times than I can count. I once mixed touring major label bands for a big coast to coast, live radio broadcast. After a short while I got tired of waiting to get paid by the record labels and tired of the bands being controlling bullies. A veteran of the business taught me the trick to gaining control and that was to INSIST on being paid in full before the artist or band even showed up. My rule was to be paid 50% for booking my time and the remaining 50% before the broadcast went live. The record labels then always paid me per my terms. I laid down strict rules and one was the door to the recording truck where I was mixing was off limits to anyone until I personally allowed them access. When you entered the recording truck you entered my world which only I controlled. I also had the artist’s record label sign letter/contract that stated that I was the only person who would mix the show. When the artist threw up any road blocks or caused trouble my line was always, “You can demand whatever you want, but if you cause trouble the network will refuse to air the show. You will have to answer to your label because I am already paid and the money is in my bank account.” The network (ABC) backed me 100% on this, too. I still had bands throw mini fits, but most were for show. Once I had the control it was amazing how many artists came to me and made excuses about THEIR performance after the show.",0

He was EXTREMELY condescending towards me and made all kinds of amateur demands. I just humored him and undid everything he made me do. He made a few idiot requests that I simply refused to do. He knew that I was much more experience than he was, so it was fairly easy for me to re-direct his silly suggestions. He was completely clueless about mixing drums yet he had to put on some sort of a show in front of a bunch of professionals. He basically looked like a clown and after he and his FOH mixer guy left the truck we all laughed at him. I was nice to his face, but he left the recording truck defeated.",0

Rappers do this because of the profit motive. People are willing to have short memories with what Chris Brown did because hey we will make lots of money, who cares if were promoting an abusive womanizer, its selling albums. Its the core problem with the monetary system, many ways to make incredible amounts of money is removed from any sense of morality or justice. Yet, the fans seem to a short memory too because his last album sold like crazy.
But, generally, I think artists should be judged by their music and their moral character is an entirely different question all together. Do I think Kanye showed how much of cocky idiot he is when he interrupted Taylor Swift at the MTV Music Awards, absolutely. Is my evidence that Kanye is a jerk going to stop me from spittin Otis, heak no. At its core music should be judged by its sounds and lyrics and not on the moral fiber of the one producing that music. So as long as Chris Brown looks nice, dances well, and sings decently he will continue to sell albums and have artists wanting to work with him. Dont be so naive as to act like if Chris Brown offered a collaboration you wouldnt do it. You would be a fool not to, its a huge opportunity in a music career regardless of what he does behind closed doors.",0

2. Singing ability and musical talent…
3. Tunes are catchy and appealing, he does attempt to write them himself and this is another reason to note;
4. Good collaborative work with notable artists. I always enjoy a stand out artist that collaborates with others. It shows he shares his limelight and successful collaborations always gain excellent critical attention;
5. He’s hot!!!! So hot!! And it isn't only about presentation…the looks themselves are fine, but, any man that dances and sings and holds court the way CB manages to do makes his level of sexy just that little bit hotter…SOOOO Fine :)

When people are drinking, they get mouthy. She pushed me, and I got her down on the floor. Security came, and because I was on top, they threw me out.”",0
1262186756037849088,Avril lavigne is a evil whore.,"Lavigne’s management has warned her that if she gets arrested and deported from the U.S., it might be fatal to her career, which is off to a fast start with the single “Complicated.”",0
1262186756037849088,Avril lavigne is a evil whore.,"Lavigne grew up in Napanee, Ontario, population 5,000. (The name is French and is pronounced AH-vreel la-VEEN.) Her father worked for the phone company; her mom stayed home. All her life, she dreamed of being a pop star. Not only would she sing in front of the mirror, she’d pretend she was being interviewed.",0
1262186756037849088,Avril lavigne is a evil whore.,"Singing gospel in church turned into performing country songs by Faith Hill and the Dixie Chicks at county fairs and talent contests. At age twelve, she borrowed her father’s guitar and taught herself to play by practicing Lenny Kravitz’s “Fly Away” over and over. Her favorite bands were the Goo Goo Dolls, Matchbox Twenty and especially Hanson. “Check out the lead singer! He’s adorable!” she enthuses. Then she reflects, “The funny thing is, we kind of look alike.”",0
1262186756037849088,Avril lavigne is a evil whore.,"Lavigne’s first kiss came in ninth grade; when her parents were away one night, a boy snuck over to her house. She just wanted to get it done, she says: “It sucked, because I didn’t know what I was doing – and I couldn’t even blame it on alcohol.”",0
1262186756037849088,Avril lavigne is a evil whore.,"Lavigne signed a demo deal with the Canadian label Nettwerk; they sent her down to New York to work with producer Peter Zizzo when she was sixteen. Outside the window of her West Village apartment, she could see transvestites and hookers. While she was waiting for a cab one evening, a man flashed his bankroll and asked, “You working tonight?” After that, she started carrying a knife. When Arista head Antonio “L.A.” Reid came to the studio to see her, all her collaborators kept telling her not to be nervous. She didn’t understand why, because, she says, she’d never had stage fright in her life.",0
1262186756037849088,Avril lavigne is a evil whore.,"“Girlfriend,” the lead single from Avril Lavigne’s new album, is a song that speaks entirely in the imperative, with a lyric sheet full of exclamation points and music to match: shout-along vocals, power chords, hand claps amplified to sound like an army on the march. The song seems custom-built to bully the world’s radio programmers into submission, but Lavigne took no chances, recording the chorus in seven languages. Do a little fancy Googling, and you can hear Lavigne bellow the phrase “Hey! Hey! You! You!/ I don’t like your girlfriend!/ No way! No way!/ I think you need a new one” in Mandarin. The song is a smash, a top-10 hit in 14 countries, including the United States, where it was her first Billboard No. 1. As for the album, The Best Damn Thing, it’s been No. 1 for two consecutive weeks, and, impressively, nearly all of its songs are as big and brash and catchy as “Girlfriend.”",0
1262186756037849088,Avril lavigne is a evil whore.,"Lavigne’s latest success is a reminder that she’s one of the most influential pop singers of the decade. We first met her in 2002, when she rolled into view atop a battered skateboard in the video for her debut single, “Complicated.” She was the female answer to all those mall-rat punk-pop bands—proof that a 17-year-old girl could whine and snarl just like the boys and look just as silly in a pair of pants five sizes too big. But her main innovation was sonic, forsaking traditional girly teenpop (syrupy ballads, dance beats) for huge choruses that crested over loud guitars. Almost immediately, the style became de rigueur, with everyone from Ashlee Simpson to Hilary Duff to Kelly Clarkson deploying distortion pedals and black mascara. Even Liz Phair fell under Avril’s sway, ditching shaggy indie rock to work with Lavigne’s producers, the Matrix.",0
1262186756037849088,Avril lavigne is a evil whore.,"Phair got a lot of grief for “going Avril,” but it actually made a kind of sense, for Avril was already meeting Phair halfway. A defining feature of post-Lavigne teenpop is its adult pretensions: The drift from pop into rock signals both attitude and “seriousness,” and the songs, accordingly, are full of psychobabble such as, “You fall and you crawl and you break and you take what you get and you turn it into honesty“—a teenager’s version of mature relationship talk. Lavigne’s second album, Under My Skin (2004), went further, dispensing with the sprightly punk-pop for midtempo songs about romantic disillusionment. While indie rockers are busy fetishizing teenybopper music old and new, today’s real live teenagers are spending most of their time, as kids will, trying to sound like grown-ups.",0
1262186756037849088,Avril lavigne is a evil whore.,"Which makes The Best Damn Thing something of a shift. The album is gleefully, raucously, broadly bubblegum—a high-school musical delivered with a big wink. The album opens with the thumping pep-rally beat of “Girlfriend,” a sound that recurs throughout. The title track’s refrain finds Avril spelling out her own name cheer-style. (“Give me an A/ Always give me what I want/ Give me a V/ Be very, very good to me.”) Now 22, Lavigne is old enough to play the same game as indie rockers, gazing back at teenpop—and teenagerdom—with affection and amusement, while throwing up the big musical scare quotes of cheerleader chants and breakneck punk-pop tempos.",0
1262186756037849088,Avril lavigne is a evil whore.,"For the first couple of listens, it’s hard not to get swept up in all the fun and in the album’s lean, lithe sound. (Lavigne’s collaborators include studio savant Dr. Luke, one of the mad scientists behind Kelly Clarkson’s stupendous “Since U Been Gone.”) But if you spend a little extra time with The Best Damn Thing, it begins to take on a more sinister cast. The charm of Lavigne’s early hits was the conviction with which she played the underdog: the tomboyish punkette who was deep enough to see the beauty in the “sk8er boi” spurned by the status-conscious popular girl. But on the new album, Avril appears to have become the thing she loathed, barking slogans of prissy entitlement: “I wear the pants/ I’m the one who tells you what to do”; “Don’t you question me/ You just do what I say”; “Me, I’m a scene, I’m a drama queen/ I’m the best damn thing that your eyes have ever seen”; and, in “Girlfriend,” “I think you know I’m damn precious/ And hell yeah, I’m the motherfuckin’ princess,” a line that suggests there may be more to the whole cheerleader routine than a cheeky nod to Toni Basil. Has Avril, as critic Carl Wilson wondered in a recent blog post, become a “Heather”?",0
1262186756037849088,Avril lavigne is a evil whore.,"Judging by the “Girlfriend” video, the answer is yes. In the clip, two Avrils—one a bad-ass rocker chick, the other a preppy redhead with librarian’s glasses—square off in a battle for the affections of a dreamy guy. The clothes make it clear whom we’re supposed to root for, but the plot complicates things. Our black-clad heroine is a horrible little tyrant who subjects the preppy to all sorts of torments before driving a golf ball into her head at a mini-golf course and leaping triumphantly into a Port-a-Potty with the boy. I may be too many decades removed from high school to really get this revenge fantasy, but the idea that we’re supposed to cheer a revolution in which the ruling elite is replaced by creeps who enforce their will with golf-ball beanings seems like a perversion of the punk ideal. Avril’s rock ’n’ roll high school seems a lot like every other godawful high school, only its evil alpha girls have jet-black hair and wear Ramones T-shirts.",0
1262186756037849088,Avril lavigne is a evil whore.,"That golf-ball attack underscores what may be the most troubling aspect of The Best Damn Thing: Lavigne has girl issues. She’s always been full of unkind words for ne’er-do-well guys, but on the new album, she pours scorn on women. “Girlfriend” is mild compared to “One of Those Girls,” a portrait of a gold digger that Snoop Dogg would love. (“She’s one of those girls/ They’re nothing but trouble. … She’ll take you for a ride and you’ll be left with nothing/ You’ll be broke and she’ll be gone/ Off to the next one.”) Then there’s the galloping “Everything Back but You,” a breakup song that climaxes with the cry of “bitch, slut, psychopath.” There’s already plenty of casually misogynist emo-rock boys spouting that kind of rhetoric—why is Avril Lavigne joining in the chorus when she could be kicking their asses? Heather, heal thyself.",0
1262186756037849088,Avril lavigne is a evil whore.,"Pop stars – especially women – are frozen at the age they become famous. Breaking the ice usually involves a bad-girl reinvention, if not a genuine breakdown. Somehow, this tension never affected Avril Lavigne, the Canadian pop-punk star who arrived in 2002 aged 17 with the brilliant Complicated, a heaving teenage sigh directed at some poseur boy. It’s not that she didn’t have an indelible look: her low-slung skate pants, tie and ramrod-straight hair are an enduring fancy-dress costume. It’s that she never seemed to want to grow up.",0
1262186756037849088,Avril lavigne is a evil whore.,"Her alternately fun, angsty debut album, Let Go, seemed authentic enough – she played guitar! The lyrics were handwritten! – to convince a generation of teenage girls that she, and by association, they, were more credible than Britney. Then 13, I was one of them; I wore Dad’s tie to the shops and wasted hours learning how to copy her handwriting. It was music many quickly graduated from, to acts whose credits didn’t list multiple co-writers: the drug of authenticity hooks teenagers fast. But there is no shame in being a gateway artist, a role Lavigne seemed surprisingly happy to keep playing.",0
1262186756037849088,Avril lavigne is a evil whore.,"After an emotionally intense second album, she seemed to dial back the years with 2007’s The Best Damn Thing, led by single Girlfriend, a Hey Mickey-style rager about homewrecking. Goodbye Lullaby (2011) had What the Hell (“All I want is to mess around”) and her 2013 self-titled album boasted Bitchin’ Summer (ie School’s Out with swearing) and Here’s to Never Growing Up (“We’ll be running down the street, yelling, ‘Kiss my ass’”). She was 29. A year later, she started feeling inexplicably exhausted. Doctors tried to diagnose her with anxiety and chronic fatigue, even though she was sure she had Lyme disease. Finally, she got a vindicating diagnosis and spent two years in bed on antibiotics, certain, at one point, that she would die.",0
1262186756037849088,Avril lavigne is a evil whore.,"What happens when a teenage immortal faces death? Lavigne, now 34, doesn’t want to talk about that. “It was a relief” to get the diagnosis, she says tersely, calling from Los Angeles. “I was like: ‘OK, now I can at least start treating something.’” She was treated at home. Who cared for her? Her manager interrupts and insists we “really focus on the music”. But it is hard to separate Lavigne’s illness from her sixth album, Head Above Water, named after a song that came to her as she lay in her mother’s arms, feeling as if she was drowning. It is her best song in years, an emphatic, gothic ballad that is doing well on the US Christian singles chart and has 57m YouTube views. “It just felt really good to be singing,” she says. “The emotion was so raw.”",0
1262186756037849088,Avril lavigne is a evil whore.,"Despite Lavigne’s illness, she says she never doubted her capacity to commit to a whole album. She started writing on guitar in bed, graduating to piano when she felt stronger. Inner strength is the prevailing theme of the eight songs I heard, which often evoke Lana Del Rey’s moody epics. Empowerment anthems like this were everywhere a few years ago, but have been replaced by stark admissions of vulnerability and nihilism. But keeping pace with pop wasn’t Lavigne’s concern. “I didn’t want to do what everyone was doing,” she says, mentioning a need for “organic musical realness” and constructing songs around her vocals “versus building this crazy loud track and just burying a vocal in it”. This is the kind of dry “focus on the music” Lavigne prefers. She keeps saying how “meaningful” the music is, but won’t go deeper.",0
1262186756037849088,Avril lavigne is a evil whore.,"Other songs allude to a toxic relationship. All Lavigne will say is that my assumption is “obviously” correct and that they’re categorically not about her second ex-husband, Nickelback frontman Chad Kroeger; they have a “great relationship” (he worked on the album). “I appreciate you trying to really get the juice,” she says mockingly, “but I’m not gonna go there.” I explain that I’m not looking for gossip, but context for her most personal album. “That’s the thing about my music,” she says, exasperated. “I write it and I put it out there, and people can interpret it the way they like.” It is hard to talk about the music when the music apparently speaks for itself.",0
1262186756037849088,Avril lavigne is a evil whore.,"But maybe never showing vulnerability is key to Lavigne’s 17-year pop career. She has heartfelt songs – her debut album’s I’m With You is a fantastic pop-rock ballad, later sampled by Rihanna – but her exterior has swung between feckless (giving the finger on MTV’s era-defining Total Request Live in 2004) and brittle. (She regrets the tearful 2015 television interview announcing her illness.) She is publicly close to both her ex-husbands, Kroeger and Sum 41 frontman Deryck Whibley, whom she met aged 17, married at 21 and divorced at 25.",0
1262186756037849088,Avril lavigne is a evil whore.,"Pop is built on female resilience, which seems to have come naturally to her. When asked whether sexist and derisory criticism affected her as a teenager, she is unimpressed: “I don’t know what you’re referring to.” The stories she told about Limp Bizkit’s Fred Durst trying to sleep with her; the manufactured feud between her and Britney Spears? “Oh, that’s OK,” she says, flippantly. “It’s just because I was superpowerful and they needed gossip to talk about.” Her debut sold more than 6m copies in a year and she toured the world. Did she always feel protected as a teenage girl in a cutthroat industry? “It was a whirlwind, and it was so magical and unbelievable.” The only gruelling parts were the “different time zones and travelling”.",0
1262186756037849088,Avril lavigne is a evil whore.,"What seemed less natural as her career progressed was Lavigne’s actual identity. The driven 15-year-old from smalltown Napanee, Ontario, was discovered singing country songs in a bookshop. A year later, she moved to New York with her older brother after a Canadian label sent footage of her singing karaoke to a producer. Two months after turning 17, she was signed by pop impresario LA Reid. In Lavigne’s telling, Arista thought they had a Sheryl Crow-style country act on their hands, but she wanted to write heavier songs. A compromise was reached: after writing rockier material with one co-writer, she was paired with LA trio the Matrix, who wrote Let Go’s three massive singles, Complicated, Sk8er Boi and I’m With You. Lavigne and Matrix disagree about the level of her input on the album. Reid maintained “whatever gets the job done” diplomacy.",0
1262186756037849088,Avril lavigne is a evil whore.,"The first album was so successful that Lavigne says she only had six months to write 2004’s Under My Skin: “They made me put it out before I was ready.” She and co-writer Butch Walker kept writing until the last minute, producing the bittersweet grunge anthem My Happy Ending. “I called them and I said: ‘Guys, I have the first single.’ They’re like: ‘No, we’re going with Don’t Tell Me.’” Arista led with their choice but Lavigne was right: My Happy Ending peaked higher and sold almost three times as many copies.",0
1262186756037849088,Avril lavigne is a evil whore.,"The brooding Under My Skin reflected the kind of progression that makes sense, especially for a pop star who stressed her autonomy at a time when girls weren’t afforded much of it. Which is why her third album, The Best Damn Thing, seemed so odd. Her first for a new label, RCA, it was a riotous pop record led by the deadpan cheerleader banger Girlfriend, her only US No 1 single to date.",0
1262186756037849088,Avril lavigne is a evil whore.,"Like Gwen Stefani, Lavigne has always been conservative despite her punk image. Her family are devoutly Christian. She once described girls “having sex with a ton of boys” as “a bad thing”, a belief that informed Don’t Tell Me: “Did I not tell you that I’m not like that girl, the one who gives it all away?” By the time she released The Best Damn Thing, the Disney-pushed purity-ring craze dominated pop. But even that couldn’t explain the album’s regressive lyrics: “You left without me and now you’re somewhere out there with a bitch, slut, psycho babe,” she sang on Everything Back But You. On the title track, she moaned about how she hated it when a guy “doesn’t get the door”, “doesn’t get the tab”, “doesn’t understand why a certain time of the month I don’t wanna hold his hand”.",0
1262186756037849088,Avril lavigne is a evil whore.,"In retrospect, it would be a relief to blame the album on its producer and co-writer, Dr Luke, who made his name creating debauched hits for the era’s female icons, and lost favour after former protegee Kesha accused him of abuse. (He denies all claims and is suing for defamation.) But Lavigne enjoyed working with him: “We wrote really great songs together.” These three albums were the only records – until now – where she didn’t have to compromise. “It was the fourth album when the tears started,” she says.",0
1262186756037849088,Avril lavigne is a evil whore.,"“The majority of the time in my career, [RCA] want me to write another Girlfriend. They don’t want the ballads.” It seems especially tragic that on 2011’s otherwise lovelorn Goodbye Lullaby – written following her split from Whibley, although he produced half of it – she had to include What the Hell, a song about snogging a guy’s friends and going “on a million dates” that sounded unfortunately similar to the then ubiquitous Disney pop-rock she had inspired.",0
1262186756037849088,Avril lavigne is a evil whore.,"“It’s difficult to be a woman and to be heard, and people sometimes don’t take you seriously,” she says, finally warming to a subject. “I’m highly intuitive and I’ve always got a very strong gut feeling. I’ve always felt that I’ve known what’s best for me to do and I’ve had to fight different people on this journey over those 17 years: ‘You need to do this and it needs to go Top 40.’ You make those songs cos you have to, but then the stuff that’s the best on record is the album tracks.”",0
1262186756037849088,Avril lavigne is a evil whore.,"It sounds miserable. “I would get some songs the style I really wanted,” she says. “I always loved the pop-rock thing and it’s still who I am. I’m still proud of those songs and I wrote them. It wasn’t like people wrote them and gave it to me. It was like: ‘OK, I get it. You guys want singles that are going in this direction. Fine, I’ll work with you but I’d rather be doing something else.’ You can’t be stubborn and just do everything your own way.”",0
1262186756037849088,Avril lavigne is a evil whore.,"If commercially inclined compromise is one of the secrets of Lavigne’s enduring career, it remains at odds with the delinquent attitude of many of her songs. That was the mood on her 2013 self-titled album, which dwelled on teenage rebellion and contained a J-pop-influenced song about Hello Kitty that many deemed racist on seeing its stereotype-laden video. (She denied the suggestion, citing the Japanese production crew.) Claims of cultural appropriation aside, its lyrics fared little better. Referencing Spin the Bottle and “roll[ing] around in our underwear”, it sounded like a middle-aged pervert’s idea of teenage sleepovers.",0
1262186756037849088,Avril lavigne is a evil whore.,"“The label didn’t tell me what to write, lyrically,” she insists. “I’m young at heart. I’m a free spirit. I’m super-fun. I love to hang out and have fun and dance and skateboard.” She reels off the diverse types of song she can write “in my sleep”: about love, breakups, partying, dancing, rock’n’roll, friendship. “I’m a fucking rock star, bitch!”",0
1262186756037849088,Avril lavigne is a evil whore.,"Perhaps it’s a sign of how effectively Arista marketed Lavigne’s debut that you want to believe there was a frustrated artist in there all along. Two years ago, a conspiracy theory that Lavigne had died and been replaced by a doppelganger went viral. It was absurd, and must have been extremely hurtful for Lavigne to witness people laughing about her hypothetical death when her health was so precarious. Beyond the delight of a well-reasoned crackpot theory, I don’t think people were gloating about her demise, but attempting to make sense of her jarring career: surely these artists weren’t the same person?",0

We were the same age with similar tastes in music, similar viewpoints on life, and similar, sarcastic senses of humor. We were both trying to make it in music and grow a fan base. We confided in each other. We trusted each other. We had an ongoing, supportive relationship that helped both of us when we sometimes felt there was nowhere else to turn. Few knew of my coversations with her - but some of Taylor’s closest friends did know they were taking place (they called me “the guy on MySpace,” as it is my understanding Taylor did not tell them my name).",0

We would write messages to one another that, if printed, would be multiple pages long. Looking back, these were the messages of two teenagers trying to find themselves and, in the process, found a friend in one another. We never had expectations, just a supportive friendship with a member of the opposite sex we could not seem to find offline.

I thought that my burdens would weigh Taylor down. So, rather than turn to Taylor for support or tell her what happened, I did the only thing sixteen year old me knew how to do… I closed myself off, shut down my MySpace page… and tried to grapple with the experience on my own. To this day, I feel guilty about having left her out in the dark. But I still believe I did the right thing. Taylor had a dream we both shared and it was becoming a reality. I was not about to stand in the way by making her worry about her friend. She was too kind and sweet to me. Strapping her with that type of burden would have been unjustifiable.

8259236731,"Avril Lavigne is stupid, she needs a punch in the face.","Awww, well, I don't think ""My Happy Ending"" as a choice for a single wasn't a bad once...Maybe her and her peeps were just going for the obvious hits or radio potential track and stuff. Honestly, there are better tracks on ""Under My Skin,"" but ""My Happy Ending"" ain't crap whatsoever. I would love to see a track like ""Forgotten"" to be released, but people would never take her that seriously though. I think now it's risky for an artist like her to release a downright serious single because that'll just be reciprocated with ridicule or something. It's a pretty sad thing for young artists who truly are artists. Avril's still got more potential though, I feel, as is with other young artists. I mean ""Under In Skin"" is probably her best effort now, but it's always good to look forward for better. I like the album though.",0
8259236731,"Avril Lavigne is stupid, she needs a punch in the face.","Hey Everyone!How's it going?? So... I just wanted to fill you guys in...I'm done with my 4th record!!! Well, actually I have been done for a year... and now my record company have finally decided to release it. OMG..How nice! Thanks guys.I have been dying to get back out on the road and do what I love the most... PLAY MUSIC. I know you guys have been waiting for a long time.....and so have I, but not by choice. I have been sitting with this record for a year now. It's really special to me. I have produced a couple tracks alone for the first time, written solo, with friends, I have pushed myself and I feel proud.In saying all that, this has been a really difficult record for me to create and to release. Not only is this the most meaningful and special record I have written, it is sincere, honest and close to my heart. But for the first time I experienced a bunch of bureaucratic BS. People do their best work when they are doing what they want, love and is natural for them, not when you are forcing them to be something that they are not.From the beginning of my career my message has always been to be yourself and stand up for what you believe in. Follow your heart.My first single off this record is called: ""What The Hell"". This song is the least personal song to me off this album. It's a fun and funny anthem. It has a broad message about personal freedom. It is the most pop track on the record.I am shooting the video in 2 weeks and it will be out in January. I have been extremely busy designing Abbey Dawn and taking the line internationally for the first time, establishing ""The Avril Lavigne Foundation"" and focusing on my personal happiness and health. Balance!Love you guys!xo Avril",0
8259236731,"Avril Lavigne is stupid, she needs a punch in the face.","Avril Lavigne didnt mean to start recording a new album. It just happened, she says of the. I made a record without even feeling like I made a record.Sitting in a studio in Tarzana, Calif., with her feet  clad in a pair of vinyl hightops  propped up on a mixing board, the now 24 year old pop-punk princess barely looks a day older than she did when Complicated took the airwaves by storm in 2002. Im sitting on the piano writing in the foyer, and hes in the studio, and its like, Hey. I like that.He is Lavignes husband (and Sum 41 frontman) Deryck Whibley, who has used the couples home studio to produce eight of the nine tracks shes recorded so far. I think this is taking the spirit of what shes done on previous records so much further, he says. Its way more meaningful, has more of an impact, more emotional. It makes me feel something more than the other stuff. And I wanted to match that musically with the track.Lavigne seems thrilled to have such a crack in-house production partner. He knows me. We spend a lot of time together, she laughs, in her habitual cackle. And the cool thing is, if hes recording something and I dont like it, I can be like, No, no, no, I dont like that. More like this. Or I can walk in and be like, Love it. Keep going.It was a song snippet called Black Star  intended for her fragrance commercial  that launched the recording process back in November; Lavigne played that intro and two complete tracks for EW called Everybody Hurts and Darlin. The first has a trademark Lavigne acoustic beginning, then explodes into a loud chorus of Everybody hurts some days.The second is a love song Lavigne wrote when she was 15: I always really liked this song, she says, and I never recorded it. There are other songs from her past on the record, too, including one she wrote at 17, and one she wrote at 20. I always had material, but some people that I worked with didnt really care, because they wanted to write the stuff, she says, when asked why the tunes havent surfaced before. Some people were just like, Ah, whatever. Youre a little girl. What do you know? I know how this works. Its my fourth record. Its not rocket science. I think people doubted me before, and Im finally just like, Im doing this.Both new tracks also demonstrate quite clearly that the rapping/Toni Basil affliction that plagued 2007s The Best Damn Thing has left her system, and shes back to the emo-heavy strengths of her first two albums. [Best Damn Thing] was intended to be fun, to be rockin, she explains. All I had in my mind was my live show, running around on stage, getting the crowd involved. This record, I just really, really wanted to sing. We started recording each song, some of them, just with acoustic guitar and the vocal and building it from there. Its stripped down. I love performing that way, so I really felt like it was time to make a record like that. To just make it all about the vocal and the performance, and the vibe, and the emotion.Shes thinking about doing a theater tour in support of the new album, so she can bring that emotion directly to the audience. I just wanna have silence around me, and have these acoustic songs and really deliver, she says.Theres more work to be done before the album release, but Lavigne doesnt seem to be sweating it. My new word right now is balance, she says. Work hard, play hard. Maybe that should be the album cover: Work Hard, Play Hard Bitch. With this, she cracks herself up again. I swear to God I have not drank anything but green juice today, she grins. Why am I acting like this? Part of it may be that the little sk8er girl is finally growing up, and feels comfortable  and demonstrably happy  making an album that reflects where she is in life right now. I was always really honest in my lyrics, she says, I think more so when I was younger, and now its kind of come back to that. Just like, you know what? Im not trying to write a perfect pop song. Im just trying to write a song thats honest right now, even if something sounds weird or a lyric might not make sense to someone.Im turning 25 this year. 25, but not 35! Half of me is really older-acting and the other half is a young spirit. When Im really old, I think Ill be crazy, and have a young spirit and be fun. But yeah. I am an adult. But sometimes I still feel like Im 19. She guffaws again. Sometimes I still dress like Im 19. I dont think Ill ever be super mad sophisticated. I think Ill always be like this.",0
