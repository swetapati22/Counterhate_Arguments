I’m scaredFace with open mouth and cold sweat,"If conspiracy theories are as old as politics, they’re also — in the era of Donald Trump and QAnon — as current as the latest headlines. Earlier this month, the American democracy born of an eighteenth century conspiracy theory faced its most severe threat yet — from another conspiracy theory, that (all evidence to the contrary) the 2020 presidential election was rigged. Are conspiracy theories truly more prevalent and influential today, or does it just seem that way?",0

Others focused on domestic political conspiracies, such as President Harry Truman covering up Communist infiltration of the government in the 1950s, and the idea that the 9/11 attacks were coordinated by the US to smear the Saudis.

More recent polling research by Uscinski suggests that this overall picture has remained the same — with belief in specific conspiracy theories rising and falling over time, but no evidence for an overall increase. “The general hypothesis that’s put out there in the media is [that] everyone’s becoming conspiracists, and now is the golden age of conspiracy theory,” Uscinski says. “We find no such thing whatsoever.”",0

Democrats tend to be suspicious of corporations and conservatives. Republicans are more likely to be suspicious of communists and liberals.

It’s not easy for one of the most powerful people in the world to claim they’re the victim of a conspiracy (it didn’t work, for instance, when allies of Bill Clinton blamed a “vast right-wing conspiracy” for the president’s troubles during his impeachment trial in the late 1990s). Trump, however, cast himself as a political outsider from the beginning, Uscinski says: “He sets himself up, not only as a victim of the other side, but of both parties and the entire system and what he calls the deep state…so everything is rigged against him.” The Russia inquiry and his 2019 impeachment, Uscinski adds, helped to feed this narrative, which has continued through the chaotic aftermath of the 2020 election.",0

Trump’s baseless tweets that the election was rigged, she says, stand in contrast to Kennedy assassination conspiracists obsessing over bullet trajectories or 9/11 conspiracists diving into data on the temperature at which jet fuel burns. “This conspiracy thinking that’s going on today takes a very different and novel and dangerous form,” she says, because it seeks to delegitimize political rivals, government agencies, the press and others who might stand in the way. “It unsettles the ground on which we argue, negotiate, and even disagree,” she and coauthor Russell Muirhead wrote in their 2019 book, A Lot of People Are Saying: The New Conspiracism and the Assault on Democracy. “It makes democracy unworkable — and ultimately, it makes democracy seem unworthy.”",0

Because any individual can know only a tiny sliver of the world firsthand, we have no choice but to accept a great deal of information we can’t verify for ourselves.

In experiments where volunteers read about conspiracy theories before answering questionnaires about their likelihood to engage in various behaviors, Douglas and others have found evidence that conspiracy theories reduce people’s inclination to vote, to vaccinate their children, or to help fight climate change.

Qanon really says very little directly; most of the ‘crumbs’ are lists of odd questions with the implication that if you puzzle out the answers you will learn hidden truths about the greatness of Donald Trump, the missing Clinton emails, the power of the Rothschilds, and why Godfather III (Qanon actually does mention it) is so much lamer than I and II. For instance, the doctrine mentioned in several press accounts, that Mueller is actually working with Trump and his real target is Hillary/Obama/Pelosi/Abedin/Podesta etc, isn’t something that Qanon, as far as I can find, has ever sad.

The core of QAnon belief is that the political and economic elites which are everyone who is liberal and about half of people who are conservative, belong to a nefarious group called the Cabal who worship Satan. They are also pedophiles, but additionally harvest adrenochrome from children, which they use to get high while performing their Satanic rites. This implausibly cartoonish level of evil justifies an authoritarian purge which dispenses with basically all civil rights. The central figure of this belief system is Donald Trump who they believe has been crafting a plan (known as the Plan) to arrest and destroy the Cabal in an event known as The Storm, which will lead to a glorious future known as the Great Awakening.",0

Children who have been tortured and tricked, have an extremely high tolerance and so have an advantage. The tricks used against them become their tricks against other weaker people-especially people who have been taught honesty. They use pedophilia, and sacrifice as a proof of their psychopathy(I believe psychopaths are probably what are originally considered “demons”).

1448101033884934154,Joe Biden is a clueless pussy,"We already know that this is not the case.

On Monday, just days after Flores published her allegations, a Connecticut woman came forward with a similarly creepy story of an incident in which she says Joe Biden grabbed her by the neck and pulled her close to him – to rub noses.

This strains credulity somewhat; are we really supposed to believe that there was nothing lascivious in Biden’s deep sniff of Flores’ hair? But the line of argument by his defenders is that Biden’s inappropriate touching is not as inappropriate as other men’s inappropriate touching – that he is not as bad, namely, as Donald Trump.",0
1448101033884934154,Joe Biden is a clueless pussy,"In this line of thinking, Biden is not being sexually aggressive when he rubs women’s shoulders, rubs noses with them, or kisses their hair.

1448101033884934154,Joe Biden is a clueless pussy,"Again, this is not entirely believable – it paints a picture of Biden as clueless and unthinking that does not align with his other public behavior. But the argument also fails on its own merits. It is unclear, for instance, why Biden has not adjusted to the social mores of this time, or why his persistent ignorance of them is deemed exonerating. If he is not malicious, but merely incompetent, this is hardly a defense, and it is certainly not an argument that this socially incompetent man should be given the most powerful job in the world. The mandate to understand basic social cues, and to adjust to a world in which women’s bodies are no longer available for opportunistic fondling by white men in their vicinity, are basic requirements for much less powerful positions than the presidency.",0
1448101033884934154,Joe Biden is a clueless pussy,"The argument that Biden’s inappropriate touching of women is somehow innocent also implies that feminists who object to Biden’s brand of touching have set the bar for women’s public dignity too high – especially considering who’s currently in the White House. Wouldn’t you rather have the infantilizing shoulder rubs and hair kisses of Joe Biden, the thinking goes, than the boorish pussy grabbing of Donald Trump? To those who argue that while Trump’s alleged harassment is unacceptable, Biden’s is tolerable, I would reply firmly that women should not have to accept either. A culture that does not tolerate sexual harassment – the kind of culture that ours must become – must not allow for lesser evils to continue simply because worse violations exist. It must value women more highly than that.",0

But early in his career he was a vociferous opponent of abortion rights, a position that he changed belatedly, partially, and without enthusiasm.

By contrast, Kim has explicitly benefitted from her much-talked-about figure, tapping into an audience that sees her as no ordinary white woman, but instead as an exotic and interesting one.",0

1448000103885774848,i told you all Kim is a piece of shit,"It’s a vicious culture that valorizes curves on wealthy, racially ambiguous white women, but stigmatizes these traits on Black women; one that plays into a longtime fascination with the aesthetics of Blackness and an unwillingness to engage with the ugliness of anti-Black racism at the same time. And it’s in the Kardashian-Jenner sisters’ wholehearted embrace of this tension that their family has forever changed the ways society thinks about bodies and beauty, forging the standards that have defined the past decade.",0
1448000103885774848,i told you all Kim is a piece of shit,"Between their loyal viewership on television and massive social media presences (Kim was the most followed person on Instagram in 2015 and currently has the 6th biggest account with 227 million followers), the family blazed a trail for a new model of celebrity: the influencer. The Kardashian-Jenner look is ubiquitous: Heavily contoured makeup, dramatically curvy bodies and plumped lips have had cyclical moments of popularity, but they owe much of their mainstream favor in recent years to the wide influence of the sisters. Even after Keeping Up with the Kardashians ends and the family moves on to their new deal to create content for Disney and Hulu, this legacy will remain.",0
1448000103885774848,i told you all Kim is a piece of shit,"While the allure of the “exotic” white woman is as old as the longtime debates about Cleopatra’s racial background, Kim has pioneered the branding of it as an identity, leveraging it for the creation of a fashion and beauty empire, leaning into the allure of her fame and endless resources to form a brand. From sporting Fulani braids, which have roots in West Africa, and attributing the style to Bo Derek, another white woman, to the multiple times she’s been called out for wearing Blackface by wearing skin-darkening makeup, Kim is no stranger to making deliberate beauty and style choices that rely on racial performance—then turning around and finding ways to capitalize on it. (Kim has staunchly denied doing Blackface—after she was accused of wearing Blackface for a 2017 KKW Beauty campaign, she told the New York Times that she “would obviously never want to offend anyone,” and later replaced the photos.) Despite a cultural appropriation scandal ahead of its launch, her shapewear line SKIMS has found a strong base of customers who put their trust in Kim and her hourglass shape to deliver a product that will support their own curves—or the curves that they get surgically to emulate her. A 2018 study by the American Society for Plastic Surgeons found that butt-enhancing procedures had increased by 256% since 2000.",0

1448000103885774848,i told you all Kim is a piece of shit,"Kim Kardashian West’s original vision for her 40th birthday was to fly all of her friends to Wyoming for a “wild, wild Miss West” party, where, one presumes, her signature taupe shapewear would complement the rocky vistas. But, as Kim said in a recent episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians, “with COVID, I just don’t honestly feel like now is the time to celebrate anything.” Bummer—but not too big a bummer, because her family still organized an elaborate surprise bash at a studio in Los Angeles. Ponies, like the ones she rode for her first birthday, stood at the venue’s entrance, where attendees were made to take coronavirus tests. Sundaes were served at a mocked-up version of the diner Kim had partied at as an 8-year-old. The nightclub Tao, that hot 2000s palace of Patrón and EDM, was recreated in miniature. “All my favorite people were there—all my best friends and family,” Kim told E!’s cameras after smizing her way through this pop-up museum of her life. “And that’s really all that I needed.”",0
1448000103885774848,i told you all Kim is a piece of shit,"It was, however, clearly not all she needed. By now the internet is well aware that Kim also rang in her 40th year by flying dozens of people to a private tropical island. Attendees were not told where they were going, but they were told to quarantine beforehand and pack for sunny fun, as well as for three fancy dinners. In late October, when about 220,000 Americans had died from the coronavirus and 11 million were unemployed, Kim spammed social media with photos of beach banquets and boat rides. “I surprised my closest inner circle with a trip to a private island where we could pretend things were normal just for a brief moment in time,” she wrote. “I realize that for most people, this is something that is so far out of reach right now, so in moments like these, I am humbly reminded of how privileged my life is.”",0

Social-media users paired Kardashian’s photo captions with images of cursed paradises: the Fyre Festival, a Game of Thrones wedding hall, a Midsommar ceremony, Hieronymus Bosch’s Garden of Earthly Delights. Other responses to Kardashian’s vacation pics simply expressed white-hot offense. One tweet with 4,300 likes: “You know what would have felt normal for me, Kim? Not having to say goodbye to my mother over FaceTime as she was dying of COVID … Rubbing in this in our faces is cruel & clueless.” Another tweet (from the rocker Peter Frampton, who has surely done some reckless partying in his time): “Are you that insensitive you don’t realise this is not what the majority of people during the worst covid spike yet want to hear? People are going to food banks not private islands.”",0

Less than a week after Kim posted her pictures, her sister Kendall Jenner faced backlash for throwing herself a Halloween birthday bash with 100 people in a West Hollywood bar. In a video, you can see Kendall blow out candles on a cake held by a masked server who appears to move his head away from her outflow of droplets. Soon after that, Kourtney Kardashian endorsed a baseless theory that surgical masks—a cheap and effective means of curbing COVID-19—cause cancer. The impression had been cemented: The Kardashians were proving that a certain kind of celebrity is ill-suited for—and might even become obsolete during—the coronavirus era.",0

Her flawless, timeless style is one of our favorite things about this star. It turns out, even superstars like Lopez have to get their inspiration from somewhere.

Veruschka was a supermodel in the '60s, and, of course, Jackie Onassis was the First Lady in the '60s. Monroe was a star in the '50s and '60s — it sounds like Lopez is heavily influenced by the glamorous mod styles of the mid-20th century — combined with the grunge twist of Madonna.

You probably remember her performances in films like ""Selena,"" ""Gigli,"" and ""Maid in Manhattan,"" and her hit songs ""On The Floor,"" ""Love Don't Cost a Thing,"" and ""Ain't Your Mama."" Lopez was born in 1970 in Bronx, New York to a Puerto Rican family. She got her start as a dancer in the show ""In Living Color."" Eventually, she landed her breakthrough role in the 1997 biopic ""Selena"" about the late beloved singer and, just one year later, began recording her first album. The rest is history. We all know about the countless successes throughout Lopez's career, but there are a few things even the biggest JLo fans may not know — like how she got her famous nickname. Here are a few things you never knew about Jennifer Lopez.",1

I hate Jennifer Lopez to this day,"We shouldn't even be telling you why Jennifer Lopez should be your WCW -- you should know by now. From her oh-so catchy songs to the killer dance moves, the ""American Idol"" judge is also an expert multi-tasker. How many pop star-turned-moguls can promote a new movie, release an album AND be loving mom to two children all while looking as sexy as ever? Jenny From the Block has us crushing hard and these are just a few the many reasons why.
• She Had Us 'Feelin' So Good' With 'On the 6' In 1999, Jennifer dropped her debut album, including instant hits like ""If You Had My Love"" and ""Feelin' So Good.""
• Let's take a moment to admire the Charbel Zoe dress that was her 2014 VMA look; her 2015 Oscars Elie Saab gown; and her most iconic outfit: the infamous, green Versace dress worn at the 2000 Grammy Awards. But we'd be here all day if we recapped every red carpet event J.Lo killed with her hot bod and her body-con style.
• I think a lot of us would be more open to critique if it were coming from Judge Lopez.
• She Had Us 'Waiting for Tonight' On The Eve Of Y2K I'm pretty sure Jennifer's ""Waiting for Tonight"" was the reason Y2K was a bust. She saved us all with her sequined sexiness.
• J.Lo's portrayal of the late Selena Quintanilla was a pivotal moment in launching her career. Not only did audiences around the world fall in love with Selena's story but they also fell in love with the actress who played her. We have a feeling Drake may have been put on to Selena by J.Lo just like we were.
• She Got 'Loud' At The 2000 Super Bowl HalfTime Performance That's right, before there was a Beyonce Super Bowl performance or Katy Perry and her Left Shark, J.Lo brought down the stadium with her ""Let's Get Loud"" single -- just the motivation you need at halftime!
• We Got Swept Away By 'Maid In Manhattan' How many times has TBS replayed this movie? Probably because it's GOLD. If you say you don't love Jennifer in this twist on a modern-day Cinderella story, I'd call you a liar.
• She Made 2014 The Year Of The Booty ... Again Step aside, Kim Kardashian. J.Lo's signature asset set her apart from the Hollywood stars of the early 2000s. And she's been all about that bass ever since.
• And Because Jenny From The Block Really Is Still The 'Same Girl' From the 2002 single release of ""Jenny From the Block"" to her latest album Same Girl, no one can deny that Lopez is still the proud, outspoken, go-getter Latina from the South Bronx.",0

""Now, understand, I had never done a triathlon before,"" she wrote. ""I had run a 10K when I was 12, but never anything close to a triathlon. On the morning of the race, as I was standing there surrounded by a thousand paparazzi, about to jump into the ocean, I realized that this probably wasn't the best idea I ever had."" Though some might consider Lopez participating in a triathlon a left-field move, it's actually not surprising. She's athletic and used to be part of her high school's track team.",0

I hate Jennifer Lopez to this day,"I read a lot of negative things about her on here and have to say, that was not my experience. I worked in an Asian fusion restaurant in Chicago as a waiter, when Jennifer Lopez and some others came in to dine. I did not get the chance to serve her. Her and her entourage racked up a huge bill, it was a little over 6000 dollars. The gentleman who paid the bill left less than 10%. The next morning she can back into the restaurant and spoke with our manager. She apologized for the poor tip, and gave him several envelopes containing cash. She gave her server a 2000dollar tip and everyone else that worked as a server that night 1000 each! J-Lo paid my rent for two months. Hard to say she was awful after that, That was my experience.",1

She is honest and will tell you if she doesn't have time to take one or sign.. but she doesn't do it in a negative or stuck up movie star way.

I hate Jennifer Lopez to this day,"Jennifer Lopez is one of those polarising celebrities who people have a great deal of admiration for or despise because of the way she conducts herself, and this is why she is the perfect candidate for the “ Tall poppy syndrome “. When you become pigeon holed with this unwanted reference many people are determined to criticise your every choice and bring you down the popularity ladder as quickly as possible and soon forget about all your positive contributions to noble causes that people in those positions are able to do. A lot of people mix up being talked about a lot and in the headlines constantly and connect it to being famous and can’t really understand why when they take a minute to analyse what they have actually accomplished to become famous. Don’t get me wrong Lopez has accumulated a substantial body of work to be considered famous and this is proven by being recognised wherever she goes. She began acting in the mid 90s and her breakthrough came playing the lead role in Selena and was paid almost a million dollars for the role and established her as the highest paid Latino Female Actress at the time. She then turned her attention to singing and immediately found success there after already being an accomplished dancer. She has set up her own foundation and given millions to worthy charities. She defied the typical stereotypical Hollywood Female look with her curvy physique and its rumoured she insured her arse for millions. After a couple of hit movies and albums she began to have feuds with other Hollywood females mainly Maria Carey over reportedly stolen music and miming her material on stage, then spilling over to competing against one another as to who was the biggest. In terms of music Carey had much more success and sold many more albums but when social media began to become more popular Lopez has many more followers on all platforms and is increasing by the month. She purposefully uses this to stay relevant as her music and acting have slowed significantly by continuously posting comments that will immediately cause conflicting views and keep her famous.",0

The City Council told him that he could only have a 30 foot pole but he refused to take it down. They told him they would fine him $1000 a day until he took it down. He said fine, that's chump change. When the fine reached $120,000 he went to the city council and made a deal. He would lower the flag to a 30 foot pole if he could donate the $120,000 to the Veterans Affairs, to which they agreed. He took 50 foot pole down and had a landscape company come in and build a 20 foot hill where the pole was and put up a 30 foot pole. Lol... That's why we love the guy.",0

 * Chief among these are his vow—on which he has delivered with resounding success—to appoint conservative judges at all levels who are likely to overturn or limit the rights established by previous ‘activist’ jurists relating to abortion, gender issues, racial issues, unions, immigration, the environment and a wide range of other topics
 * By pointing a spotlight at China’s activities and pulling back on prior obligations to ‘allied’ nations, he reinforces the concept of ‘American Exceptionalism, clearly defines a foreign enemy, and promises to reduce American involvement internationally
 * For those single-issue voters who strongly support the State of Israel and the policies of its conservative government, his move of the US Embassy to Jerusalem and support for settlements is, by itself, enough reason to vote for him in perpetuity
 * By prioritizing near-term economic benefits over long-term challenges (such as the environment and the rise of automation) he is able to take credit for a strong stock market, which—if you are a middle or upper class voter with public equity assets—is a strong, direct benefit to your bank account
 * By his relentless attacks on the media, scientists, his opponents, and imaginary enemies, he reinforces and—as he is the President of the United States—legitimatizes any pre-existing skepticism about science, the media and the democratic process
The stronger one’s belief is in the above list relative to other issues (character, climate crisis, equal rights, immigration, science, decorum, governmental traditions, etc.) the less those other issues matter, regardless of how strongly other people may feel about them, or how many more points continue to pile up on that side of the table.",0

Trump has done a lot already in reforming immigration thru regulations that I made a post about earlier including public charge rule, remain in mexico, crack down on certain visas, travel bans, more. A nation has to secure the borders and safety is the number 1 priority of any president",1

Energy policy: Trump has deregulated the energy sector and pushed for more energy and drilling which is powering this economic boom and contributed to an unemployment rate of 3.5%. I’m canadian I wish we could do this in canada. However we’re stuck with a sycophantic disgusting POS in trudeau. Energy deregulation means more jobs for those in the energy sector, lower gas prices for everyone, america now is a net energy exporter thing about that, economic boom benefits everyone too",1

Same with Free speech on college campuses, even on abortion. I think most people agree with the Bill clinton view of the 90s: abortion should be safe legal but RARE! Dems in virginia and newyork want abortion after the baby is born, which is a disgusting practice. Therefore every moment that trump is president it means these radical dems arent’ in power and pushing the virginia or ny policies all across america",1

Though, he had an excellent trade team (bob lighthizer is a genius) while we in canada had an investigative journalist in Freeland who was our lead negotiator. A complete fool. No wonder we got owned. Now the US had the upper hand being a much bigger economy and so we’d always get a crappy deal but Freeland and lighthizer made sure that Canada got a horrible deal. Where we can all however be proud is that this president is getting something from China. Yes i’m not a always trumper who thinks the phase 1 china deal is now gonna fix all of our problems. However the fact, that someone sent a message to china, made them buy large quantities of US products, is a good thing. We should all be cheering this on.",1

And I fucking Hate Donald Trump! 😠","There are certainly legitimate reasons to vote for Trump, even if you are a good, right-thinking and patriotic American citizen. The Number One reason you would vote for Trump is the reason he states himself — the Supreme Court. If Trump is elected he has stated he will put hard-core conservatives on the court. Assuming he could get them past the Senate, this is what Republicans want more than anything. The next president is going to be able to appoint at least two SC justices. If it’s Hillary and she has a Democratic Senate, then one can assume more Justices like Sotomayor or Breyer. The best the Republicans could ever hope for under Hillary is another O’Connor. Certainly not another Kennedy. Control of the Supreme Court by ideologues like Alito, who really may be mad, is the biggest reason for Republicans to vote for Trump.",1

They believe the States should be more powerful than the Federal government and if you feel that way, then Trump is your man.

And I fucking Hate Donald Trump! 😠","I have been a liberal practically all of my life (29 years). I am an atheist, and my first ever Presidential vote was cast for John Kerry. I more or less despised George Bush, and even though I leaned toward Hillary in 2008, I voted for Obama in 2012. I support gay marriage, legalization of marijuana, and many other liberal positions. I do, however, believe that our country is in a terrible position and on a terrible track. Trump strikes many of my nerves, but one of the most accurate and dangerously true statements he has made is that “America doesn’t win anymore.” I agree. The world is rising while America falls. America and its leaders seem resigned to this fact. Rather than stiffening their spine and fighting to make America a prosperous nation for all, they simply talk, go through the motions, throw out a few “red meat” issues to keep their respective bases satisfied, and continue to concede American jobs and economic strength to the rest of the world. To friends and family, I have long railed against the fact that America uses Presidential rejects and other back-bench political cronies as their chief negotiators. John Kerry (yes, the man I voted for) was out-negotiated time and time again by his Russian counterpart. And now, it appears that the same thing has happened once again with the Iran negotiators. This all ties back to the same fundamental thread: politicians have failed this country, leading to one loss after another. I do not believe that I am a racist, sexist, homophobic, or any other negative label that has been affixed to Trump supports. Rather, I feel that political correctness has run amok in this country, and we now live in a society where every blogger and Twitter user is searching for the slightest offense so they can try to ruin another human (famous, or not). The average person is afraid of expressing any controversial opinion in a public forum for fear of being “exposed,” made viral, and ruined, personally and/or professionally. It is heartening to see someone as confident and impervious to criticism as Trump standing up to this ever-present mob … and winning! People tend to support the underdog. Most media outlets have attacked Trump with so much vitriol that they have turned him into a sympathetic figure. Yes, I really do feel that Donald Trump has the interests of America at heart. He has already made his money and lived a life of glamour and fame, and another few billion dollars won’t have any real impact on his quality of life. Rather, I genuinely believe that Trump feels the need to fight for the country he loves. There once was a time when people could actually feel proud to be Americans, and Trump comes from a generation that experienced that feeling. Now, many are embarrassed to be associated with this country. Jobs are being outsourced with reckless abandon and this country is literally being hollowed out. Economic statistics do no justice to this reality, and the average American knows this to be true. Trump supporters feel that a confident, strong-willed leader is needed to right the ship and to fight back against the perpetual decline this country has experienced for the last two-plus decades. And to be honest, I feel that Trump is our only hope in this next election. This is coming from someone who voted for Obama in the last election! Anyway, that’s my story and the main reasons why I support Trump. I didn’t plan out this response for days or try to make this all-inclusive, but this should give you a fair idea of why I, a liberal, support Donald Trump for president.",0

And I fucking Hate Donald Trump! 😠","Thanks for your article. I’m quite a fan of your writing and The Atlantic. I figured I’d take you up on your offer to discuss why I am voting for Donald Trump, if I get the opportunity. I live in New Jersey and usually by the time the primaries get around to me both tickets are decided. Still, I plan on voting for Trump if he is the Republican nominee and will likely pull the lever for him if he runs as an independent. A bit about my background so you don’t think I’m some sort of fire breathing know-nothing. I am a 39-year-old who earns well into the six figures as a communications executive for a hospital. I have had a long career in journalism and public relations. I have been married to my first and only wife for 12 years; she’s a nurse at a local hospital. I have two boys, aged 10 and 8. One has ADHD (my 10 year old) and one has autism (my eight year old), so I’m plugged into the disabled community. I am a devout Christian and attend a local Methodist church in my area that typically has about 450 people on a Sunday morning across two services. I’m white. There was a time in my life where I was intimately familiar with politics and enjoyed engaging in all the arguments. I think my interest stopped right around 2008 because everything started to get really nasty. I read somewhere that family members weren’t speaking to each other over political disagreements. I have one brother. He voted for Obama; I voted for McCain. We disagree politically, but he’s the only brother I have and we love each other as brothers do. I cannot imagine our political preferences coming between us. It was also around this time that I started noticing political discourse going from intellectual to downright nasty at all levels, with people losing jobs over their political views in extreme cases. Politically you could say I’m conservative, but the truth is I no longer care about the liberal vs. conservative arguments. What I want is a country that works and will continue to work for my kids and their kids. Our current elected leadership seems to have no other interest except defeating the opposition, and then when that happens, holding their position through excessive demonizing of their opponents. So why do I support Trump? Because he’s an authentic leader. I think he’s just what the country needs right now to wake it out of its stupor. We’ve got serious problems, but we spend all our time shouting about whether gays should be allowed to marry. Neither liberals nor conservatives have solid ideas about how to move us forward, and the lack of civility in our discourse prevents them from working together. What results is a paralysis that might be amusing if there wasn’t so much to be done. Why do I think Trump would be better? He’s led large organizations before. There hasn’t been much examination of his business beyond his bankruptcies and the fact that he inherited large sums. However, by all accounts he leads an enormous, diversified organization that is worth billions. This requires leadership. Leadership, by the way, is different from knowledge. When you lead a large organization you set vision, goals and expect results. You do not know every detail of every level of your organization. You can’t. The world is too complicated. You delegate and empower. You can get information when you need it and the president has no shortage of people ready to educate him on issues. He’s a negotiator. I think this part has been under-discussed, and is probably his greatest asset. He’s spent his whole life and career making deals and negotiating deals. In his own words, he negotiates to win. This is a skill, and it’s one that we should learn to value. The current presidential dichotomy has us either electing a liberal or conservative with clearly defined policy views that are not open for negotiation. How does that move us forward? We need to get creative and we need to negotiate. I believe Donald Trump will be able to do that. Let me now deal with what I think the main objections to his candidacy have been: One, he has no political experience. While he doesn’t have any elective experience, it’s not true that he doesn’t have any political experience. He’s been leading a large organization and working with officials constantly; this requires political deftness that frankly might be better than what our current elected officials have to offer. Two, he doesn’t have specific policy positions. This is a standard negotiating technique. You don’t show your hand publicly. Frankly, I like this better than electing a doctrinaire liberal or conservative who is going to Washington with predefined policy ideas that are rooted in solid philosophies and not open for debate. Three, he’s a rude blowhard. There is some merit to this. It is abundantly clear that Trump loves the spotlight, and he does say things that make you shake your head and groan. He clearly loves attention, but while this is a flaw I’m not sure it’s a fatal one. Take the Megyn Kelly flap. I think her question was misguided. It focused on his public statements. I would ask if he has ever been sued for sexual harassment by any of his employees. So far, no one has stepped forward to say that Trump was ever sexually inappropriate toward them, and if there were any out there I am sure they would have been found by now. When The Apprentice was in its first couple of hit seasons, one of the executives at the judging table was a woman. He’s also raised a daughter, Ivanka, who by all accounts is a solid business executive in her own right who loves her father. His woman problem is a bit overblown, I think. And he did make a good point during the debate. We’ve got serious problems in this country; we shouldn’t be making a big deal over the prospective president’s tone.",0

And I fucking Hate Donald Trump! 😠","You asked for it. Here is my pedantic speech on why I will be voting for Trump! First: he has brought to life the silent majority, who have quietly fumed about the corruption that runs rampant in our government. Our government merrily believes they have pulled the wool over our eyes to the atrocities they routinely commit. Trump has taken these atrocities Mainstream! He daily reminds all the crooked politicians that they have been bought and paid for! The People knew it before, but Trump is reminding us that it is NOT acceptable! It is NOT wrong that Trump has given money to these people to do his bidding, it IS WRONG that these people took his money and DID his bidding! We get that Trump gave them money for a few little building permits––but what do the Koch Bros, George Soros and especially the drug and insurance companies need to give them money for? He is a Motivator! Second: People used to getting their own way grow angry at Trump because he is stepping on their toes. We are encouraged that he is doing the right thing. We watch Fox News and the RNC stab him in the back repeatedly despite his being a wildly popular Republican candidate that they should be embracing. And we ask ourselves, what does he know? What could he tell us that we don’t already suspect? We want to know what is so super-special secret that other billionaires are trying to trip up one of their own! Wouldn’t you think they would want one of their own in the catbird seat? Third, Trump calls out the media routinely, the same media that is failing to accurately portray the situation in Ferguson and other towns and makes it seem like there is a huge race war going on. The media who is so agenda-based and who fail gloriously to state the unbiased facts. The media who are intent on manipulating people to vote for who they say and to believe what they say and to follow how they say. The media, who originally was designed to JUST REPORT THE FACTS and is now the primary engine with which our leaders and government controls the masses who blindly follow them. The people hate the media, but when Joe Schmoe complains about a news program lying, no one hears him. When Donald Trump complains about a news program lying, EVERYONE hears him! Fourth, it is because we have watched for the last 100+ years as government officials made decisions that are appalling and destructive to the well-being of our great nation, and we think to ourselves, “WTH did they do something that grossly derelict for?” Trump tells us it is because our leaders are stupid. We know the truth, it is because our leaders are CROOKED! Trump gets a bye here and the reason is this—from Trump’s perspective, the politicians he purchases like candy do seem extremely stupid. He watches them selling out their own kind for a few bucks and think how truly silly they look to him. You see it time and again throughout history. Traitors are never respected by the people they turncoat to! Our choice is simple: we absolutely dont want to elect someone who is disdained by the Donald. We’ve had our fair share of Vasili Mitrokhins. Donald is travelling in many of the same circles as the leaders of other countries and you may forget that the US is a very powerful country and has enormous leverage in the hands of the right negotiator. Our current negotiator sold us out for a cheap farm in Egypt and even sold out his own daughter for goodness sakes, will she be wife number 3 or 4??? Donald knows that he has a very valuable asset and will use it to every advantage. It is his nature to make the best deal possible! Fifth: Trump is a negotiator and his experience speaks volumes. Granted, maybe he will negotiate deals that benefit him. However, Trump is a real-estate Tycoon and many of his holdings are here in the good ole USofA, so if any one would negotiate a real deal that would benefit our country for a change, it would be Trump! While Trump may very well have his own best interests at heart it’s ok: his best interest is our best interest and that best interest is our property values and our economy. When our economy tanks, his property values go DOWN! If anyone would be interested in saving our country, it would be someone whose salary is directly tied to the value of the country we call the USA! It doesn’t do any good if you own 10 beautiful hotels and golf courses in these United States if there is not anyone who can visit them! Atlantic City, which he is continually questioned about, is a perfect example. Trump didnt destroy the economy in Atlantic City, its economy tanked and Trump’s businesses with it. I like to think he would have a vendetta against the politician that sold out Atlantic City and by association, Trump. Sixth, it is because of questions like yours from people who don’t see the need to dream or hope for a greater America and are content to keep watching it go by the wayside as long as their pockets are lined. People who are waiting until we are no better than Zimbabwe, where the biggest crime is to be a white Man! These same people who won’t take a risk or jump off a sinking ship because they haven’t finished their lobster!",0

And I fucking Hate Donald Trump! 😠","In summation, it’s because WE still believe our country can be great again and WE need a leader to go before us that embodies our beliefs, one whose life is affected by our lives. A few hundred years ago, our ancestors came to this country for a fresh start because their homeland had become unbearable to live in. This land was the LAST frontier! Our backs are against the wall now: we do not have any other land to which we can all sail our rickety boats with our few belongings! We do not have any other leader who embodies all that we believe. Our forefathers may have thought “America or Bust”––we are now at the “Bust” part and if we don’t fix our great country! So in conclusion, he is our Joan D’Arc, repeatedly betrayed by his own kind and given to lead us at his own expense! He is fighting OUR battle and it is OUR responsibility to back him!",0

And I fucking Hate Donald Trump! 😠","Thank you for being curious about what people think, something that the mainstream media has long forgotten about. The problem: you assume to know the reasons why people support Trump––that we believe he will be a more caring and responsible president with a lesser self-interest. Honestly, I don’t think there is a single person in the world who believes that about the Donald. Here are the reasons why we like Trump. First, some insight into how many of the people around me feel about the world and its recent history: 1) Bush: we learned that an administration can be careless, brutal, dishonest and deceptive to an extent no one would have thought possible. $10 trillion destroyed, 5000+ Americans killed, the American brand destroyed; torture, lies and terrible people representing America. These people represented the Washington establishment, and created an atmosphere of total distrust in anything established. The poor and underprivileged felt cheated on and totally left behind; the wealthy and educated watched in total disbelief how the layers of civilized discourse and governance where obliterated by incompetence, cronyism and evilness on an epic scale. The world went into shock, losing America as its first and last hope. It was a––watch for it––DISASTER. 2) Obama: I supported Obama the first time, and reluctantly the second time. I think he saved America. BUT. Obama failed big time in overcoming the partisan divide. He put his cronies in charge. Worst of all, he appears weak. Like an intellectual. Intellectuals make simple things complicated, and FAIL in real life. Because while real life may be complicated, you create progress by making it simple. By getting things done. Stop thinking, start doing. Stop considering, make a decision. Yes, go with your gut (unless you are Bush, because your gut sucks). 3) The two parties: So basically, going with your gut failed (Bush) and going with your brain feels like a failure too (Obama). That’s because the personnel, especially on the gut side, is just terrible. Absolutely terrible. Cruz? Perry? BUSH? Palin? Romney? McCain? Where do these people come from? How can they happen? On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton might be a good person, maybe even a good president, but she is a terrible politician and so, so bad in talking to us. Just so bad. 4) The media: CNN has catvideos on their homepage. MSNBC has followed FOX to become a blatant agenda-setting propaganda machine. Their pundits don’t serve the viewers, but their own personal agenda. It’s political correctness and propaganda all over the place. Listen, I have my beliefs. But I am annoyed at these people, even if they propagate my beliefs, because of the stupid, obnoxious way they do it. Take pro-choice vs. pro-life, and the gay marriage debate. Where do I stand on these topics? I am PRO STARTUPS. We need more entrepreneurs. We need more innovation. More growth. How is that related to pro-choice and gay marriage? IT ISN’T. I DON’T CARE. I AM NOT INTERESTED. STOP TALKING ABOUT IT! We don’t care. Gays can now marry, that’s fine with me. Abortion has been regulated for decades exactly how it should be regulated. It’s fine. It’s a non-issue. We have to stop talking about complete nonsense, and start talking about Making America Great Again. Oh, and every time the media tries to put him down, his polls will go up. Because everything Americans can do to show the media they are wrong, they will do at this point. 5) Trump: So here we are. That’s why I like Trump. Everytime I see another spineless, dumb, corrupt politician preparing for another failure (representing it all: BUSH), I have to close my laptop. It’s so, so unbelievable and gross. Every time I see MSNBC and the NYT stuff their agendas down my throat, I have to throw up. Fox? I don’t even go there. Obama? He has failed to make D.C. work. So there is Trump. Someone who finally, finally focuses on important topics. He says the obvious: illegal immigration is a disaster. Obamacare is very bad, but not for the reasons the right claims. Planned Parenthood is important for millions of young women, and defunding it is another GOP scandal. The Democrats suck so much he doesn’t even attack them. He says that ISIS can be destroyed by going for their oil and their Saudi backers. Umm … that’s the most profound and smart thing I have heard in a long time. He says we get ripped off by the Chinese and Mexican governments. Umm … Yes. He says foreign policy is dealmaking, and he will force Putin, Iran etc. into submission, and they will be happy about it (because it will be a good deal). Umm … yes he is right. Of course, the pundits and academic elites are piling on how he has no idea about economics and foreign policy, and how he is a fraud that dumb people fall for. Guess what? They just called me dumb. Now here is the problem. The arrogance and ignorance––together, the dumbness––of these “elites” at the NYT, economics departments, etc. is the true source of misinterpretation of the Trump movement. We are not dumb. We are investment bankers, Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, rocket scientists. And yes, we might also be farmers, but farmers can actually also be quite smart. But guess what. We believe YOU (not you, Conor), are very, very dumb. If you are an established economist, you understand NOTHING about economics, and now everyone knows it. If you are the NYT, you printed fake evidence that led to a corrupt and bankrupting war. We believe you are very, very dumb, and shouldn’t say anything, whatsoever. You lost ALL authority over the last 15 years. Most people around me could take on any NYT journalist or professor from whatever fancy school and destroy them––intellectually––on any stage, anytime. We laugh at these people, and we laugh when they are called “elites”. They are not elites, they are complete failures. They have a poor understanding of the world we live in, they do not understand economics, they do not understand foreign policy. They respond by saying we are the angry, disenfranchised mob in the South and Midwest. The problem is that we are technology entrepreneurs and finance professionals in New York and Silicon Valley. Many of us probably sit next door to you. And every time you paint this picture, it strengthens our belief that you are so intellectually stuck and close-minded it’s not even worth talking to you anymore. If you think Trump, Carl Icahn and Steve Schwarzman are disenfranchised angry people who don’t understand economics or foreign policy, something is wrong with you. All this ignorance is also why Bernie Sanders is so popular. And I bet there are more Bernie Sanders supporters who also like Trump than the “experts” think. I am one of them. My second choice would be Bernie Sanders. It is not hard to lead the U.S. The U.S. is an amazing country that has everything we need. All a president has to do is not to be a completely incompetent moron, do a deal here and there, and make sure the most obvious things get done. It is really, really easy. But for some reason, we can’t get a candidate through the party system that is not a completely incompetent moron. And no, we don’t think Donald Trump is in it to help us. Or anyone else other than himself. But he has his pride. He truly wants to make America Great Again, the same way he wanted to make his company great. He is unlikely to fail as a president, because he doesn’t like to lose. It’s that simple. And I truly trust him with that. Also, gross cronyism requires a small mind. Someone with the grandesse of a Donald will not do little crony cheats. There are a series of different concerns I have based on his personality, but they all pale in comparison to many past presidents and the current options and I have to stop my rantings now. If you really read through all this, I am very impressed. Thanks for opening up a channel. If you write a piece that explains the Trump phenomenon accurately, you will be famous. Interview a bunch of (diverse) supporters, analyze who they are and why they support him.",0

I'm not, contrary to popular belief, a Republican. But Kanye West was using a really big stick in saying that. And I think it's interesting when called upon it, he seems embarrassed and retreats.

And one indication of that is that somebody who was as deeply unpopular a president as George Bush could take it as even significant that a rapper called him a racist, I believe that for him that really would have been one of the lowest moments of his presidency. Because the sting of being called a racist is so potent that even if you are the president of the United States and the leader of the free world, if somebody with a certain kind of influence, and hip-hop has a very powerful influence, calls you a racist, then wow, that can throw you off of your game like almost nothing else could.",0

I think that if you look at what actually happened in New Orleans and the effect of that hurricane, the one thing that he did have to say, the president, which was when he talked to Trent Lott, he said well, some day we'll be sitting on your porch sipping lemonade after it's been rebuilt.

There was racism for 200 years then another 80 years of Jim Crow laws, and finally within the last generation, Civil Rights Act, Voting Rights Act, etcetera, has loosened those bonds of oppression. You can't have a black person being racist towards a white person. They can be bigoted - that's not - no doubt about it, but they can't be racist. Racism can only flow from power to non-power.

Federal officials found evidence [ http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/24/opinion/sunday/is-donald-trump-a-racist.html ] that Trump had refused to rent to black tenants and lied to black applicants about whether apartments were available, among other accusations. Trump said the federal government was trying to get him to rent to welfare recipients. In the aftermath, he signed an agreement in 1975 agreeing not to discriminate to renters of color without admitting to discriminating before.

This matches much of his current rhetoric on China.
 * 1989: In a controversial case that’s been characterized as a modern-day lynching, four black teenagers and one Latino teenager — the ""Central Park Five"" — were accused of attacking and raping a jogger in New York City. Trump immediately took charge in the case, running an ad in local papers [ http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/01/nyregion/trumps-instinct-for-racially-charged-rhetoric-before-his-presidential-bid.html ] demanding, ""BRING BACK THE DEATH PENALTY.

But Trump in October 2016 said [ http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-central-park-five_us_57f7ceafe4b0e655eab3c002 ] he still believes they’re guilty, despite the DNA evidence to the contrary.

I hate it. The only kind of people I want counting my money are short guys that wear yarmulkes every day. … I think that the guy is lazy. And it’s probably not his fault, because laziness is a trait in blacks. It really is, I believe that. It’s not anything they can control."" Trump at first denied the remarks, but later said in a 1997 Playboy interview [ http://www.playboy.com/articles/the-art-of-the-donald ] that ""the stuff O’Donnell wrote about me is probably true.""
 * 1992: The Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino had to pay a $200,000 fine [ http://www.upi.com/Archives/1992/10/19/Trump-Plaza-loses-appeal-of-discrimination-penalty/1911719467200/ ] because it transferred black and women dealers off tables to accommodate a big-time gambler’s prejudices.
 * 2000: In opposition to a casino proposed by the St. Regis Mohawk tribe, which he saw as a financial threat to his casinos in Atlantic City, Trump secretly ran a series of ads [ http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/01/nyregion/trumps-instinct-for-racially-charged-rhetoric-before-his-presidential-bid.html ] suggesting the tribe had a ""record of criminal activity [that] is well documented.""

""You're an unbelievably talented guy in terms of education, and you haven’t done anything,"" Trump said on the show. ""At some point you have to say, ‘That’s enough.’""
 * 2005: Trump publicly pitched [ http://www.vox.com/2016/5/19/11716012/donald-trump-apprentice-race ] what was essentially The Apprentice: White People vs. Black People. He said [ https://www.buzzfeed.com/mckaycoppins/donald-trump-wanted-a-white-versus-black-season-of-the-appre?utm_term=.nbOypgbOyg#.teymNdKAmd ] he ""wasn't particularly happy"" with the most recent season of his show, so he was considering ""an idea that is fairly controversial — creating a team of successful African Americans versus a team of successful whites. Whether people like that idea or not, it is somewhat reflective of our very vicious world.""
 * 2010: In 2010, there was a huge national controversy over the ""Ground Zero Mosque"" — a proposal to build a Muslim community center in Lower Manhattan, near the site of the 9/11 attacks. Trump opposed the project, calling it ""insensitive,"" and offered to buy out [ http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704644404575482093330879912 ] one of the investors in the project.

 * 2011: Trump played a big role [ http://www.vox.com/2016/5/4/11591114/donald-trump-obama-seth-meyers-white-house-correspondents-dinner ] in pushing false rumors that Obama — the country’s first black president — was not born in the US. He even sent investigators to Hawaii to look into Obama's birth certificate [ http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2011/04/07/trump-sends-investigators-to-hawaii-to-look-into-obama/ ]. Obama later released his birth certificate, calling Trump a ""carnival barker.""

Trump has reportedly continued [ https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/28/us/politics/trump-access-hollywood-tape.html?_r=0 ] pushing this conspiracy theory in private.
 * 2011: While Trump suggested that Obama wasn’t born in the US, he also argued that maybe Obama wasn’t a good enough student to have gotten into Columbia or Harvard Law School, and demanded Obama release his university transcripts. Trump claimed [ http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Trump-Obama-Wasnt-Good-Enough-to-Get-into-Ivy-Schools-120657869.html ], ""I heard he was a terrible student. Terrible. How does a bad student go to Columbia and then to Harvard?""
For many people, none of these incidents, individually, may be totally damning: One of these alone might suggest that Trump is simply a bad speaker and perhaps racially insensitive (""politically incorrect,"" as he would put it), but not overtly racist.",0

His campaign was largely built on building a wall to keep these immigrants out of the US.
 * As a candidate in 2015, Trump called [ http://www.vox.com/2015/12/7/9867900/donald-trump-muslims ] for a ban on all Muslims coming into the US. His administration’s attempts at implementing a watered-down version of this policy have been contested in courts [ https://www.vox.com/2017/12/4/16735466/muslim-ban-trump-who ].
 * When asked at a 2016 Republican debate whether all 1.6 billion Muslims hate the US, Trump said [ http://www.vox.com/2016/3/10/11199998/rubio-trump-cnn-republican-debate-islam-muslims ], ""I mean a lot of them. I mean a lot of them.""
 * He argued [ http://www.vox.com/2016/6/3/11848382/donald-trump-racism-media ] in 2016 that Judge Gonzalo Curiel — who was overseeing the Trump University lawsuit [ http://www.vox.com/2016/6/1/11827596/trump-university-scam ] — should recuse himself from the case because of his Mexican heritage and membership in a Latino lawyers association. House Speaker Paul Ryan, who endorsed Trump, later called [ http://www.vox.com/2016/6/7/11875850/donald-trump-racist-paul-ryan ] such comments ""the textbook definition of a racist comment.""
 * Trump has been repeatedly slow [ http://www.vox.com/2016/2/28/11129120/donald-trump-david-duke ] to condemn white supremacists who endorse him, and he regularly retweeted [ http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/14/us/politics/donald-trump-white-identity.html?_r=0 ] messages from white supremacists and neo-Nazis during his presidential campaign.
 * He tweeted and later deleted [ http://www.vox.com/2016/7/2/12087532/donald-trump-anti-semitic-clinton-attack ] an image that showed Hillary Clinton in front of a pile of money and by a Jewish Star of David that said, ""Most Corrupt Candidate Ever!"" The tweet had some very obvious anti-Semitic imagery, but Trump insisted [ http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/headlines/20160704-donald-trump-that-wasn-t-a-star-of-david-it-was-a-sheriff-s-badge.ece ] that the star was a sheriff’s badge, and said [ https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/07/06/trump-says-campaign-shouldnt-have-deleted-image-circulated-by-white-supremacists/ ] his campaign shouldn’t have deleted it.
 * Trump has repeatedly referred [ http://www.vox.com/2016/5/16/11684776/elizabeth-warren-pocahontas ] to Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), who has said she has Cherokee ancestors, as ""Pocahontas.""
 * At the 2016 Republican convention, Trump officially seized the mantle of the ""law and order"" candidate [ http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/07/donald-trump-law-and-order-richard-nixon-crime-race-214066 ] — an obvious dog whistle [ http://www.vox.com/2016/2/1/10889138/coded-language-thug-bossy ] playing to white fears of black crime, even though crime in the US is historically low [ http://www.vox.com/2016/7/21/12253314/trump-convention-speech-crime-police-rnc-2016 ]. His speeches, comments, and executive actions [ http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/2/9/14562518/trump-crime-police-orders ] after he took office have continued this line of messaging.
 * In a pitch to black voters [ http://www.vox.com/2016/8/19/12552484/donald-trump-black-voters-lose ] in 2016, Trump said [ http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/19/politics/donald-trump-african-american-voters/ ], ""You’re living in poverty, your schools are no good, you have no jobs, 58 percent of your youth is unemployed. What the hell do you have to lose?""
 * Trump stereotyped [ https://www.vox.com/identities/2017/2/16/14642184/trump-congressional-black-caucus-racism ] a black reporter at a press conference in February 2017. When April Ryan asked him if he plans to meet and work with the Congressional Black Caucus, he repeatedly asked her to set up the meeting — even as she insisted that she’s ""just a reporter.""
 * In the week after white supremacist protests in Charlottesville, Virginia [ https://www.vox.com/identities/2017/8/14/16143168/charlottesville-va-protests ], in August 2017, Trump repeatedly said [ https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/08/trump-defends-white-nationalist-protesters-some-very-fine-people-on-both-sides/537012/ ] that ""many sides"" and ""both sides"" were to blame for the violence and chaos that ensued — suggesting that the white supremacist protesters were morally equivalent to counterprotesters that stood against racism. He also said that there were ""some very fine people"" among the white supremacists. All of this seemed like a dog whistle to white supremacists — and many of them took it as one, with white nationalist Richard Spencer praising [ http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/white-nationalist-leader-richard-spencer-thanks-trump-for-defending-the-truth-in-charlottesville/article/2631630 ] Trump for ""defending the truth.""
 * Throughout 2017, Trump repeatedly attacked [ https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/9/25/16360264/donald-trump-colin-kaepernick ] NFL players who, by kneeling or otherwise silently protesting during the national anthem, demonstrated against systemic racism in America.
 * Trump reportedly said [ https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/23/us/politics/trump-immigration.html ] in 2017 that people who came to the US from Haiti ""all have AIDS,"" and he lamented that people who came to the US from Nigeria would never ""go back to their huts"" once they saw America. The White House denied [ https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/11/us/politics/trump-shithole-countries.html ] that Trump ever made these comments.
 * Speaking about immigration in a bipartisan meeting in January 2018, Trump reportedly asked [ https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-attacks-protections-for-immigrants-from-shithole-countries-in-oval-office-meeting/2018/01/11/bfc0725c-f711-11e7-91af-31ac729add94_story.html?utm_term=.1c5074e3680f ], in reference to Haiti and African countries, ""Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?"" He then reportedly suggested that the US should take more people from countries like Norway. The implication: Immigrants from predominantly white countries are good, while immigrants from predominantly black countries are bad.
 * Trump denied [ https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/14/us/politics/trump-im-not-a-racist.html ] making the ""shithole"" comments, although some senators present at the meeting said [ http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/congress/article194434204.html ] they happened. The White House, meanwhile, suggested [ https://twitter.com/CNNSitRoom/status/951586808621649921 ] that the comments, like Trump’s remarks about the NFL protests, will play well to his base. The only connection between Trump’s remarks about the NFL protests and his ""shithole"" comments is race.
This list is not comprehensive, instead relying on some of the major examples since Trump announced his candidacy. But once again, there’s a pattern of racism and bigotry here that suggests Trump isn’t just misspeaking; it is who he is.

Whether his general lack of affection counts as ""dislike"" or ""prejudice"" is a judgment call.

For example, although having little formal schooling, he was a voracious reader and managed to acquire enough legal education, some of which was thanks to apprenticing himself to a lawyer, such that he was able to pass the necessary exams and become an attorney himself.  Newspapers of his day, long before he became famous, referred to his honesty and his work ethic, both of which served him well as he moved up.  As others have mentioned, when he entered politics, he wrote most of his own speeches; and while not a great public speaker, he was a very effective one, including in debates against his political opponents. (Unlike debates today, back in his day, a debate could go on for hours.)  Throughout his political life, Lincoln distinguished himself, in large part due to how well he expressed his ideas, and his thorough grasp of issues.  All of this is certainly proof of a person with high intelligence.",0

At least try to be an adult,"Second, some people will oppose a President purely for party affiliation and will do so passionately.  Thus, whether it's a democrat or republican in office, there will be some people who hate that individually passionately (mostly b/c of political positions though sometimes it gets tied in to other factors...JFK faced some opposition b/c he was Catholic, a lot of people hate Obama b/c he's perceived as ""un-American"" which gets in to some race issues).  But basically, some dislike is due to partisan issues.  Now,  President Bush gets some extra partisan dislike b/c of the 2004 election with it being decided in the Supreme Court rulings and with so many voters being denied the right to vote in Ohio (which then led to early voting options in Ohio in 2004).  And finally, Karl Rove took a particularly unique approach in the 2004 election.  In previous elections, Presidents (regardless of their party) moved to the center.  The idea was to capture as many independents and centrists as possible.  This led to the public complaint you often heard that it didn't matter who you elected, they all held the same positions.  But in 2003, Rove concluded that the best way for George Bush to get elected was to maximize turnout of the Republican base--and he was right.  So George W. Bush campaigned further to the right than a traditional Republican Presidential candidate, sought to focus his appeal to more traditional GOP right-wing base groups (like evangelicals).  And he did so at the expense of appealing to centrists and independents and moderates.",0

But to officially say ""we torture"" (or more specifically ""we do stuff that other people insist is torture but we're doing to do it and not calling it torture"") was a break for this group of people.

At least try to be an adult,"Fourth, the Bush Administration didn't deal very effectively with three major symbolic events and they became albatrosses around the neck of President Bush:
--Katrina.  Every President has natural disasters.  There is a limit to what you can plan for them.  FEMA, even when they do a good job, becomes a punching bag (b/c the local government doesn't want to step up and say ""yep, we sucked on this one""....it's easier to blame the Feds for getting in the way or not keeping promises or whatever).  But Bush's appointment of Michael Brown and then ""you're doing a heckuva job Brownie"" were really hard to live down for the Administration.  The last President to have such a poorly managed natural disaster was probably Pres. George HW Bush with Hurricane Andrew.
--Iraq.  Despite the success of the surge, there are many people who believe (as I do), that the invasion of Iraq will go down in history as one of the worst foreign policy decisions ever made by a US President.  It will, I believe, be shown to have contributed to destabilizing that region by enabling a pan-Islamist movement.  It's just really really hard to argue Iraq is a positive action.  And if you think I'm wrong on this, just look at the heat that Jeb Bush is taking right now for basically trying not to criticize his brother on this decision--even heat from other Republicans.
--Financial Meltdown of 2007-8.  The Bush Administration didn't really contribute much to WHY this happened (contrary to efforts by a range of partisans, the policies of both the Clinton or Bush administrations weren't major contributors to the meltdowns... you saw collapses of financial firms that held no residential properties, a bunkruptcy of Iceland for godsakes  so to claim it was primarily caused by the government forcing loans to poor homeowners is a load of nonsense).  Ultimately, the Meltdown was about a lot of financial firms making really dumb decisions and counting on someone else to be holding the property or mortgage when it finally went south so they all took a ton of risks and the world paid for it.  And actually, Sec. of the Treasury Henry Paulson was terrific during this time, piecing together stop-gap solutions to keep things from being a catastrophe.  But it happened on Bush's watch (and when that happens, the President always gets some blame).  His speech to the nation about why Paulson's actions were necessary was limp and half-hearted.  At a time when the nation needed vigorous leadership and a visible President, our visible leader was Henry Paulson.",0

At least try to be an adult,"Second, some people will oppose a President purely for party affiliation and will do so passionately.  Thus, whether it's a democrat or republican in office, there will be some people who hate that individually passionately (mostly b/c of political positions though sometimes it gets tied in to other factors...JFK faced some opposition b/c he was Catholic, a lot of people hate Obama b/c he's perceived as ""un-American"" which gets in to some race issues).  But basically, some dislike is due to partisan issues.  Now,  President Bush gets some extra partisan dislike b/c of the 2004 election with it being decided in the Supreme Court rulings and with so many voters being denied the right to vote in Ohio (which then led to early voting options in Ohio in 2004).  And finally, Karl Rove took a particularly unique approach in the 2004 election.  In previous elections, Presidents (regardless of their party) moved to the center.  The idea was to capture as many independents and centrists as possible.  This led to the public complaint you often heard that it didn't matter who you elected, they all held the same positions.  But in 2003, Rove concluded that the best way for George Bush to get elected was to maximize turnout of the Republican base--and he was right.  So George W. Bush campaigned further to the right than a traditional Republican Presidential candidate, sought to focus his appeal to more traditional GOP right-wing base groups (like evangelicals).

At least try to be an adult,"Fourth, the Bush Administration didn't deal very effectively with three major symbolic events and they became albatrosses around the neck of President Bush:
--Katrina.  Every President has natural disasters.  There is a limit to what you can plan for them.  FEMA, even when they do a good job, becomes a punching bag (b/c the local government doesn't want to step up and say ""yep, we sucked on this one""....it's easier to blame the Feds for getting in the way or not keeping promises or whatever).  But Bush's appointment of Michael Brown and then ""you're doing a heckuva job Brownie"" were really hard to live down for the Administration.  The last President to have such a poorly managed natural disaster was probably Pres. George HW Bush with Hurricane Andrew.
--Iraq.  Despite the success of the surge, there are many people who believe (as I do), that the invasion of Iraq will go down in history as one of the worst foreign policy decisions ever made by a US President.  It will, I believe, be shown to have contributed to destabilizing that region by enabling a pan-Islamist movement.  It's just really really hard to argue Iraq is a positive action.  And if you think I'm wrong on this, just look at the heat that Jeb Bush is taking right now for basically trying not to criticize his brother on this decision--even heat from other Republicans.
--Financial Meltdown of 2007-8.  The Bush Administration didn't really contribute much to WHY this happened (contrary to efforts by a range of partisans, the policies of both the Clinton or Bush administrations weren't major contributors to the meltdowns... you saw collapses of financial firms that held no residential properties, a bunkruptcy of Iceland for godsakes  so to claim it was primarily caused by the government forcing loans to poor homeowners is a load of nonsense).  Ultimately, the Meltdown was about a lot of financial firms making really dumb decisions and counting on someone else to be holding the property or mortgage when it finally went south so they all took a ton of risks and the world paid for it.  And actually, Sec. of the Treasury Henry Paulson was terrific during this time, piecing together stop-gap solutions to keep things from being a catastrophe.  But it happened on Bush's watch (and when that happens, the President always gets some blame).  His speech to the nation about why Paulson's actions were necessary was limp and half-hearted.

Liberals think of Thomas more as an Uncle Tom than a “real black” man. Bush HW just went with the flow, appointing a black person, but one conservatives preferred.

Reagan’s policies were the ones that brought the Cold War to a successful conclusion. It didn’t happen until after he’d left office—Bush had already been President for 10 months when the Berlin Wall fell—but the policies that made it happen were Reagan’s, along with those of our allies in Europe.

What is true us: 1- Communists are always lying and 2- I don't like any Communists. At least try to be an adult,"Second, some people will oppose a President purely for party affiliation and will do so passionately.  Thus, whether it's a democrat or republican in office, there will be some people who hate that individually passionately (mostly b/c of political positions though sometimes it gets tied in to other factors...JFK faced some opposition b/c he was Catholic, a lot of people hate Obama b/c he's perceived as ""un-American"" which gets in to some race issues).  But basically, some dislike is due to partisan issues.  Now,  President Bush gets some extra partisan dislike b/c of the 2004 election with it being decided in the Supreme Court rulings and with so many voters being denied the right to vote in Ohio (which then led to early voting options in Ohio in 2004).  And finally, Karl Rove took a particularly unique approach in the 2004 election.  In previous elections, Presidents (regardless of their party) moved to the center.  The idea was to capture as many independents and centrists as possible.  This led to the public complaint you often heard that it didn't matter who you elected, they all held the same positions.  But in 2003, Rove concluded that the best way for George Bush to get elected was to maximize turnout of the Republican base--and he was right.  So George W. Bush campaigned further to the right than a traditional Republican Presidential candidate, sought to focus his appeal to more traditional GOP right-wing base groups (like evangelicals).  And he did so at the expense of appealing to centrists and independents and moderates.",0

What is true us: 1- Communists are always lying and 2- I don't like any Communists. At least try to be an adult,"Third, George W. Bush's push for ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" is something that was a huge issue for a small part of the US population but it constituted a moral transgression for those Americans, an action that they felt was inconsistent with our values as a Nation.  Don't get me wrong, the USA isn't pure, we've done bad stuff in the past.  But to officially say ""we torture"" (or more specifically ""we do stuff that other people insist is torture but we're doing to do it and not calling it torture"") was a break for this group of people.  It was something that made it impossible for them to support or approve of the Bush administration regardless of their politics (and no, they weren't mostly liberal or democrat...often times they were religious-based groups or individuals who felt this was immoral).",0

What is true us: 1- Communists are always lying and 2- I don't like any Communists. At least try to be an adult,"Fourth, the Bush Administration didn't deal very effectively with three major symbolic events and they became albatrosses around the neck of President Bush:
--Katrina.  Every President has natural disasters.  There is a limit to what you can plan for them.  FEMA, even when they do a good job, becomes a punching bag (b/c the local government doesn't want to step up and say ""yep, we sucked on this one""....it's easier to blame the Feds for getting in the way or not keeping promises or whatever).  But Bush's appointment of Michael Brown and then ""you're doing a heckuva job Brownie"" were really hard to live down for the Administration.  The last President to have such a poorly managed natural disaster was probably Pres. George HW Bush with Hurricane Andrew.
--Iraq.  Despite the success of the surge, there are many people who believe (as I do), that the invasion of Iraq will go down in history as one of the worst foreign policy decisions ever made by a US President.  It will, I believe, be shown to have contributed to destabilizing that region by enabling a pan-Islamist movement.  It's just really really hard to argue Iraq is a positive action.  And if you think I'm wrong on this, just look at the heat that Jeb Bush is taking right now for basically trying not to criticize his brother on this decision--even heat from other Republicans.
--Financial Meltdown of 2007-8.  The Bush Administration didn't really contribute much to WHY this happened (contrary to efforts by a range of partisans, the policies of both the Clinton or Bush administrations weren't major contributors to the meltdowns... you saw collapses of financial firms that held no residential properties, a bunkruptcy of Iceland for godsakes  so to claim it was primarily caused by the government forcing loans to poor homeowners is a load of nonsense).  Ultimately, the Meltdown was about a lot of financial firms making really dumb decisions and counting on someone else to be holding the property or mortgage when it finally went south so they all took a ton of risks and the world paid for it.  And actually, Sec. of the Treasury Henry Paulson was terrific during this time, piecing together stop-gap solutions to keep things from being a catastrophe.  But it happened on Bush's watch (and when that happens, the President always gets some blame).  His speech to the nation about why Paulson's actions were necessary was limp and half-hearted.  At a time when the nation needed vigorous leadership and a visible President, our visible leader was Henry Paulson.",0

1447614763370942476,ellen degeneres is a domestic terrorist,"Shockingly, it seems that DeGeneres might not always practice what she preaches: crew members on her talkshow are reportedly furious over the not-so-kind way they’ve been treated during the coronavirus crisis. According to Variety, the core stage crew for the Ellen DeGeneres Show are frustrated that they haven’t received written communication about the status of their hours or pay. They were also less than thrilled to discover, via social media, that an outside, non-union, tech company had been hired to help DeGeneres film her show remotely from her home. This stung as DeGeneres had recently announced on-air that she wanted to start filming again as soon as possible so she could support her staff and crew.",0
1447614763370942476,ellen degeneres is a domestic terrorist,"DeGeneres isn’t personally responsible for every aspect of how her show is run, of course. But it certainly seems like a woman who is reportedly worth more than $330m and is one of the highest-paid stars on television, earning more than $50m a year, could be doing rather more to support the people who work under her. Particularly as many of her crew have worked on the show since it started 17 years ago. It’s worth noting that Jimmy Kimmel Live! stagehands, according to Variety, were paid from Kimmel’s own pocket during initial coronavirus shutdowns.",0
1447614763370942476,ellen degeneres is a domestic terrorist,"This isn’t exactly the first time that DeGeneres’s public persona has appeared to be at odds with her private actions. There have been rumors floating around for years that the 62-year-old comedian is – to quote a viral Twitter thread on the subject – “one of the meanest people alive”. Recently, however, anti-Ellen sentiment appears to have reached new heights. A couple of weeks ago she was slammed for comparing self-quarantining in her multimillion-dollar mansion to “being in jail”, for example. And Nikkie de Jager, a Dutch YouTube star who goes by the name NikkieTutorials, has been in the headlines this week after sharing her unpleasant experience on the Ellen show. De Jager told Dutch magazine &C that she wasn’t allowed to use the toilet nearest her on the show because it “was reserved for the Jonas brothers” and that DeGeneres was “cold and distant” when the cameras weren’t rolling. “I was expecting [the experience to be like] a Disney show, but got Teletubbies after dark.”",0
1447614763370942476,ellen degeneres is a domestic terrorist,"Why is DeGeneres suddenly getting so much backlash and bad press? Well, for one thing, coronavirus has made us all sick to death of celebrity shenanigans. It’s hard for stars to seem relatable when they’re moaning about their mansions.",0
1447614763370942476,ellen degeneres is a domestic terrorist,"More broadly, however, I think some of the animosity towards DeGeneres has to do with the way she exemplifies the hypocrisy around the concept of “civility”. Last year, for example, DeGeneres lectured us all on her friendship with George W Bush, a man who opposed same-sex marriage and whose own former counter-terrorism chief accused him of committing war crimes. “When I say, ‘Be kind to one another’, I don’t mean only the people who think the same way that you do,” DeGeneres said on her show, in response to criticism of her hobnobbing with Bush. “I mean be kind to everyone. Doesn’t matter.”",0
1447614763370942476,ellen degeneres is a domestic terrorist,"Actually, it’s a little bit more complicated than that. The notion of civility has been weaponized to shut down criticism and stop people from pointing out uncomfortable facts. It seems to be considered more unacceptable, in some parts of the media, to call someone a racist than to actually be a racist. It seems to be considered more unacceptable to criticize someone for hanging out with a war criminal than actually being a war criminal. “Be kind!” the 1% keep telling us, “don’t you dare be critical!”",0

It’s hard to overstate how brave it was for her to come out in 1997; her courage made life a lot easier for the next generation of queer people. According to a 2015 poll, Ellen did more to influence Americans’ attitudes about gay rights than any other celebrity or public figure.

He’s posted in threads like “N----r hate thread #1,” “The K-ke Hate Thread,” “Juno comes out as a tranny,” and “OFFICIAL Post-Election Voter Fraud THREAD,” where he called Joe Biden “a pedophile retard who’s about to die in the oval office.” Elsewhere he’s derided the Covid-19 vaccine, which he calls “gook juice” and “chinky jew sauce.” Last year he revealed his Twitter account, @ApevonTarskin. The username matches a commenter on Thought Catalog, which ToxicCisWhiteMaleFat has said he trolled after it retracted a transphobic essay by Proud Boys founder Gavin McInnes. His contributions there were more of the same. Under a 2015 post titled “When You Love ‘The Chase,’” he once commented, “There is not a more despicable human on this earth than a fat white n----r fucker. Get an AIDS test. You have it.” The internet can sometimes seem like one big rabbit hole, and if you make it down to the bottom, waiting for you is a person. At the bottom of mine was ToxicCisWhiteMaleFat.",0

But what won’t change is this: the cesspool of elites, many of them in New York, who allowed Jeffrey Epstein to flourish with impunity. For decades, important, influential, “serious” people attended Epstein’s dinner parties, rode his private jet, and furthered the fiction that he was some kind of genius hedge-fund billionaire. How do we explain why they looked the other way, or flattered Epstein, even as they must have noticed he was often in the company of a young harem? Easy: They got something in exchange from him, whether it was a free ride on that airborne “Lolita Express,” some other form of monetary largesse, entrée into the extravagant celebrity soirées he hosted at his townhouse, or, possibly and harrowingly, a pound or two of female flesh.",0

Admittedly, he is not as ‘great’ as many of his fans like to paint him as: his pre-WW2 career is thoroughly mediocre, especially on the military front, and had he died before the Second World War he’d be considered a deeply unremarkable politician today. His Second World War career however is certainly impressive, viewed from the angle of competence and political value alone: although again not flawless. He contributed in no small part to the tenacious British fighting spirit of the Second World War and his political maneuvering throughout the war certainly was savvy enough, and for that he ought to be credited.",0

The IRA was ruthless and still is. It only agreed to a peace process, which it has broken time and again, because Sinn Fein demanded that all IRA terrorists be given “comfort letters” by Blair and Clinton so they could not be prosecuted for their vile atrocities.

 * He never had sex with her
 * He couldn’t have bought her a drink in the club because he doesn’t know where the bar is (hint- it’s usually not particularly hard to find the bar in a club, they’re literally designed so even drunk people can do it)
 * This photo is obviously photoshopped because he isn’t wearing a tie (which he always does when going out in London, apart from in the many many other photos the press have dredged up of him not wearing a tie):
 * He couldn’t possibly have been in the club on the night in question because he was at a pizza restaurant 5 hours before
 * Her account is wrong because he doesn’t sweat
 * He only travelled to New York and stayed with Jeffrey Epstein for 4 nights after Epstein was convicted as a paedophile because he wanted to tell him that their friendship was over
 * He never suspected anything amiss about the many very young women wandering around his convicted paedophile friends house whilst he was there
 * He couldn’t just have phoned him to ‘break up’ their friendship because he was ‘too honourable’.
Even if you take him at his word for all of that, you are still left with the fact that Prince Andrew chose to maintain a relationship with a convicted paedophile, lied about it and even stayed at his house and attended dinner parties with him.

Given the writer’s anonymity, The New Republic is unable to definitively confirm or refute these claims. Nonetheless, it’s clear that the “mole” referenced as a source in the latter half of this article can no longer be trusted, nor can the suggested links between Italia and the forum user. We regret the error. In the dark recesses of the internet lurks a man who goes by ToxicCisWhiteMaleFat. He makes his home on onaforums.net, a community named after the shock jock duo Opie & Anthony—a safe space to say what cannot be said offline. He’s posted in threads like “N----r hate thread #1,” “The K-ke Hate Thread,” “Juno comes out as a tranny,” and “OFFICIAL Post-Election Voter Fraud THREAD,” where he called Joe Biden “a pedophile retard who’s about to die in the oval office.” Elsewhere he’s derided the Covid-19 vaccine, which he calls “gook juice” and “chinky jew sauce.” Last year he revealed his Twitter account, @ApevonTarskin. The username matches a commenter on Thought Catalog, which ToxicCisWhiteMaleFat has said he trolled after it retracted a transphobic essay by Proud Boys founder Gavin McInnes. His contributions there were more of the same. Under a 2015 post titled “When You Love ‘The Chase,’” he once commented, “There is not a more despicable human on this earth than a fat white n----r fucker. Get an AIDS test. You have it.” The internet can sometimes seem like one big rabbit hole, and if you make it down to the bottom, waiting for you is a person. At the bottom of mine was ToxicCisWhiteMaleFat.",0

This work has periodically brought me in contact with some of the leading lights in the scene’s transgressive edge—the place where popular, mainstream comedy bleeds into the kind of right-wing politics that animated the Capitol riot last month. It’s a place hostile to prying eyes, and the blowback can be furious. I have been harassed and trolled on social media. I have been doxxed, as have members of my family. And eventually, I found my way to a message board where ToxicCisWhiteMaleFat—who I have reason to believe, though I cannot definitively prove, is a person at the heart of the New York City club comedy scene—and others participated in the Gamergate-style campaign that had been conducted against me. This online forum—just one node in a constellation of similar forums, subreddits, and Discord groups—is not some outlier in the industry. Before I take you down my particular rabbit hole, it’s worth establishing the many ways in which the worlds of comedy and the racist right overlap and reinforce each other.",0
1447535337576747008,"Wow, Ann Coulter is a Vax Nazi now? What a strange world this has become","The recent comedy boom is popularly understood as an era in which new forms of media, like podcasts and streaming video, created massive new audiences for comedy, which in turn created massive new revenue streams for comedians. At the same time, the artificial intimacy of these platforms allowed fans to feel a level of connection with their favorite performers—and with each other—that could verge on the cultish. This was not simply an era of glorious bounty, in which little-known comedians could land massive Netflix paydays or leapfrog from UCB Comedy to College Humor to lucrative sitcom writing gigs. It was also the era of walled-off subcultures, like onaforums.net, which could transform into real, violent political factions, especially at a time when comedy was increasingly pitted against the forces of political correctness—the very forces that also fueled the grievances of Donald Trump’s supporters and the revanchist right, whose credo of “owning the libs” reads a lot like the traditional comedian’s defense of his right to insult and offend. The mobs that descended on Washington, D.C., last month have intellectual roots in many places, going back to the bloody beginnings of this country. But they also have roots in specific areas of modern culture, including Facebook, BuzzFeed, and the increasingly online world of comedy. All the forces that incubated the rioters are still there, unchanged, chugging along as normal. The rot goes much deeper than you might expect. If the far right’s origins in comedy are ill-appreciated, they were never particularly secret. By his own account, Gavin McInnes created the Proud Boys on Compound Media, a subscriber-based digital network where he hosted a talk show from 2015 to 2017. Originally called the Anthony Cumia Network, Compound Media was created in 2014 by Cumia—the “Anthony” half of Opie & Anthony—after his firing from SiriusXM over a series of racist tweets.",0
1447535337576747008,"Wow, Ann Coulter is a Vax Nazi now? What a strange world this has become","The credo of “owning the libs” reads a lot like the traditional comedian’s defense of his right to insult and offend. When McInnes founded the Proud Boys in 2016, he used TGMS as a recruitment tool. In his monologue and call-in segments, he laid out the organization’s principles and customs, chief among which was its ideology of Western chauvinism: a belief in the superiority of Western civilization and the white people supposedly responsible for it. “White males are a big part of what made the West great,” he told a caller with questions about joining. “The Black contingent [of the Proud Boys] is pro-white male, the same you would be if you were an expat living in Japan—you’d be pro-Japanese and you’d take your shoes off.” Despite his concerns that the openly Nazi elements of the far right were bad for his brand, McInnes didn’t hesitate to associate with them. His guests were a who’s who of the contemporary far right: Milo Yiannopoulos, Richard Spencer, Unite the Right rally organizer Jason Kessler, “Crying Nazi” Christopher Cantwell, Mike Cernovich, Sal Cipolla, Faith Goldy, Roosh V, even former KKK leader David Duke. The Gavin McInnes Show was more than the white power hour, however. In the years before and during his show on Compound Media, McInnes tried his hand at live comedy, performing in New York City venues like the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater and The Creek and The Cave. He recorded a podcast, “Free Speech,” at the club Stand Up NY; in 2016, McInnes said he was banned from a club called The Stand after he exposed himself onstage. (He later recalled the manager telling him, “I have to turn my back on you now.”) He used his platform on Compound Media to mingle with a revolving door of respected, even mainstream comics: people like Big Jay Oakerson, Tim Dillon, Justy Dodge, Mike Lawrence, Larry the Cable Guy, Joe Matarese, Tom Shillue, Dave Hill, Alonzo Bodden, Luis Gomez, and Dave Smith, none of whom were deterred by McInnes’s friendliness with white supremacists. Some stopped by for a one-off appearance. Others were repeats, like Gomez and Smith, who hosted their own Compound Media show, Legion of Skanks, with Oakerson. Gomez laid out McInnes’s influence quite explicitly in 2016. “The reason I love Gavin is because he has said n----r and faggot so much that that’s not even a big deal,” he said. “When you come to watch the Legion of Skanks show, you should be hearing racist, sexist, offensive shit. If you’re upset about that, don’t watch the show.”",0
1447535337576747008,"Wow, Ann Coulter is a Vax Nazi now? What a strange world this has become","In retrospect, The Gavin McInnes Show’s function was not just to introduce the comedy world to the Nazi world but to let one legitimize the other. At this, McInnes was wildly successful, his influence long outlasting his own tenure in the New York comedy scene. In 2017, Dave Smith used a TGMS guest-hosting spot to interview Richard Spencer and Christopher Cantwell, giving both a friendly platform to lay out their vision for a white ethnostate. By then, he and the other two Legion of Skanks members had left Compound Media for a network co-founded by Gomez, GaS Digital, where they carried on the TGMS tradition: racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, and flirtation with the far right. Today Legion of Skanks holds considerable sway in comedy, with a massive platform it’s lent everyone who’s anyone in the New York club scene—while remaining true to its far-right roots. In 2019, it hosted Milo Yiannopoulos after his fall from grace. In 2018, Gomez angrily chased a fan out of a recording when the man pointed out a Proud Boy in the audience. Smith, a Nazi sympathizer who believes Jews run “forces that are killing the society,” has become a powerful voice in the right flank of the Libertarian Party. He’s used his own podcast on GaS Digital to pal around with white supremacists like Cantwell, Spencer, and Nick Fuentes. “If I can use the government to do horrific things to [the left], I will, because they’ve been doing horrific things to us for centuries,” Cantwell told him after the Unite the Right rally in 2017. Smith agreed: “It’s almost like you’re having a conversation with somebody, and they punch you in the face … the only logical response is to get up and fight.” Would extremism have found such a loving home in comedy without McInnes? Maybe. Much of the blame also goes to the man who gave him a platform during the alt-right’s formative years: Anthony Cumia. A racist Trump supporter who pleaded guilty to domestic abuse charges in 2016, Cumia certainly shares much of McInnes’s ideology. He’s spent six years mingling with reactionaries like Ann Coulter, Alex Jones, and Donald Trump Jr. on Compound Media’s marquee program, The Anthony Cumia Show with Dave Landau. The network as a whole straddles the same worlds as TGMS: On one side, it is a breeding ground for far-right ideology, on the other a regular old gig for pretty much every club comic in New York City. In some cases, the line is completely blurred. Compound host Chrissie Mayr has lately delved deep into QAnon conspiracy theories—believing and spreading them, that is—and attended the protests at Capitol Hill on January 6. Aaron Berg and Geno Bisconte host In Hot Water, a show whose recurring segments include “Black Guy of the Day,” “ISIS Faggot,” and “Rape of the Day.” These comics are all regulars at New York City clubs like The Stand, Gotham Comedy Club, and New York Comedy Club, and at venues around the country. It’s unlikely many bookers know they built their followings on a network that caters to the far right.",0
1447535337576747008,"Wow, Ann Coulter is a Vax Nazi now? What a strange world this has become","Anthony Cumia’s influence goes far beyond the people and ideas he platforms. It’s also in the people he inspires, like Christopher Cantwell, an Opie & Anthony fan who tested his mettle in the open mic circuit before finding his voice in neo-Nazi broadcasting. Another acolyte is a man named Patrick Milligan. In the early 2000s, Milligan launched a website honoring Opie & Anthony. He called it Cringe Humor, using it initially as a repository for news, reviews, and opinion pieces about the comedy community. As the site grew, he began producing shows around New York City with his favorite comics, like Opie & Anthony regulars Rich Vos and Jim Florentine. In 2005, he partnered with a group of fellow comedy lovers—Cris Italia, the editor of a vaccine-skeptic magazine; his brother, Paul Italia, a real estate agent; and later Dave Kimowitz, a talent manager—to transform Cringe Humor into a production and management firm, signing club stalwart Dante Nero as their first client. Their mission was to promote the “cringe” style of comedy. What was cringe? Milligan defined the genre early on as “comedy that would offend many close minded individuals,” and its practitioners as “comedians who aren’t afraid to tackle subjects many ‘safe’ performers won’t touch.” As Kimowitz later described it, “We were the original rape joke people.” These are euphemisms, of course. Cringe means angry and aggrieved, hateful and bigoted. Milligan’s list of “awful comedians” included the categories “Ethnic Garbage,” “Racial Garbage,” and “Female.” (Misogyny was a running theme: In a 2007 blog post titled “Here’s to you, Slutty Female Comedians!” he wrote, “Who cares if you are funny? Odds are you are not. That’s why the good Lord gave you breasts, an ass and a vagina, and most of all a mouth.”)",0
1447535337576747008,"Wow, Ann Coulter is a Vax Nazi now? What a strange world this has become","Milligan’s list of “awful comedians” included the categories “Ethnic Garbage,” “Racial Garbage,” and “Female.” The firm’s lineups in those early days featured comics like Jim Norton, Robert Kelly, Bill Burr, Louis CK, Joe DeRosa, and Mike DeStefano, all known for their brash sensibilities and hostility to political correctness. (These are also euphemisms.) Many were Opie & Anthony regulars, fitting in with Cringe Humor’s mission to bring old-school Opie & Anthony humor into the twenty-first century. That mission was a success. Over the course of the late 2000s and early 2010s, the firm’s live productions leveled up from bars to clubs to colleges to theaters. In 2012 they opened their own club and restaurant in Gramercy Park, The Stand, hoping to offer a more hospitable atmosphere than the traditional club. A few years later, they opened a satellite location in Long Island City, then moved the main club to a bigger space in Union Square. They signed Big Jay Oakerson and co-produced his Comedy Central special. They produced Conan writer Laurie Kilmartin’s special on streaming service Seeso. They signed Luis Gomez, Aaron Berg, Yannis Pappas, a pre–Saturday Night Live Pete Davidson, Cash Cab host Ben Bailey. When a Queens venue called The Creek and the Cave asked the Legion of Skanks not to host Milo Yiannopoulos in 2019, the group relocated its weekly recording to The Stand. Later that year, the club booked Shane Gillis for his first performance after SNL fired him over a series of racist and homophobic statements on his podcast. (Disclosure: A tipster sent me the clip that set off this news cycle.) This past fall, the club boasted that SNL hosts Bill Burr and Dave Chappelle used it to workshop their monologues (Chappelle’s publicist confirmed that he tested his material at The Stand and other clubs). The show celebrated Chappelle’s election-week episode with an indoor afterparty at the club. It took almost two decades, but the men behind Cringe Humor successfully grew an Opie & Anthony fan forum into a major New York City comedy club. But it was not just any comedy club. The Stand, it must be said, is the product of a concerted effort to create a space in American culture for the school of comedy embodied by Anthony Cumia. Its longtime booker is Patrick Milligan.",0
1447535337576747008,"Wow, Ann Coulter is a Vax Nazi now? What a strange world this has become","We have almost reached the bottom of the rabbit hole. To get there, I must return to my own story. In June, I observed on Twitter that many right-leaning comics like Dave Smith associate with The Stand. A few days later, I found myself on the receiving end of belligerent tweets from the club’s Twitter account, partly operated by Milligan and Cris Italia, calling me fake news. Italia parked himself in my mentions during the coming months to deliver the same message, eventually declaring that he was deliberately trolling me so I would spend less time bothering comedians. This struck me as unusual behavior but certainly not out of line with the belligerence I’ve come to expect from comedy industry figures unaccustomed to outside scrutiny. In October, I emailed Italia for comment on a story. The Stand had just hosted an indoor Legion of Skanks recording, featuring Anthony Cumia and Aaron Berg, apparently in violation of New York’s Covid-19 restrictions. As is customary, I wanted to include the club’s side. Instead of answering my questions, Italia posted one of my emails on Twitter. What happened next was a familiar experience: waves of angry replies from comedy fans defending the honor of Cumia, Berg, and the Legion of Skanks. Then something new happened. A few days later—before I published the story—I discerned from my mentions that a user on onaforums.net had doxxed me in retaliation for my reporting on Cumia. They didn’t stop with me. Over a period of weeks, the user, SpaceEdge, doxxed my entire family; harassed me, my parents, and my brother by text and phone; doxxed and harassed several of my Twitter followers; and doxxed a man they believed to be my landlord. (I’m using the singular “they” to refer to SpaceEdge both because I don’t know their gender and I cannot know whether the onslaught of texts and calls originated from one person or several.) As I pored over the forum trying to understand what was going on, I discovered this was a routine pastime for its members. Using tactics honed by right-wing extremists during the GamerGate movement—an online harassment campaign fueled in part by reactionary ideology—the forum’s users have targeted a science fiction author and his wife, comedians they don’t like, and even Brianna Wu, one of the original targets of GamerGate. In my case, a user who went by Anthony and had the bio @CompoundBoss stopped by at one point to cheer them on. “Those text messages you sent to that little queer really made me laugh hard,” he wrote. “If that sissy faggot kills himself, you’d make a lot of people happy including myself. Keep up the good work fellas.” Meanwhile on Twitter, Cris Italia and his co-owners openly relished the harassment campaign. “You caused this,” he tweeted. “You are to blame for your family getting doxxed.”",0
1447535337576747008,"Wow, Ann Coulter is a Vax Nazi now? What a strange world this has become","The harassment died down by the end of November, when I received an email from a mole within the forum. They described themselves as an Opie fan sick of the racist Anthony fans tarnishing Opie’s legacy. They sent me screenshots from private internal message boards for power users, where people occasionally let slip their offline identities. One such user went by ToxicCisWhiteMaleFat. In private chatrooms inaccessible to the general public, this user described himself as a man named Cris who was associated with a comedy club called The Stand. In two separate posts, he claimed to have written this Medium essay Cris Italia wrote about me in October, titled “Seth Simons is Not a Journalist.” In one post on the message board, he wrote, “the lockdown cumio [Cuomo] is talking about would end the stand, would end restaurants and many would never come back.” He added, “With any luck I will be able to afford a taco cart, or a shitty food truck like jon favreau in Chef.” (Interesting.) Elsewhere, he suggested I snuck into The Stand after Shane Gillis’s firing from SNL. I didn’t, but Italia implied I did. This all seemed too neat a plot twist, so I emailed Italia asking if he’s ever used the forum. He said no and accused me of trying to smear him. The next day my mole informed me the forum’s moderators had kicked newer members out of the private boards, where ToxicCisWhiteMaleFat was questioning how I figured him out. A day later, I emailed Italia asking specifically about the username. He said he had no idea what I was talking about. Another day later, the entire website went down. When it returned, the previous three days of posts were gone. In the private channel, users were panicking about potential legal scrutiny. One said he couldn’t afford to get extradited to Israel. Another said he would make a few calls telling friends to lay low. Then he praised ToxicCisWhiteMaleFat: “You’ve been one of the more genuine guys I’ve met and have never scumbagged a comic as so many other bookers around this dumb country have,” he wrote. “Whoever’s the snitch 100% deserves to be taken on a boat ride and shot in the face.” “Thanks buddy,” ToxicCisWhiteMaleFat responded. “Hopefully we can get you for more spots (if we’re still in business next week).”",0
1447535337576747008,"Wow, Ann Coulter is a Vax Nazi now? What a strange world this has become","When I emailed Italia screenshots of these posts, he said he’d sue me if I ever connected him to them. Then, in several long paragraphs he declared off the record—a stipulation to which I did not agree—he said someone must be impersonating him. He doesn’t have time to post that much, he continued, and having grown up in pre-gentrification Bushwick he would never use the sort of language ToxicCisWhiteMaleFat uses. He advised me to let it go. T.J. Miller, the comedian who has been thoroughly disgraced by allegations of sexual assault and transphobia but is somehow still at it, recently made an apt observation about how power works in mass culture. “Standups understand this: If you empower your audience, they’re much more likely to pay you again to support you,” he told comedian Bobby Lee. “The audience wants to be empowered.” He was critiquing Hollywood’s reliance on stale film franchises he believes audiences don’t like, but the analysis applies to comedy, too. You empower an audience by giving them what they want. The power they give you in return is their trust, their loyalty, their willingness to fight for you. The relationship between an entertainer and his audience isn’t all that different from the one between a political leader and his movement. It’s easy to lose sight of a simple truth: Things are the way they are because people made them so. The far right did not come into being by chance. People shaped it. They went where they thought they could win people over, and they won people over. They offered permission to revel in racism and sexism, in homophobia and transphobia, and they earned devoted followings in return. They couldn’t do this alone, though. They had to be let in. Donald Trump is out of office. Gavin McInnes officially left the Proud Boys years ago. ToxicCisWhiteMaleFat deleted his username a few weeks ago (his posts remain, albeit attributed to “Guest”), announcing his new alias, “Don Sterling,” in the private channel. The far right has splintered into factions with varying ideologies and goals, each preparing for a new era of post-Trump violence. The people who gave this movement a constituency in comedy—who masked it in the language of free speech, who hid it behind the shield of more respectable artists—are all still in charge of their little fiefdoms.

All this because DeSantis is afraid that if he supports vaccination and the wearing of masks, Donald Trump will turn on him and his “base"" won't vote for him next year. It does not seem to occur to either of them that they are killing that very same base by not insisting on vaccinations and the wearing of masks indoors. If this continues, the majority of the surviving voters will be democrats and independents and he won't have enough of his base left alive or healthy enough to get to the polls to vote for him. Sacrificing the lives of people for a political position of any kind is even more evil than if they took a fully automatic AK-47 and drove to every church, club, store, football game or other gathering place and started sweeping the crowd with exploding bullets.

2. She claims systemic racism is basically gone from our society and yet she hides the fact that the NAACP helped her win a lawsuit as a young lady when she was discriminated against due to her race. I think she even peddles negative right wing talking points regarding the NAACP now. She's a grifter. [1] [2]
3. She claims that the Nazis were not nationalists and that their real problem was that they were globalists. Nevermind the ethnic cleansing. This is your brain on the alt right. [3]
4. She headed an astroturf and frankly racist campaign called Blexit, which borrows it's name from the Brexit movement. The idea was to try to get black Americans to “leave the Democratic plantation""; which implies black people have no agency and are easily led. To top things off, the slogan for Blexit was literally “We Free"". And nothing says you respect the intelligence of black people like recruiting Kanye West to try to market politics to them.
5. Her career in conservative punditry started when Turning Points USA (a conservative college outreach organization) needed to hire a person of color to try to make up for the bad PR of constantly having leading members being exposed as white supremacists. I kid you not. Prior to that, she was actually a liberal commentator. Again, I kid you not. I wonder what cau$ed her to $o $uddenly take a 180 on her political $tance$? [4]
6. No surprise that she's also a climate denier. Or maybe it's more accurate to call these folks scientifically ignorant. [5]
So, what do we think of her? She's a dishonest hack who is clever in peddling her BS and makes a lot of money by giving right wingers a cover for the rhetoric and policy they push that harms black people. I'm going to let my man, Korey sum it up:",0

You're both moving to Texas to avoid taxes on your unearned wealth? So relatable.,"Love her or hate her, you've got to give Kim Kardashian West some credit. According to Forbes, the reality TV star, 40, saw her net worth soar to $1bn this month, due mainly to the success of her shapewear brand Skims, and the cosmetics company KKW Beauty. In addition to numerous endorsement deals made off the back of her reality show, Keeping Up With the Kardashians, which is now in its 20th and final season, Kardashian ventured out on her own in 2017 with KKW Beauty, after watching her sister Kylie Jenner's overnight success with Kylie Cosmetics. A billionaire in her own right, Jenner sold a majority stake to beauty giant Coty for $600 million in 2019, while Kardasian is reported to have sold 20% of KKW to Coty last year, who valued the company at $1 billion. You may be wondering what Kim Kardashian has got to do with you. But, I would argue that, indirectly, she's had a quiet influence on how you look, without you even knowing it. I've been writing about health and beauty for 25 years. I've seen most trends come around at least a dozen times. But I've never seen such a lasting impact as the one made by the Kardashians. Before Kim came onto the small screen in 2007, the ideal body image was thin and shapeless. We were in the thick of a shocking size zero era, spearheaded by the Zoe-bots, Nicole Ritchie, Lindsay Lohan, Mischa Barton, then style disciples of super stylist, Rachel Zoe. Zoe took young Hollywood under her wing and transformed their fluffy Californian style into a high fashion affair. She teamed their super svelte frames with oversized handbags and giant sunglasses, which only emphasized how slim these girls actually were. Whether they were naturally thin or not, there wasn't much else to aspire to.",1

In 2016, Forbes estimated her net worth at $51 million. 2. She’s also the focal point of the longest-running reality TV show in history. That’s right – Keeping Up With The Kardashians will have been on our screens for a decade this October. 3. And she works hard on it. She often shoots for 10 to 12 hours a day – more, if there's a particularly big storyline. 4. Plus, since the show first aired, E! has broadcast over 200,000 total minutes of KUWTK. Enough footage has been captured to show the programme for 24 hours for 150 days. 5. And Kim’s wedding to Kris Humphries is still responsible for the most-watched day in E!'s programming history. 6. Oh and let’s not forget, she’s also an executive producer on the most successful, longest-running reality show of all time.

She normalised the curvaceous female body at a time when it really wasn’t ""in fashion."" 9. She gave confidence to a whole bunch of women, some of them famous, whose body types had previously been underrepresented. 10. She's also part of a powerful family of creative women, who hustle hard, and their show proves that men come and go, but their relationships remain constant. 11. And she also embraces her body and sexuality – with, for example, nude selfies – in a world which repeatedly tells girls and women that they shouldn’t be proud of either.",1

The Kardashians, particularly Kim, represent what's right with America. Kim Kardashian is a bona fide, true, and real entrepreneur. Her many businesses have created jobs, opportunities, wealth, and entertainment for millions of people. Her professional activities have raised awareness for issues ranging from female entrepreneurism to substance abuse to gender identity. She is a smart businesswoman that we can all learn from.

Before becoming famous, she worked at her father's music-marketing firm, then at a clothing store for four years. She ran her own successful eBay business, buying and selling designer clothing, and another successful closet-organizing business, catering to both celebrities and non-celebrities. Of course, she came from a wealthy family (her father was a well-known L.A. lawyer who famously represented O.J. Simpson in his murder trial). But her father, who helped finance her earliest entrepreneurial activities, insisted on being paid back with interest. ""Our dad used to say, 'Nothing in life is for free, you girls aren't going to get just whatever you want,'"" according to Kim and her sisters in their autobiography. Their parents made it ""very clear"" that they would be totally cut off after they finished school. ""So we all learned early on if you want money, you have to earn it."" And earn it she did.",1

Kim Kardashian earned $28 million last year and was considered one of Time's most influential people in 2014. Her mobile app generates hundreds of millions of dollars. She has a chain of stores and earns millions from endorsements. And here's the thing: All of this essentially came from a sex tape! Once some level of minor celebrity status was achieved, Kardashian, like any smart entrepreneur, took risk after risk. She invented and then reinvented her image. She revealed her most private details on a reality TV show and continues to endure the withering abuse from many (like that angry NPR listener) who detest her kind of entrepreneurism. She is as brave as every business owner who makes a living legally selling guns, sex, fatty foods, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and law services. Who are we to judge what someone does for a living? The world's greatest entrepreneurs, inventors, and artists have also been the target of similar criticisms and abuse from society, only to overcome that and succeed with their missions. That's what Kim Kardashian is doing.",1

She gets flooded with deals and offers every week but only chooses those that will make the best use of her name. She appears at fashion shows, is photographed at celebrity parties, and then sits down to talk business and technology with the likes of Kara Swisher at serious tech conferences. She has turned both her marriages and her pregnancies into national media events. She and her sisters wear the latest fashions, the nicest jewelry, and vacation at the most fantastic spots because it tells her audience, her customers, and her fans that they can be just like her. Just keep watching her show and buying her products. Everything Kim Kardashian does is about keeping her and her family relevant and her brand fresh and innovative.

In a world where many of my family-run business clients are struggling to get along with each other, Kim has found a way of getting her entire, extended family to benefit from the success that she created. This empire has enabled her mother, sisters, and stepfamily members to also earn millions doing everything from appearing at events to launching their own modeling careers. Through her, we've learned that we're not the only ones who argue with our siblings, struggle with financial challenges, and endure all those typical family business problems. We've seen her share her wealth and encourage others in her family to succeed. But don't forget...like any good senior manager, Kim is always there, keeping a wary eye out to make sure that whatever her family members are doing is contributing in some way to the Kardashian brand and fortune.",1

Great entrepreneurs like Kardashian are of course focused on making money. But then it goes beyond that. On one episode of KUPWTK (and yes, I watch the show--it's awesome and impossible to turn off the TV once it starts), a crying, heavyset woman came backstage at an event to thank Kim's beautiful but also heavyset sister Khloe for being an inspiration to women like her. We all know that Kim is proud of her larger-than-life derriere. So through those famous photo shoots and magazine covers she is telling women to be proud of theirs too. Through their business activities, Kim and her sisters have given women more reasons to be confident about themselves. And their show has given others in their family, particularly their stepdad, the opportunity to raise awareness about issues like gender equality. This all began and continues with Kim.",1

Teenage boys lust for her in a way that few women in this generation have managed. Most actresses, singers and models can be pretty polarizing, but Kim Kardashian gets high approval among boys of all races. 
 
Teenage girls like her because she dates a lot of famous men (Reggie Bush, Kanye West, Kris Humphries, and Ray J), is very popular, is attractive, and doesn't have to do anything to increase her fame and wealth other than be herself in front of cameras. 
 
The fact that she doesn't really have any talent works to her advantage. An actress can fall from the spotlight after a few movies bomb. Singers can have one bad album or one bad performance on SNL and their fan base gets sick of them. Kim Kardashian doesn't have anything to screw up.

1446709351725424646,Ellen Degeneres is a racist POS & I just need everyone to know that.,"Ellen DeGeneres has built her worldwide, multimillion-dollar brand on the motto “be kind,” with lavish giveaways and acts of charity. But behind the scenes, current and former employees on her leading daytime show say they faced racism, fear, and intimidation. “That ‘be kind’ bullshit only happens when the cameras are on. It’s all for show,” one former employee told BuzzFeed News. “I know they give money to people and help them out, but it’s for show.” BuzzFeed News spoke to one current and 10 former employees on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, all of whom asked to remain anonymous, fearing retribution from the award-winning NBC daytime talk show and others in the entertainment industry. They said they were fired after taking medical leave or bereavement days to attend family funerals. One employee, who claims she was fed up with comments about her race, essentially walked off the job. Others said they were also instructed by their direct managers to not speak to DeGeneres if they saw her around the office. Most of the former employees blamed executive producers and other senior managers for the day-to-day toxicity, but one former employee said that, ultimately, it’s Ellen’s name on the show and “she really needs to take more responsibility” for the workplace environment. “If she wants to have her own show and have her name on the show title, she needs to be more involved to see what's going on,” one former employee said. “I think the executive producers surround her and tell her, ‘Things are going great, everybody's happy,’ and she just believes that, but it's her responsibility to go beyond that.” In a joint statement to BuzzFeed News, executive producers Ed Glavin, Mary Connelly, and Andy Lassner said they take the stories of the employees ""very seriously."" ""Over the course of nearly two decades, 3,000 episodes, and employing over 1000 staff members, we have strived to create an open, safe, and inclusive work environment,"" they said. ""We are truly heartbroken and sorry to learn that even one person in our production family has had a negative experience. It’s not who we are and not who we strive to be, and not the mission Ellen has set for us. ""For the record, the day to day responsibility of the Ellen show is completely on us. We take all of this very seriously and we realize, as many in the world are learning, that we need to do better, are committed to do better, and we will do better."" A Black woman who used to work on The Ellen DeGeneres Show told BuzzFeed News she experienced racist comments, actions, and “microaggressions” during her year and a half as an employee. She said when she was hired, a senior-level producer told her and another Black employee, “Oh wow, you both have box braids; I hope we don’t get you confused.” And at a work party, she said, one of the main writers told her, “I’m sorry, I only know the names of the white people who work here,” and other coworkers “awkwardly laughed it off” instead of coming to her defense. When the former employee brought up issues of race and representation on the show and asked producers not to use offensive terms like “spirit animal” in segments, her colleagues called her “the PC police.” When she started to speak up about the discrimination, she said, all of her colleagues distanced themselves from her. “Whenever I brought up an issue to my white male boss, he would bring up some random story about some random Black friend that he had and how they managed to get over stuff,” she said. “He would use his Black friend as some way to say, ‘I understand your struggle.’ But it was all performative bullshit.” After one year at Ellen, she said she asked for a raise after learning another recent hire made double for doing the same job, despite her having worked in the television industry for a decade. Her manager told her “they’d see what they could do,” but months went by and nothing happened, she said.",0
1446709351725424646,Ellen Degeneres is a racist POS & I just need everyone to know that.,"The former employee said she was also called into a meeting with executive producer Ed Glavin, where she was reprimanded for her objections to the term “spirit animal,” asking for a raise, and suggesting employees on the show receive diversity and inclusion training. “He said that I was walking around looking resentful and angry,” she said. After the meeting, she left work for the day and never returned to The Ellen DeGeneres Show. She said she has no plans to ever work in the entertainment industry again. For years, she felt “a fear of speaking out” but is now inspired to share her experience because of recent conversations about race in Hollywood and other workplaces. “I feel like I’m not alone in this,” she said. “We all feel this. We’ve been feeling this way, but I’ve been too afraid to say anything because everyone knows what happens when you say something as a Black person. You’re blacklisted.” The former employee also said her manager from Ellen recently reached out to her amid the Black Lives Matter protests to apologize for not being a better ally. But the former employee said it's too little, too late. “I feel angry about the way I was treated, and I am always going to stand up for Black, Indigenous, Latino, and Asian people, regardless if they’re around,” she said. “I can’t not say anything. I’m not going to stop talking.” We want your help!

There have been rumors for years about DeGeneres being difficult and how many employees feel unhappy. In March, comedian Kevin T. Porter started a Twitter thread asking people to share “the most insane stories you’ve heard about Ellen [DeGeneres] being mean.” The tweet has more than 2,600 replies. In April, Variety reported that employees were “distressed and outraged” by top-level producers who didn’t communicate details about their jobs and pay at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. DeGeneres’s former bodyguard also recently said he had had a negative experience with her at the 2014 Oscars, calling the TV host’s treatment of others “demeaning.” A spokesperson for Warner Bros. Television, which distributes the show, told Variety that the crew was consistently paid during the pandemic, although at reduced hours, and “acknowledged that communication could have been better, but cited complications due to the chaos caused by COVID-19.” A current employee told BuzzFeed News that on May 1, the same day the story about the former bodyguard was published, executive producers took the rare move of holding an all-staff meeting over Zoom to address the negative stories and low morale. “I think it is a lot of smoke and mirrors when it comes to the show’s brand,” a former employee said. “They pull on people’s heartstrings; they do know that’s going to get likes and what people are going to go for, which is a positive message. But that’s not always reality.”",0
1446709351725424646,Ellen Degeneres is a racist POS & I just need everyone to know that.,"After working on The Ellen DeGeneres Show for nearly a year, one former employee said they took medical leave for one month to check into a mental health facility for a suicide attempt. But the week they returned to work, they were told their position was being eliminated. “You'd think that if someone just tried to kill themselves, you don’t want to add any more stress to their lives,” the employee, whose story was corroborated by four other employees and medical records, told BuzzFeed News. “Some of the producers talk openly in public about addiction and mental health awareness, but they’re the reason there’s a stigma,” they said. “They definitely don’t practice what they preach with the ‘be kind’ mantra."" Another former employee said they were fired after an unexpectedly difficult year that required them to take time away from the job on three occasions: medical leave for three weeks after they were in a car accident, working remotely for two days to attend a family member’s funeral, and then three days off to travel for another family member’s funeral. Each request was a battle with supervisors and HR, they added. “That’s the definition of a toxic work environment, where they make you feel like you’re going insane and then you’re like, no, everything I was feeling was right. It was all leading up to this,” the former staffer, whose story was corroborated by five former employees and medical records, said. A third former employee said they were given a warning for creating a GoFundMe campaign to raise money for medical costs that weren’t covered by their company health insurance and then sharing it on social media. Just 24 hours after posting the GoFundMe, they said, they were called into the department head’s office and told to take it down because of concerns it might hurt DeGeneres’s image. “They discovered my fundraiser, then got mad at me. … They were more concerned about Ellen’s brand instead of helping me out,” the former employee, whose story was corroborated by four other employees, told BuzzFeed News. About one month later, this employee said they were fired after posting a selfie laughing with coworkers at the office on a personal Instagram story — a violation of their contract — even though others had posted similar photos before. “Be kind to the world,” they said, “not your employees.”",0
1446709351725424646,Ellen Degeneres is a racist POS & I just need everyone to know that.,"According to employees, there’s a division between staff members who work on the show: people who “drink the Kool-Aid” and are usually well-liked by producers, and people who recognize the work environment is toxic. Those who push back against senior producers don’t usually have their contracts renewed, former employees said. “They hire people who maybe are inexperienced with how a functional, nontoxic work environment actually is, or someone who just wants to be in that atmosphere so bad that they'll put up with it,” one former employee claimed. “They kind of feed off of that, like, ‘This is Ellen; this is as good as it gets. You'll never find anything better than this.’” According to former staffers, those who have “more likable” personality traits, who are willing to work the 10-plus-hour days without complaint, and who actively ignore how managers and senior-level producers treat others have been given new iPhones, JetBlue gift cards, and other swag the show keeps on hand from its sponsors. “I remember feeling depressed and horrible and sad and just thinking that I can’t leave but I want to leave,” one former employee said. “Everyone was unhappy unless you were one of those people being favored.” Some employees defended the show’s work culture, saying it’s typical of TV production, but other former employees with experience in the industry said The Ellen DeGeneres Show stood apart as particularly negative. “We all have a kind of ‘this isn’t normal’ feeling about how people get treated there,” one former employee claimed. “And there’s this ushering out the door. Or your contract isn’t renewed the minute you ruffle anyone’s feathers. Or you don't show that you're extremely grateful and appreciative to work there.” The employees who spoke to BuzzFeed News said they worked in a culture dominated by fear. One of them said a general feeling among staffers was “if you have an issue, don't even think about bringing it up.” “I never felt like it was safe to go to my manager when I had issues — because this was the same person who would wait for me to go to the bathroom and then message me, asking me where I was and why I wasn’t at my desk,” one employee said. “People focus on rumors about how Ellen is mean and everything like that, but that's not the problem. The issue is these three executive producers running the show who are in charge of all these people [and] who make the culture and are putting out this feeling of bullying and being mean,” another former employee claimed. “They feel that everybody who works at The Ellen Show is lucky to work there — ‘So if you have a problem, you should leave because we’ll hire someone else because everybody wants to work here.’” And when people did leave — or get fired — managers never addressed the team about it, employees said. “We had Friday morning weekly meetings, and sometimes people who we worked with forever just wouldn’t be there,” one former employee said, “like, they disappeared, and it was never explained."" ●",0

1446709351725424646,Ellen Degeneres is a racist POS & I just need everyone to know that.,"In the early years of his career, Tobey Maguire’s youthful and boyish looks landed him many roles, he got a role in Ang Lee’s The Ice Storm playing a teenage boarding school student, and he played similarly teenager / young adult roles in Pleasantville, The Cider House Rules and Wonder Boys. His youthful looks also helped to catapult him to superstar status by playing a young adult version of Peter Parker in Spider-man I & II. The problem with his appearance is it didn’t change as he grew older, it feel weird and awkward when he played a dark or grim character with the look of a teenager, he couldn’t really play a mature character, something his close friend Leonardo DiCaprio managed to overcome. In 2013’s The Great Gatsby, Leo and Tobey costarred together, and the contrast between their performance stood out: Leonardo DiCaprio was playing a handsome and charismatic man, Tobey Maguire was playing an awkward teenager.",0
1446709351725424646,Ellen Degeneres is a racist POS & I just need everyone to know that.,"Tobey got greedy, and Spider-Man III’s critical disaster certainly didn’t help him. Despite a huge profit, Spider-Man III was a poor film, especially when compared to its predecessors, the evil dance and the attempt at a dark and edgier version of Spider-man didn’t work. There was also Maguire overestimating his important with the Spider-man film, in Spider-Man (2002), Tobey Maguire was paid 4 million for Peter Parker, the film earned 821 million worldwide, it was a massive hit and Maguire thought he was untouchable and irreplaceable, he was wrong. When he tried to play hard ball and holdout on the film with Sony, they looked for an alternative actor in Jake Gyllenhaal, this forced Tobey Maguire to be more accommodating and take a lower (still a massive paycheck) salary than he had intended at 32.5 million for Spider-Man II & III. Spider-Man II certainly delivered a good sequel to its predecessor, but Spider-Man III suffered from too many subplots, too many villains (Sandman, Venom, and Goblin Jr.), the aforementioned cringe worthy “evil dance,” I don’t need Sandman, Venom and Goblin Jr., just get Doc Ock back and we’re good.",0

Brothers is a highly acclaimed movie where Maguire showed he still has raw talent and the acting chops on playing a character with PTSD, he earned a Golden Globe nomination alongside Natalie Portman and Jake Gyllenhaal. In Great Gatsby, although he is the main character, Leo’s charisma and performance managed to push him onto the sidelines, this shows he couldn’t really carry the weight of a lead actor in older and maturer roles.

According to Molly Bloom’s memoir, Maguire was the “worst tipper, the best player, and the absolute worst loser.” He apparently made Molly Bloom “bark like a seal who want a fish to get a $1,000 chip”. Michael Cera plays Player X in Molly’s Game, although the character is an amalgamtion of various celebrity players including Leo DiCaprio, Ben Affleck and Tobey Maguire, the scathing memoir and the antagonistic attitudes all show who this player is.

When I delivered his breakfast to the make-up trailer, she was at the far end & just staring daggers at me. Right from the get go, she wanted me fired & made it her mission to make my life miserable. When she couldn’t get me fired, she came up with the most creative ways to make me look bad. She sent her minions to ask me to write out EVERYTHING I did during the day & have it sent to her. Then, in front of the crew, she blurted “what IS this (referring to the craft table), do you know how hard these people work? I received many sympathetic looks from the crew, most of whom I’d worked with for years. She continued to shame & embarrass me but my PM (production manager) came to my rescue & told her that if I go, HE goes. I had been specifically asked for because of my experience & personality and managed to get through the entire show.

They delivered their initial arguments in early September and then responded to each other. Both authors assumed, as many readers also did, a Clinton victory. When the election results came in, Randi Weingarten and Leo Casey asked to rewrite their essay in order to take fuller account of the outcome of the election. Larry Cohen agreed to this arrangement. However, he elected to leave his essay as originally written. He has added a brief addendum that also takes account of the election results. Since Weingarten and Casey withdrew their original contribution, it no longer made sense to publish the replies each had written in response to each other. Readers should keep in mind that the main part of Cohen’s contribution was written without knowing how the election would turn out, while the Weingarten and Casey essay was written after that outcome had been decided.",0
1445875683129892868,I really dislike Terry McAuliffe. I dislike him almost as much as I hate Hillary Clinton.,"From the earliest days of the Presidential campaign, it was clear that 2016 would not be a typical election year: many voters were feeling cheated out of the “American dream” and deeply angry with the political establishment. The Republican Party was captured by its most illiberal and intolerant forces. In the person of Donald Trump, we will now confront a President who has brought into the mainstream of American politics and government a toxic brew of overt racial, ethnic and religious bigotry, misogyny, authoritarianism, appeals to political violence and attacks on immigrants and unions.",0

It is a time for reflection and thoughtful analysis, not recrimination and finger-pointing: we need to inform what will now be a decisive struggle to defend democracy and to regain the initiative for progressive policies that empower working people. In that spirit, we offer the following thoughts on the subject.",0
1445875683129892868,I really dislike Terry McAuliffe. I dislike him almost as much as I hate Hillary Clinton.,"The AFT and most of the American labor movement endorsed Hillary for President, both in the Democratic primaries and the general election, as the candidate that we believed had the best chance to win the 2016 election and enact a progressive policy agenda. Against a Republican candidate who sorely lacked the experience, judgment and temperament to be President, Hillary Clinton was the most experienced and qualified candidate of the last century, and her election as the first woman President would have been an historic advance for the cause of gender equality. She brought a lifetime of successful work on behalf of progressive causes to the campaign, and under her leadership and in partnership with Bernie Sanders and his campaign, the Democratic Party adopted the most progressive platform of its history in 2016. Clinton had a particular knack for translating ideas and aspirations for change into government policies that make a difference.",0
1445875683129892868,I really dislike Terry McAuliffe. I dislike him almost as much as I hate Hillary Clinton.,"When a candidate loses the way Clinton did, by razor thin margins in a number of battleground states, one can point to a number of factors each one of which made the difference between victory and defeat. Most important were the anti-democratic features of the American political system. As we write in the week immediately following the election, the tally has Clinton winning the popular ballot by as much two million votes. It is only the archaic Electoral College that has translated that unambiguous margin into a defeat: in every other democratic polity, she would be the victor. Moreover, voter suppression laws in Michigan, North Carolina and Wisconsin clearly made the difference in those key battleground states, tipping the Electoral College to the Republicans. And while the total Democratic vote for the House of Representatives is currently ahead of the Republican vote, gerrymandering has delivered a 40+ seat Republican majority in that Congressional body.",0
1445875683129892868,I really dislike Terry McAuliffe. I dislike him almost as much as I hate Hillary Clinton.,"The 2016 election also witnessed the unprecedented interventions of the FBI and the Russian state, to the benefit of Trump. The baseless letter from FBI Director Comey, raising doubts about Clinton’s e-mails that the agency had in fact already reviewed and cleared, reversed her momentum late in the campaign. (Trump confidante and former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski has acknowledged the decisive impact of Comey’s letter. ) The emails of Clinton campaign and DNC staff hacked by intelligence agencies of the Russian state and released at critical times and in coordination with the Trump campaign through WikiLeaks also took a toll. Both developments made the Trump victory possible, and both are deeply troubling for the future of free and fair elections that are the cornerstone of every democracy.",0
1445875683129892868,I really dislike Terry McAuliffe. I dislike him almost as much as I hate Hillary Clinton.,"The Clinton campaign, the DNC and those of us in the labor movement could have secured electoral victory with different decisions in a few pivotal areas. The Democratic vote in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin could have been shored up with timely interventions and additional resources, keeping those traditionally ‘blue’ states from turning ‘red’ by the narrowest of margins. While Clinton and the Democratic platform had good policy proposals for addressing economic inequality and fostering good jobs, the campaign never put them together in a compelling message that connected with blue collar workers in ‘rust belt’ states ravaged by corporate dominated economic globalization. Too many of these workers concluded that the Democrats would not bring real change to their lives. Going forward, American labor and the Democratic Party must develop an economic program and highlight class issues that convincingly take on what have been decades of economic losses to working people in the American heartland.",0
1445875683129892868,I really dislike Terry McAuliffe. I dislike him almost as much as I hate Hillary Clinton.,"Yet tragically there was more than a class dynamic at work: many white male workers viewed their economic interests through a distorting prism of race and sex. The 2016 election saw a significant backlash vote in which ‘others’ – most prominently, people of color, immigrants, women, LGBTQ people, Muslims and Jews – were scapegoated for the declining economic and social status of white male workers. Trump’s strategy for breaking through the ‘blue wall’ of Democratic states was to appeal to the racial, sexual and religious fears and resentments of white voters, and he was sufficiently successful at this gambit to win a close election. His overt racism, misogyny and bigotry has done real damage to America’s struggle to overcome these evils, and left many Americans deeply fearful for their place in our society. In the dark times ahead, the American labor must hold true to our core values, continuing both the battle for the economic interests of all working people and the struggle against racial, sexual and religious oppression.",0

I dislike him almost as much as I hate Hillary Clinton.,"Throughout the 2016 campaign, there were those who argued that it was more important for American unions to advance a broad vision of economic justice and long term, maximalist goals than to focus on winning this election. In this view, a Trump victory was an acceptable price to be paid if it results in a future greater good. Some even contended, against all historical precedent, that a Trump victory would hasten that greater good. Unfortunately, we will now witness the damage that a Trump victory holds for the labor movement’s quest for economic justice and for the social democratic policies it advocates.",0
1445875683129892868,I really dislike Terry McAuliffe. I dislike him almost as much as I hate Hillary Clinton.,"1. She loses. She lost to Obama in the 2008 primaries, in what should have been “her” election. Her victories are typically unopposed or in safe districts. Being a presidential candidate is going to be a tough struggle and generally requires a candidate who’s won some tough battles.
2. She had a target on her back. EVERYBODY knew that she was a lighting rod for Republican criticism. Fair or not, this is reality, and just burying your head in the sand and pretending that it doesn’t matter was a stupid decision. Nominating one of the most hated people in politics is a phenomenally poor choice that reflects an astounding degree of hubris in the DNC.
3. She bought her own hype. “Most qualified candidate ever”, “Most admired woman in the world”, etc. This is hype… It’s great, but it’s all dubious measurements and her team seemed to start believing that her election was inevitable, and failed to take the steps to make it happen.
4. She was a clearly establishment candidate who ran in a year with massive anti-establishment undertones. That’s just bad luck, really, but it was predictable.
5. A trend of unforced errors. The private server, the meeting between Bill and Lynch, the deplorables comment, freaking out over a cartoon frog… There is an indication that nobody was in the Clinton camp saying “um, guys, I don’t think this is a good idea”. It seemed to be a campaign run by yes-men and sycophants. You need opposition on your team. If you have 12 men in a room and they all agree, you need the thirteenth man to say “something isn’t right here”. The world is never that clear cut.
6. Poor media strategy. While Clinton was relentless in attacking Trump, Trump was actually talking about policy… Clinton also made some really dubious decisions in terms of her partners… Having Lena Dunham run your Instagram is a phenomenally stupid decision that goes beyond mere unforced error to a vastly warped idea about how media (especially social media) works. Just as most Republicans need to distance themselves from certain far-right groups, Democrats need to distance themselves from nutty far-left ones… But in an attempt to outflank Sanders on the left, Clinton often pandered to them, and that stuff got endless play in conservative circles. The world has changed, and Clinton (or her staff) didn’t appear to understand it.
7. Focusing on wedge issues that have dubious voter value over a core message. This wasn’t so much her, but it was her supporters and the DNC apparatus… Bathroom bills and stupid gun control schemes may play well to your base, but they don’t play for shit to a hell of a lot of America where you need votes. Clinton’s message was largely “everything is fine”, which a lot of voters clearly disagreed with. She needed an alternative to “Make America Great Again” and she never really found it.",0

One writer on this page suggests that Hillary Clinton ""rode to fame on the coattails of her husband."" Of course any such conclusion is the perfect example of sexism. It assumes that a woman has no accomplishments independent of her husband. 
 
Hillary Clinton graduated with honors from Wellesley College where her commencement address was featured in Time (June 13, 1969) and Life  (June 20, 1969). 
 
After graduating from Yale University School of Law, she went on to work for the Child's Defense Fund in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Her article, ""Children Under the Law,"" was published in the Harvard Educational Review. 
 
In 1974 she was a staff lawyer of the House Judiciary Committee during its consideration of impeachment charges against Richard Nixon. 
 
Please keep in mind that all of these things above occurred BEFORE Bill and Hillary got married. 
 
In 1978 President Jimmy Carter appointed her to chair the Legal Services Corporation Bureau. a federally-financed independent body that distributes legal aide funds. 
 
 In 1988 and again in 1991,  she was named on of the ""100 Most influential Lawyers in America"" by the National Law Review.",0
1445875683129892868,I really dislike Terry McAuliffe. I dislike him almost as much as I hate Hillary Clinton.,"Of course, Hillary was twice elected to the United States Senate before serving as the Secretary of State. 
 
Anyone who asserts that ""she rode to fame on the coat tails of her husband"" is either ignorant of Hillary's achievements or hopes that her readers are. Considering her popularity as First Lady of Arkansas and her effectiveness as an advocate for her husband in the 1992 Presidential election, it's fairer to say that Bill was elected on the coattails of his wife.
 
Someone wrote,  
""I ... hate when people get into positions of authority simply because of who they're related to.""
 
Of course this is a strange comment considering the number of political leaders we've had who have a family connection. When it's a man (Franklin Roosevelt's connection to Theodore Roosevelt, Robert Kennedy's connection to John Kennedy, George HW Bush's connection to Prescott Bush, George W. Bush's connection to George HW Bush, Al Gore, Jr. and his connection to Al Gore, Sr., and Mitt Romney's connection to George Romney), it seems acceptable. But let a woman have a connection, then somehow she's not a true feminist and getting a free ride. Talk about a double-standard. 
 
Another bizarre complaint is that Hillary stayed married to her husband. It's funny that we've gotten to the point where people who stay together to repair a damaged  marriage are the ones who are criticized. Perhaps that critic prefers those politicians who trade their wives in for younger models, sometimes more than once.

Sept. 20

Independent counsel Robert Ray today filed his long-awaited report on the Whitewater investigation, clearing President Clinton and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton of any criminal wrongdoing. 
The official report, sent by Ray to a three-judge panel, is not expected to be finalized for several weeks. But Ray released a six-page statement today that concludes neither the president nor Mrs. Clinton intentionally violated the law in the botched Whitewater real estate deal.",0

Notice most of the anti-Hillary posts don't focus on her views on taxes, immigration, the use of the military, the minimum wage, or health care. They don't talk about her votes in the US Senate. They don't refer to her performance as Secretary of State.

I’ve met with multiple current and former U.S. Senators and Representatives, several candidates and members of the North Carolina General Assembly, and have spoken numerous times with the current Governor of North Carolina.

1445875683129892868,I really dislike Terry McAuliffe. I dislike him almost as much as I hate Hillary Clinton.,I think there are several reasons why Hillary seems to be particularly disliked:,0
1445875683129892868,I really dislike Terry McAuliffe. I dislike him almost as much as I hate Hillary Clinton.,"* We know enough about her to know that she isn’t magical - Society has created the unrealistic approach that a president should be a “magical leader” who never makes mistakes. In practice no such magical leaders exist, but the expectation that presidents should be magical means that we turn against potential leaders when we discover that they, like all people before them, aren’t magical.
 * Her cautious approach to the media allows opponents to define her by caricature - Trump has demonstrated that, in the new media landscape, the most effective way to reach voters is through the media, rather than advertising. However the media will only quote you if you say something exciting enough that they can write a story that will get re-shared. While Hillary’s cautious approach may have avoided “gaffes” it has also made it hard for her to define herself and allowed her opponents to define her by caricature.
 * She is a woman - Let’s not pretend that sexism (particularly unconscious sexism) doesn’t exist.
I think that the “magical leader” issue is particularly important:",0
1445875683129892868,I really dislike Terry McAuliffe. I dislike him almost as much as I hate Hillary Clinton.,"* Popular culture explains the world in terms of “magical leaders” - These people are more like gods than normal people. They understand everything. They never make mistakes. They can make all decisions directly themselves. They are smarter than all their subordinates. They are the Presidents, the CEOs, the great scientific thinkers.
 * No magical leaders actually exist - They just don’t. Every time you get close to someone presented as magical, you discover that they are flawed like everyone else. They make mistakes. They have superficial understandings of important issues. They give speeches written by other people. Their ideas are simple combinations of ideas from other people. They make errors of judgement. The “magical leader” persona you read about externally is just a re-branding of the actions of a much larger organization.
 * Real progress is made by organizations, not magical leaders - The role of a leader isn’t to make good decisions, or to understand things, but to oversee the creation of an organization that can make good decisions, and understand things. Good leaders hire the best people, make sure they have a consistent vision, delegate each problem to the person best able to solve it, and make sure that decisions being made are consident with each other. However our individualistic culture likes to present the output of this organization as all being due to a magical leader.
 * We expect presidential candidates to be magical leaders, and turn against them when we realise they aren’t - This is the reason why there is so much anger about things like Benghazi, and wrong stances Hillary took in the past. It’s because it reveals that Hillary isn’t a magical leader - just like nobody is a magical leader. Donald Trump has never held a government position before, and so we can still imagine that maybe he might be magical.
 * Experienced leaders are at a disadvantage, because we know enough about them to know they aren’t magical leaders - Even if a leader does the right thing 90% of the time, they are going to make mistakes 10% of the time. If our criteria for choosing a leader is the lack of evidence that they aren’t a magical leader then we will always prefer the less experienced candidate.

In my opinion, most people who dislike Hillary Clinton do so for this reason. These people are gullible.
2. Some people dislike Hillary Clinton because she is a brilliant and talented woman who makes no apologies for her ambition. They hated her from the moment she said that she didn’t want to be like Tammy Wynette, and then tried to improve their healthcare system. These people are sexists.
3. Some others dislike her because she went to Wellesley and Yale Law, wrote several successful books, earned $200K per speaking engagement, and along with her husband has a net worth of over $100 million. These people are jealous.

Bill came to me with an idea for doing it with only 1.67n flips. We proved his algorithm correct, and we proved a lower bound—it cannot be done faster than 1.06n flips.

1445452647071293444,donald trump is a fucking thot,"Every time the POTUS goes somewhere on Air Force One, it costs nearly a million dollars, round trip, just for transportation. And then there’s the issue of housing and feeding his entourage and security detail while he’s at his golf courses. He might have the right to use those facilities at no cost, but US taxpayers pay the cost of housing everybody around him in the same luxe accommodations. If the President is staying at a five star resort that he still owns, it’s not like his security detail and staff can stay at the Super 8 motel 20 miles away. Trump is on track to cost the taxpayers more in vacation expenditures before the end of his first year in office than Obama cost us during the entire duration of his administration.",0
1445452647071293444,donald trump is a fucking thot,"Should the president be able to take vacation? Absolutely. Should the president be able to take weekly vacations costing us more than a million dollars each? Come on. That’s ridiculous. If he golfs in Florida once a week for his first term, that’s a $312 million taxpayer expenditure (conservatively, not counting whatever the Air Force spends to enforce a no-fly zone and defend the air space over Palm Beach). If, instead of flying to Florida to golf once a week, he instead did so once a month for the next 4 years, the taxpayers could instead secure federal funding for Meals-on-Wheels for the next 8 years.",0
1445452647071293444,donald trump is a fucking thot,"No one would complain about his golfing outings if he was golfing in the D.C. area, but he's not. Let’s go back to the campaign when he was criticizing President Obama about playing golf. First, he said in an interview to the USA newspaper, “I would rarely leave the White House because there is so much work that needs to be done.” Then, how he won't have time to play golf. These are his words. Camp David was made in 1942 during President Roosevelt’s term, then during President Truman’s it became the official retreat for the President. Camp David is staffed 24/7 just in case the President wants to go there. Trump does not like Camp David, again his words. We cannot forget that Mr. Trump does not take a salary for being the President, God bless him. Now let’s look at the costs that we, the taxpayers, have to fork over for one of his golf weekends. Air Force One, round trip to Mar-A-Lago, ONE MILLION DOLLARS! That's just for the flight. Now we have the rooms for all his staff and the Secret Service, plus the car rental. It costs almost $3,000 dollars just for golf cart rentals. Total for a weekend golf trip, a little over 3 million dollars! In the first 29 weeks in office Trump spent 24 weekends playing golf in Florida and N.J. So, one of his weekends is 7 times a President’s salary. Let's not forget the profit from the weekend goes to Trump, because he owns the hotels they’re all staying at. To date Trump's weekend travel costs for less than one term is almost double of President Obama's for 2 terms in office. When asked about this Trump said that when he's golfing he's also working, because sometimes he golfs with world leaders or other government officials, and they’re talking about our country. The man does know how to turn on the bullshit. If you try to talk to a Trump supporter about this, or any of Trump screw ups, all they say is that he's the best President we have ever had, and that he's making a real difference in Washington. Also, that all the bad things are just the fake news outlets telling lies. I tell them that's the same thing people were saying in 1974 about President Nixon. They were saying the Washington Post was fake news, and they were just out to hurt him, but we all know the truth about it now. The difference there was that President Nixon was a good President, in part, where Trump is… well, we all know what Trump is.",0
1445452647071293444,donald trump is a fucking thot,"Why are people whining, about the President taking his weekends off to golf?",0
1445452647071293444,donald trump is a fucking thot,Firstly because the taxpayer is paying for him going to his favourite golf courses which costs millions of dollars especially if we take the obligatory security measures into account.

Do not EVER tell a Dom “no-limits”. That will get you a flippant answer on the order of “So you will be totally ok with me skinning you alive right?”. If it doesn’t get that sort of answer you REALLY don’t want to be alone with him. Go for the low end when negotiating limits. If he doesn’t agree then he is not the Dom for you. If he argues the limits then he probably isn’t the Dom for anyone who likes to live. You can always negotiate the limits higher as you gain experience. The key there is YOU can negotiate higher, not him. If he thinks something you agreed to is beyond what you can take then he is perfectly free to not do it. But he isn’t free to just try something before talking to you about it. Also being a sub does not have to involve sensation play (I use that term instead pain play because a bunny fur flogger is a lot of things but painful is not one of them).",0

Now at no point did she safeword the play, but due to me keeping an eye on her reactions I stopped play. She started to complain about me stopping till I took her down and her legs wouldn’t hold her. I had to carry her to a chair and hold her with a blanket over us till she warmed up and recovered. It was not caused by anything wrong nor did I go anywhere near her limits, I just did a lot of different things. I didn’t even leave a bruise on her. This is actually what you want in a top and the same type of mindset in a Dom. I was not at my personal limits but she had hit her limit for the night so I stopped play. I was not the least bit annoyed that play stopped early and I didn’t get to do all I wanted. I just cuddled her and got her out of sub space gently. This is the sort of thing you want in a Dom. Not just while playing either. Now am I a good Dom? I can’t say. Am I a good Top? I can answer that one with a yes. And yes they are different things.

Wouldn’t matter if I had seen the person play to the point they were bleeding a few weeks before. Yes that happened and yes I still treated her like she was new the first time we played. Oh and she not only enjoyed playing to the bleed point she had a couple of orgasms from it. Which I knew and still didn’t go that hard. After we played she just looked at me and told me that she liked the way I did it and now that I knew she wouldn’t break and how she reacted she would expect me to play a lot harder the next time.

I am not saying Ronaldo doesn’t surprise me. He also dribbles and score ‘lots’ of goals but for a casual viewer his abilities are that he can jump higher than others, he can run faster, shoot more powerfully etc. But that is it. These are super-humane but still in believable category. Messi on the other hand warrants a certain awe and for a first time viewer of football, he can hook him to the game.
 * Then there are those play the sport, not on the pro level but on slightly lower level. now for an upcoming player, Ronaldo is God. Ronaldo shows that by practicing harder than anyone else, by having a single minded focus on your goal i.e. to score more goals, you can surpass the limits of a normal human being. Messi, in that sense can’t be emulated because we can all agree that, although he must work hard and practice as hard as anyone else, there is something naturally gifted in him, which you can’t learn. Thats why I find Ronaldo to be popular among many young footballers. Because he shows its possible.
 * And then there are the Pundits. Most of them have played the highest level of football in the best clubs and of course internationally. Try listening to Rio Ferdinand about Messi. They regard Messi as just a bit better than Ronaldo because they know you can plan against Ronaldo, but Messi can create a goal all by himself. Some of his teammates and people who have seen him practice up close have said that the stuff that Messi does on the fields is nothing compared to the stuff he does during the practice. He can run the ball from goal post to goal post all by himself through all the Barca defenders. And again these Pundits love the game of Football more than winning a match. And thus they regard Ronaldo as amazing but Messi as someone beyond, coz he makes Football beautiful.",0

A couple of years back, I casually asked one of my very close friends, whom I used to consider a football fan - Hey who is better? Ronaldo or Messi? He thought for few seconds and answered Ronaldo and gave me a reason that Ronaldo is a more complete player. So whenever I used to meet my friends or relatives and then this unending debate comes up who is better between the two, I used to tell the exact same thing - Ronaldo, he is a more complete player. The truth was that I didn’t know name of any other footballer apart from Messi or Ronaldo, not even Neymar. The only other footballer I knew at that time was Sunil Chetri, Indian Football captain. I have never seen a football match ever before. My younger brother has been following football from a long time. He asked me whom do I admire most - Messi or Ronaldo? I answered the same - Ronaldo. He asked me since when I am following football? I told I haven’t seen even a single match. He smiled and told me watch these two play, watch their matches, your opinions will surely change.",0

I told what a crap player, he can’t even score a penalty. My brother just smiled and didn’t say anything. I came back to Bangalore, back to my hostel. There was this do or die match for Argentina against Nigeria. Suddenly, Messi scored a goal, a goal which left me speechless.

No body is more threatening inside the box than Ronaldo. He is the best in the world when it comes to headers. But Messi scores the same number of goals as well. Moreover, currently he holds the most number of European Golden Shoe - 5. So both Messi and Ronaldo comes are at the same level as a goal scorer. Ronaldo’s strength inside the box is his power, his aerial threat, his strong wrong foot whereas Messi’s strength is his accuracy. Messi’s precision is a match to none.",0

4. Somewhere I feel Ronaldo is a better big game player than Messi.
5. Since Ronaldo’s move to Juventus, many have started to tell that Ronaldo has proved himself by playing in different leagues - Portugal, England, Spain and now Italy. But when I listened Messi saying his dream is to finish his career with Barcelona (and even Barcelona is currently working on a new contract for Messi which will allow Messi to be at Barcelona beyond 2021). My happiness knew no boundary when I heard this from Messi. I can easily bet - a loyal Messi fan will be more delighted to this Messi’s dream of finishing his career at Barcelona than a loyal Barcelona fan. I can fight with this world over the opinion that playing in multiple leagues makes you a better footballer than playing in one league all your life (except if the league is France’s damn boring Ligue 1, I am talking about only top 5 European leagues). Loyalty has been a factor which is endangered among humans. Moreover, Ronaldo has played at Manchester United, Real Madrid and Juventus, he has always been surrounded by great players who guarantee him of providing enough chances inside the box, which has been the biggest strength of Ronaldo.
6. Messi has never won anything (except Under 19 World Cup) with Argentina, whereas Ronaldo has won Euro 2016 with Portugal. I don’t know it was Messi’s inability to win in tremendous pressure or he has been seriously unlucky, but I feel even Ronaldo doesn’t guarantee winning a title for this shit unorganized Argentina football team. Messi has been part of 4 finals, this itself is not easy. But people will say Ronaldo has edge over Messi on this point and they have the right to say so.
I can write and write ,but my answer is already too long. If anyone say I am a blind Messi fan, the I will say I AM PROUD TO BE A BLIND MESSI FAN. FOOTBALL MEANS NOTHING TO ME , SPORTS MEANS NOTHING TO ME, IF IT IS NOT FOR LIONEL MESSI.",0

He was injured very early put down twice by Casemiro in the first half. Marcelo's early stray elbow left the five-time World Player of the Year floored, blood pouring from his mouth. Heavy foul by Ramos brought him a red. The cotton was still planted in his mouth when he weaved beyond Nacho and Dani Carvajal to level at 1-1 before the break. After Victor Valdes, I personally felt this guy is the right one in front of the post, The German Ter Stegen saved half dozens of shots targeted to make heavy cheers in the stadium. Rakitic, the man scored the second one was absolutely in threshold, Iniesta pulled his experience as always. I felt like he was looking to his right when he was crossing the Reals Pentagon in the box just to see Xavi is there to collect. Pique missed couple, nothing new. Suarez, Busquets and Alba did their job. Gomez was right sub. Umtiti conceded yellow, yes this is el classico, when real got a red at least a yellow need to fight.

It’s all depressing Trump stuff. And they all do a great job. Seth Meyers is a great writer; Jimmy Kimmel does a good job; Jimmy Fallon does a great job. I like Stephen Colbert, Trevor Noah [on Comedy Central] and Samantha Bee [on TBS]. The trouble is that there’s such negativity now. When I did the show, Bush was dumb and Clinton was horny and it was human problems. Now it’s all anti-women, anti-LGBT, anti-Muslim, anti-Mexican, anti-Salvadoran; it’s such a negative thing. God bless all the late-night hosts, they make it funny, but ultimately, it’s depressing. You don’t really watch late-night TV to get away from reality anymore; now it’s more in your face. You laugh but then you go to bed going, “Oh man, the world is really pretty rough.” And it’s not, it’s one man that causes all these problems!",0

My wife was so depressed when Trump was elected but I said, “This will be the greatest thing that ever happens to the women’s movement.” Because even men who are apathetic are going, “Whoa, wait a minute.” Harvey Weinstein was a catalyst, but Trump really started [the groundswell].

But now, even the worst guys in the world, guys who cheated every day, are saying, “Whoa, this is bad!” Ultimately, something good will come out of it. I always used to meet young women who would say, “I’m not a feminist or anything but I want to get the same money as a guy.” I’d say, “What do you think it means to be a feminist?” Now they’re beginning to understand.

At my age, I can’t pretend to know all of Jay-Z’s music. When you’re 40, you talk to the 26-year-old supermodels and it’s sexy; when you’re 67, you’re the creepy old guy. At some point, you need to step back and say, “I did it.” I was lucky enough to live in a time when we did very well and the show was No. 1 and then say thank you and step back. That’s why I came back with something totally different [CNBC’s Jay Leno’s Garage] — it’s nothing like what I did. This is a hobby and it’s fun. It’s what I like to do.

Second, NBC horrifically botched Leno’s own 2009 Tonight Show handoff to Conan O’Brien, hedging by giving Leno his own hour-long 10 p.m. show to keep him from jumping to another network.

(Leno apparently booked Maron on the late-period Tonight Show solely to determine whether Maron really hated him.) As for Jay Leno superfans—are there Jay Leno superfans? Is it such a terrible thing if there aren’t?—Maron’s goal is to get his guest to express regret, to apologize, to grovel at the feet of his many haters, from Howard Stern to Conan himself.

The Conan debacle is less than a decade old but feels positively ancient: You boys were arguing about time slots? And comprehending his original sin—beating out Letterman as Carson’s successor in ’92—depends on your ability to still view the two candidates as different species. “I was the establishment guy, and Dave was the hip guy,” Leno tells Maron, still making the case for himself: He’d been guest-hosting for Carson for five years, and, unlike Letterman, was willing to travel around and schmooze with every NBC affiliate, and Letterman’s edginess made him ideal for his night-owl time slot.

(These days it’s Dave getting berated on his own damn show, this time by Tina Fey.) He is apologizing, in TV-show form, for all those super-hip years of not giving a shit. This guy was a bad boy?

Revisiting some of his old stand-up, Leno’s appeal is indeed enormous. It’s less any one joke he tells than his winsome, apolitical, utterly nonthreatening manner: the national-monument chin, the twinkly and parody-ready voice, the gentle everyman wit.

It was awfully genial for something so fundamentally mean-spirited. Talking to Maron, Leno describes his style of humor like this: “It’s what you call evergreen topical. ’Cause most people don’t know anything. I learned on The Tonight Show, once you get past secretary of state, nobody has any idea who you’re talking about. They just don’t know anything. So you have to talk about, How ’bout the ECONOMY?

But his notion of comedy as pure joy—no neurosis, no ruffled feathers, no political subtext—is now unexpectedly radical, even if you emphatically reject it. It is most definitely not the future. But it’s a useful prism through which to view his own troubled past. Leno seems to have few regrets about Letterman, and even fewer about Conan’s ultimate decision to quit: “To me, when you’re on, you’re winning,” is how he summarizes his TV philosophy.

He is vehemently against our 2nd amendment by perverting it into an issue about hunting & pursuing things like a ban on so called “assault weapons” & magazine capacity restrictions. He claims he’s not taking anyone’s guns BUT what he wants to do is force you to either surrender your firearm (if deemed an assault weapon) or pay $200 per firearm to the government under a reinterpretation of gun laws of the past (1934,1968, 1986 etc) & have each registered with the government. His Vice President is open to the idea of reparations which would absolutely spark another civil war. Biden himself isn’t all there mentally & I fear any foreign crisis we face would need to be delegated further down the command chain for a decision on how to proceed. He says he wants unity but also was evasive about Supreme Court packing, & he has signed a flurry of executive actions since taking office. As a Libertarian leaning Independent I agree with him actually on issues of personal liberty, women’s rights, gay rights, etc BUT what he is going to do is simply the bidding of the far left socialist democratic machine who wishes to impose equal outcomes rather than equal opportunity upon the American people. Anyone with a bit of common sense or understanding of things like economics, game theory, psychology, etc will understand that not only is this impossible BUT the attempt to impose it will cause not only economic destruction, but may very well lead to a hot civil war. Barack Obama was most likely the last Democrat presidential candidate I will ever vote for in my lifetime based on the party’s current platform. Biden isn’t in this for us, it’s been a nearly half century pursuit of his to become president & when he sadly lost his son Beau in 2015 to brain cancer, I believe his son had encouraged him to run for president (for a 3rd time in his lifetime). I respect & understand him being a family man, I have a daughter myself & we all have parents. I don’t think he’s evil, but I do think he is very unintelligent (I don’t care where he went to school), & I absolutely am sickened by his disrespect for our 2nd amendment. He may not take your guns, but he sure wants to limit your ability to legally buy certain weapons in the future & that to me is equally unacceptable.",0

As the night went on, readers' jokes about Teigen's trip turned into jokes about staying awake to not miss any updates on Teigen's trip; everyone, it seemed, was as invested in Teigen's journey as if they were on the plane themselves.",0

Why did Teigen and John Legend get served ramen? — but so are plenty of other stories shared by celebrities on social media. What made Teigen's tale so popular was not its uniqueness or its actual details, but the simple fact that it was Teigen's tale — and when Chrissy Teigen decides to tell a story on Twitter, the world listens up.",0
1445376305344630789,i really hate chrissy teigen,"It wasn't always this way. Although it might be hard now to remember a time when Teigen wasn't the unofficial Queen of Twitter, she's actually only been a major presence on the site for a few years. Starting around 2014, Teigen's tweets — with such gems like ""I always have a note in my pocket that says ""john did it"" just in case I'm murdered because I don't want him to remarry truelove tips"" — began catching on, elevating her from a successful but not particularly well-known model to a celebrity revered for her wit and just-like-you realness. As Twitter itself grew in popularity, so did Teigen, amassing millions of followers.",0
1445376305344630789,i really hate chrissy teigen,"But even still, it wasn't until about 2016 when her tweets truly became huge. Last year, with politics and the state of the world uneasier than ever, Teigen's sharp, funny, endlessly quotable posts (""Donald Trump can't even spell the word 'politician'"" is officially too literal of a joke,"" was one burn) acted as something of a salve.

And it's all thanks to her tweets (and Instagrams and Snapchats, which all go hand in hand). Over the last 12 months, Teigen's posts have become a bigger presence in our lives than ever before, with each new joke or comment made by the star automatically a must-read, and often a communal experience. When she needed ingredients to make banana bread, we all waited with baited breath to see who of her followers would come through; when she decided to get bangs, it was only after conducting a mock-serious Twitter poll with her fans. And whenever she posts photos featuring Legend or baby Luna, people react with a level of glee usually reserved for the babies of royals or Kardashian-Wests.",0

And all throughout it, Teigen has been tweeting, summarizing so many people's feelings about the Trump administration, nostalgia for Obama, and so much more. She's captured the cultural zeitgeist perfectly, understanding when we need a funny joke to lift our spirits or a passionate rebuke of some controversial policy.",0
1445376305344630789,i really hate chrissy teigen,"But perhaps more of it is due simply to Teigen's personality shining through in a greater way than in the past, due to the ever-growing popularity of social media. Teigen, through her tweets, gives us joy, and, for at least a few minutes, makes us feel better about our own lives or the state of the world. ""People love Chrissy Teigen because she’s real,"" explains Rosa Heyman, the Social Media Editor for Marie Claire. ""She shows her stretch marks on Instagram, she shows her bitchy side on Twitter...

And that includes ""flaws."" Teigen doesn't hesitate to post about the things many other celebrities would hesitate to share, from the state of her stretch marks to her past relationship struggles to her postpartum depression. Teigen uses Twitter as an extension of her honest personality, and that lets fans connect with her on a deep, personal level.

""People who struggle appreciate knowing others who share their pain.

But Teigen is just different, as 2017 has proved over and over again. Unlike other stars known for acting or singing or some other platform, Teigen's fame these days is intrinsically linked to her use of social media, and as such, that's the only side of her we get to see. The star's unparalleled use of Twitter has become her calling card, so much so that it's easy to forget that posting adorable photos of Luna and live-tweeting reality shows is not her actual career. If she were to delete her account, it'd be the equivalent of a movie star taking a break from Hollywood or an A-list singer stepping out of the spotlight instead of releasing a new album.",0

She's been a welcome presence in our lives for years now, but in 2017, she proved that she's a necessary one, too. Teigen's tweets add color into our world, and, more often than you'd expect, bring us all together, whether it's because of bangs, banana bread, or our need to laugh when the rest of the world is a total disaster.",0

1445376305344630789,i really hate chrissy teigen,"Such admissions were part of what made Teigen seem real, and gave her a bit of an edge. Besides, she playfully roasted her husband John Legend more than practically anyone (“eff that dude talk about zero talent”), so to most onlookers, her zingers didn’t seem to be all that personal. Plus, Teigen would candidly admit that being unfiltered on social media sometimes did really hurt her.",0
1445376305344630789,i really hate chrissy teigen,"“It wasn’t really an accepted thing within my modelling and TV career early on,” Teigen told Harpers Bazaar in 2017. “I would get in trouble, lots of phone calls from agents saying ‘Why did you tweet this? Now we’re in trouble with such-and-such a contract because you were too outspoken.’ I got so much feedback that I needed to watch my mouth if I wanted to work with certain people. And I remember sobbing so much because it was just the worst feeling, letting people down. I definitely lost work because people would shy away from being associated [with me], and I totally get it, too—they have to appeal to everybody.”",0
1445376305344630789,i really hate chrissy teigen,"Teigen insisted that she always simply refused to listen to those who told her to tone it down. “I’m happy I didn’t because now they look at you for the way you are, and I love being an open book,” she went on. “I feel like everyone knows what they’re getting now and it’s a very comfortable place to be in life.”",0

Her popularity soared.",0

1445376305344630789,i really hate chrissy teigen,"Endearingly, Teigen was cool enough to know those aggregations were lame. “if I had my choice, not a single story would ever be written about any tweets of mine,” Teigen tweeted in 2018. “they make people (me) seem like...the most annoying people. the ‘clapback’ wasn’t ‘epic’, it was just a fuccccccking tweet - just please stop with these stupid words.”",0

In 2019, Trump would go on a rampage after John Legend mentioned Trump’s latest criminal justice reform bill on a late-night show but didn’t give Trump as much credit as he preferred. “Guys like boring musician @johnlegend and his filthy-mouthed wife are talking now about how great [the bill] is – but I didn’t see them around when we needed help getting it passed,” Trump tweeted.",0

She’d been keeping him apprised of her general disdain for him for years before he took office, and strikingly, she did so in the same way she kept letting Stodden know she hated them.

No one can be declared “the internet’s funniest (and frankest) person” without courting overexposure. Moreover, Teigen’s status as one of Trump’s most vocal celebrity critics has made her a favorite target of the right-wing spectrum of the internet. (She’s been extensively harassed by QAnon followers.) So hisses of incipient anger have been brewing around her every post for years.",0
1445376305344630789,i really hate chrissy teigen,"In 2017, the popular celebrity gossip blogger Nicki Swift put together a video called “Shady Things About Chrissy Teigen Everyone Just Ignores.” Many of the offenses listed in the video are fairly benign, like Teigen’s tendency to discuss her and her husband’s sex life in more detail than a lot of other celebs would offer. But some of them tellingly foreshadowed the tweets to Stodden that would resurface in 2021: Teigen calling then-22-year-old Teen Mom star Farrah Abraham “a whore” who “everyone hates” in 2013; Teigen writing of then-9-year-old Quvenzhané Wallis in 2013, “i am forced to like quvenzhané wallis because she is a child right? okay fine.”",0
1445376305344630789,i really hate chrissy teigen,"In October of 2020, the Chrissy Teigen backlash began to simmer. That month, Teigen suffered a stillbirth, one she announced publicly with black-and-white photos of herself in the throes of grief. Some onlookers jeered at the photos, arguing that they reduced a personal tragedy to a tacky bid for attention. “Chrissy Teigen is so distraught over her miscarriage that she took the time to pose for a photo of herself crying, in black and white for dramatic effect, then shared that photo with the world along with her words. Stop it,” said one commenter.",0
1445376305344630789,i really hate chrissy teigen,"A counter-backlash eventually emerged in that case, with multiple outlets arguing that taking photographs can be an essential part of the grieving process for the parents of stillborn children and that Teigen’s public vulnerability could lessen the stigma surrounding pregnancy loss. Teigen herself turned the whole incident into the fodder for a raw and vulnerable Medium post later that month.",0
1445376305344630789,i really hate chrissy teigen,"“I cannot express how little I care that you hate the photos,” Teigen wrote. “How little I care that it’s something you wouldn’t have done. I lived it, I chose to do it, and more than anything, these photos aren’t for anyone but the people who have lived this or are curious enough to wonder what something like this is like. These photos are only for the people who need them. The thoughts of others do not matter to me.”",0

1445376305344630789,i really hate chrissy teigen,"Teigen is well aware of how cancellation works on Twitter. In 2020, she was central to the cancellation of food writer Alison Roman, who lost her New York Times column and (Teigen-produced) cooking show after criticizing Teigen and Marie Kondo in an interview for “selling out” with their product lines. Teigen publicly announced her hurt feelings, and the Alison Roman backlash took off.",0

Eventually, I realized that once the relatable ‘snarky girl who didn’t care’ became a pretty successful cookbook author and had more power in the industry, I couldn’t just say whatever the fuck I wanted. The more we grow, the more we get those wakeup calls.”",0
1445376305344630789,i really hate chrissy teigen,"So Teigen could see her cancellation coming.

Those Farrah Abraham tweets from 2013 that made the rounds in Nicki Swift’s 2017 video are now circulating again.",0
1445376305344630789,i really hate chrissy teigen,"Teigen’s reputation-damaging tweets all share a certain essential DNA. They are all tweets mocking girls and femmes whom the pop culture of the late ’00s and early ’10s had made it clear were fair game for mockery: people who read as girls (Stodden did not come out as nonbinary until 2021), and whom the culture at large considered to be too trashy, too slutty, too showy. Girly, but not in the right way. (Not that there was a right way.)",0
1445376305344630789,i really hate chrissy teigen,"What Teigen said on Twitter about and to those people was genuinely horrible, and it is clear that she targeted them because pop culture had given her permission to do so. Even outlets like Jezebel, “a supposedly feminist website,” were mocking Stodden in 2012. Doing so was part of the snarky ethos that defined Jezebel and its more famous cousin, Gawker.",0
1445376305344630789,i really hate chrissy teigen,"So in the early ’10s, these tweets didn’t hurt Teigen. Instead, they were part of what made her seem real and funny. Then, as now, Twitter rewarded cruelty, as long as it was directed at those the in-group considered to be “the right people.” But then, unlike now, “the right people” could include teenagers trapped in abusive relationships with adults.",0

I won’t say anything about her appearance. I was critical in the past, but like all people including me, she has good and bad pics.

1445376305344630789,i really hate chrissy teigen,I really don’t understand Chrissy’s popularity who is only really relevant because of her husband (John Legend). I honestly don’t get the media fascination with them and I find both extremely overrated. There are more talented and important people that deserve the attention that they easily receive for doing nothing (John is a singer but his music is not all of that) but what annoys me the most about them is that they carry themselves as self-important as if their opinions and perspectives should be held on a pedestal (and everyone should sit down and listen) They always have trivial commentary on a major or controversial news story in pop culture when no one asked for their opinion. My thing is this…if you want to be seen as more than just a “celebrity” and you dabbled into politics or other areas (that is out of your scope or competence) then you should be prepared for the consequences or reaction.

I also notice in her crappy post, she didn’t put Samoa cookies which in my opinion are the best ever! The mint ones are good too. I guess taste is subjective though. I hate the whiny singing of her husband. GS cookies are for a good cause and it’s sad she wants to bring down young girls.

I get that no one in Hollywood likes Trump but there was a tweet she fired off to him directly awhile back that was so rude. I don’t think you necessarily have to like the president but you should show respect for the office. When all these celebrities get up on their high horse about Trump they don’t get it that it makes our whole country look bad when they are posting stuff on social media. I think it weakens how we look. I think it sends the message to other countries that our own citizens don’t respect the White House so feel free to do whatever you want to us. No matter how bad our president is (he might not be good but he’s 1000 times better than dictatorships in other countries and we are enjoying freedom and not running for our lives) I think openly disrespecting the office is low class and just not wise.,0

Many ethics experts expressed sharp disapproval of the arrangement, including a former head of the Office of Government Ethics, Walter Shaub, who described the sums of money involved as “absolutely appalling.” So far, right-leaning outlets that devoted less attention to the ethical issues raised by the activities of Trump’s relatives have had a field day with the Hunter Biden story. Interest in his activities, meanwhile, has been relatively muted on the left. That may be changing. Along with new evidence that at least some of the alleged laptop material is genuine — as well as other emerging evidence about the deals family members have sought or received from people with an interest in influencing Biden — the bipartisan outcry over the painting venture suggests that the Hunter Biden issue is not going away, and that liberals may increasingly tune in. After all, concerns about money influencing politics have traditionally animated liberals more than conservatives. In fact, one of the most scathing critiques of Biden came during the Democratic primary, from the progressive reformer and Bernie Sanders surrogate Zephyr Teachout, who authored an op-ed for the Guardian accusing Biden of having a “corruption problem” (the column prompted Sanders to apologize to his former Senate colleague). And with his father in office, Hunter Biden’s activities no longer bear on an electoral choice between Biden and Trump. Instead, they threaten to complicate the White House’s efforts to position Biden as a global anti-corruption crusader, along with its contention that “we have the highest ethical standards of any administration in history.” It is impossible for the public to know everything that goes on inside a government office, let alone inside a family, especially one as tight knit as the Bidens.

As part of the effort, the then-vice president advocated for the measure in a meeting with Mitch McConnell, according to the oil company executive who sponsored the lobbying push. have not been implicated in any of the crimes, several of their business associates have been convicted on federal corruption or fraud charges over the past decade and a half. Most recently, in late 2020, a federal appeals court reinstated the conviction of Devon Archer — the former Hunter Biden business partner who facilitated his Burisma work — on fraud charges related to a bond issuance scheme. In 2017, Hunter and James Biden began seriously pursuing a business partnership with Ye Jianming, founder of the Chinese energy company CEFC. Ye enlisted Hunter Biden to provide legal representation to one of his lieutenants, Patrick Ho, who was facing legal problems in the U.S. Ho was subsequently convicted in federal court of bribing government officials in Africa. Biden Inc.: Over his decades in office, ‘Middle-Class Joe’s’ family fortunes have closely tracked his political career. Years earlier, around the time of Biden’s second presidential campaign in 2007, James Biden planned to launch an international law and lobbying shop to be called Patterson, Balducci and Biden. The plan was cut short when his partners, Timothy Balducci and Steve Patterson, were arrested by the FBI, and later convicted, over their unrelated efforts to bribe a Mississippi judge. Meanwhile, an associate of Patterson’s and Balducci’s, Joey Langston, pleaded guilty in federal court to his own role in a scheme to illicitly influence another judge. Several years later, Langston and James Biden went into business together, according to corporate records and an investigation by ProPublica. The pair worked with a company called Trina Health, which offered a controversial diabetes treatment. But the company’s founder, G. Ford Gilbert, pleaded guilty to federal bribery charges in 2019 following a corruption scandal in Alabama. Neither Langston nor James Biden have responded to questions seeking more detail about the nature of their involvement with Trina. As the 2020 election kicked into gear, Trump, Giuliani and their associates launched their failed attempt to paint the Bidens as corrupt. They tried to spin a narrative in which Joe Biden’s successful efforts to force the ouster of Ukraine’s top prosecutor were undertaken in order to derail investigations that could be harmful to Burisma or Zlochevsky. There were key holes in their case: For one thing, U.S. allies, including the World Bank and the European Union, supported the prosecutor’s dismissal. In fact, one complaint from the Western powers was that the prosecutor had not been pursuing Zlochevsky aggressively enough. A bipartisan group of U.S. senators had also been calling for reform of the prosecutor’s office. In the end, Trump’s efforts backfired. He was caught pressuring Ukraine’s president to investigate the Bidens while his administration withheld military aid from the country. That gambit provoked Trump’s impeachment, rather than Biden’s downfall.",0

Was there an informal encounter at this dinner? The Washington Post article confirms that Biden stopped by the dinner in question, but casts doubt on the idea that Pozharskyi was present, despite an alleged email listing a “Vadym” on the guest list. In the article, dinner attendee Rick Leach, then-president of the non-profit World Food Program USA, is quoted at length but does not actually address whether Pozharskyi attended. Leach told POLITICO he is unsure whether Pozharskyi was at the dinner, but that he considers it unlikely. “I don’t think so,” he said. “I don’t remember that name. I don’t remember that person at all.” Leach said that other than the two Bidens and a Greek Orthodox Church official, he could not recall the identities of any of the dozen or so people present during the dinner. He declined to say whether he has any emails from the time that might shed light on the identities of the other attendees. Pozharskyi did not respond to requests for comment for the book. Neither Joe Biden nor Hunter Biden have addressed on the record whether Joe Biden has ever met the Burisma representative. An encounter would not be the only one Pozharskyi ever had with a top U.S. official. In 2017 and 2018, Trump’s then-special envoy to Ukraine, Kurt Volker, met with Pozharskyi at events sponsored by the Atlantic Council, a Washington think tank, according to the Associated Press. But confirmation of such an encounter could renew uncomfortable scrutiny of Hunter Biden’s Burisma work and the role his connections to his powerful father have played in his business ventures. Even as attention has shifted to Hunter Biden’s painting, these earlier episodes remain murky. Until they are fully aired out, they threaten to undermine the White House push to take on global corruption and restore public faith in the executive branch. “Hiding the ball,” as Clark said of the White House approach to the painting venture, “is not the way to protect the public trust.”",0

I’m not even sure if that’s really his true thoughts, or if someone is just writing them, and he’s agreeing, because he definitely has a some kind of mental decline to the point he’s not competent enough to handle the job he has!

He is vehemently against our 2nd amendment by perverting it into an issue about hunting & pursuing things like a ban on so called “assault weapons” & magazine capacity restrictions. He claims he’s not taking anyone’s guns BUT what he wants to do is force you to either surrender your firearm (if deemed an assault weapon) or pay $200 per firearm to the government under a reinterpretation of gun laws of the past (1934,1968, 1986 etc) & have each registered with the government. His Vice President is open to the idea of reparations which would absolutely spark another civil war. Biden himself isn’t all there mentally & I fear any foreign crisis we face would need to be delegated further down the command chain for a decision on how to proceed. He says he wants unity but also was evasive about Supreme Court packing, & he has signed a flurry of executive actions since taking office. As a Libertarian leaning Independent I agree with him actually on issues of personal liberty, women’s rights, gay rights, etc BUT what he is going to do is simply the bidding of the far left socialist democratic machine who wishes to impose equal outcomes rather than equal opportunity upon the American people. Anyone with a bit of common sense or understanding of things like economics, game theory, psychology, etc will understand that not only is this impossible BUT the attempt to impose it will cause not only economic destruction, but may very well lead to a hot civil war. Barack Obama was most likely the last Democrat presidential candidate I will ever vote for in my lifetime based on the party’s current platform. Biden isn’t in this for us, it’s been a nearly half century pursuit of his to become president & when he sadly lost his son Beau in 2015 to brain cancer, I believe his son had encouraged him to run for president (for a 3rd time in his lifetime). I respect & understand him being a family man, I have a daughter myself & we all have parents. I don’t think he’s evil, but I do think he is very unintelligent (I don’t care where he went to school), & I absolutely am sickened by his disrespect for our 2nd amendment. He may not take your guns, but he sure wants to limit your ability to legally buy certain weapons in the future & that to me is equally unacceptable.",0

The way he curries favor with others, the way he gets rid of those in office who do not conform to his ideas of loyalty, the way that he conflates the office if presidency with himself, the way he had used the office if president to direct money into his family business, the way he has intentionally used his presidential powers to try to manipulate elections, the way he has intentionally used his bully pulpit to try and injure businesses that he personally dislikes - how do you corrupt that?

1445331458424557570,Newt Gingrich is gay for John Monds,"It’s a remarkable coincidence that Newt Gingrich’s latest career move was announced Wednesday morning, moments before the Supreme Court struck down his most consequential legislative victory in the culture wars. The pictures of Gingrich, just given top billing as the voice “on the right” of CNN’s revived shoutfest “Crossfire,” brought back a flood of recollections about the societal and political situation 17 years ago, when the star-crossed Defense of Marriage Act was written. Those memories help explain why such a sweeping measure made its way into the federal law books so relatively easily back then and why such a heavy federal stamp of disapproval on an entire category of people has no chance of enactment now. In the spring of 1996, the Georgian was at the height of his power as the first Republican speaker of the House in four decades. But the “Contract With America,” on which the GOP won control in the previous election, had little to say about hot-button social issues beyond a call to revamp the welfare system, which was actually a goal of both Gingrich and President Bill Clinton. That bill was on the cusp of clearing in an election-year session shaping up to be surprisingly more about collaboration than confrontation. This wasn’t sitting well with the still small but rhetorically forceful group of Republicans at the Capitol who viewed protecting “traditional values” as their top priority. Nor did it meet with the growing number of their supporters in well-funded outside groups on the right.",0
1445331458424557570,Newt Gingrich is gay for John Monds,"These conservative forces decided their cause would be legislation to discourage same-sex marriages, mainly by denying all manner of federal benefits to legally married gay couples. It didn’t matter to them that the phenomenon they wanted to eliminate didn’t yet exist anywhere in the United States. Nor were they slowed by the notion they were proposing something the GOP was against at its core — federal intervention into matters that were the exclusive province of the states. The political arguments, advanced by Gingrich as forcefully as anyone, readily carried the day. Pushing the bill in the heart of campaign season, they reckoned, would guarantee an easy win in a Congress where the gay rights lobby wasn’t much of a force (yet), and when Democrats in close races would oppose the measure at considerable peril. And, Gingrich and his forces strategized, their effort would raise the GOP millions in donations, rally cultural conservatives in swing states to support presidential challenger Bob Dole, and drive an awkward wedge between Clinton and his gay supporters. Their under-the-Dome predictions were correct: The bill cleared four months after its introduction, unthinkable speed for a high-profile domestic policy proposal now. And it won with support from two-thirds of the Democrats in both the House and Senate along with every Republican except one. The electoral dividends Gingrich and other GOP leaders forecast, however, never came to pass. All the Democrats who voted against it were liberals in safe seats. Polling by Gallup found 68 percent of Americans opposed to legalizing gay marriage and only 27 percent in favor, so there weren’t many swing voters to motivate. Clinton promised to sign the bill early on, civil rights groups all agreed to look the other way rather than complicate his re-election race by complaining, and he won more decisively than the first time.",0
1445331458424557570,Newt Gingrich is gay for John Monds,"As a way to freeze public opinion or stem a societal shift, DOMA of course proved to be a colossal failure long before the court’s 5-4 decision Wednesday declaring it unconstitutional. Since last fall, Gallup has twice found a solid 53 percent majority support for same-sex couples getting married. A majority of the Senate, three of them Republicans, agrees with the public. Same-sex marriage is now legal in 13 states and the District of Columbia, where 30 percent of Americans live. There were three openly gay men in the House the year DOMA became law. Now there’s a lesbian senator and five openly gay men and a bisexual woman in the House. Clinton himself now says the court was right to throw out the law he signed.

1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"The short, 18-second clip doesn't show any new footage of the pop star, but it does feature some very revealing audio. The audio is a previously leaked voicemail Spears left for a lawyer way back in January of 2009 (one year into her conservatorship). ""Hi, my name is Britney Spears, I called you earlier. I'm calling again because I just wanted to make sure that during the process of eliminating the conservatorship..."" The message stops there, but it makes it crystal clear that Spears has been actively fighting to end the conservatorship for over a decade. And it's heartbreaking to think of how long she's been ignored, silenced, and dismissed by her own lawyers and the people around her.",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"Following the premiere of the NYT's documentary, Framing Britney Spears, this summer, Spears' conservatorship has been a hot topic of public scrutiny and debate. The documentary increased attention on the #FreeBritney movement, giving it more legitimacy, and helped shine a spotlight on what would become Spears' explosive court testimony in June, in which she formally asked for the conservatorship to be ended without any psychological evaluation. However, the doc did leave fans with a lot of questions about the legalities of Spears' conservatorship, what happened behind-the-scenes, and the nature of her relationship with her father.",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"Based on the first tease for Netflix's Britney vs. Spears, it certainly seems like those loose ends will be explored in this new documentary directed by Erin Lee Carr (Mommy Dead and Dearest, I Love You Now Die: The Commonwealth v. Michelle Carter). Not to mention, everything that has happened since Framing Britney Spears came out — including Spears' testimony, her new lawyer, and her father Jamie Spears' motion to remove himself from the conservatorship.",0

""It appears that Mr. Spears believes he can try to avoid accountability and justice,"" he said in a statement to NBC News after Jamie filed papers asking that Spears' conservatorship be re-evaluated. But, thanks to Rosengart's legal work, and this new documentary, it doesn't look like Jamie will be able to hide the truth much longer.",0

1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"In 2008, the same year that Britney Spears had been placed under a 5150 psychiatric hold after losing custody of her children amid a painful, tabloid-fueled public breakdown, a gaggle of Family Feud contestants took turns guessing at all the things she’d lost. Her hair? Ding! Her husband? Ding! Her sanity? Host John O’Hurley’s voice boomed with classic game show boisterousness as he shouted, “Has she lost her mind?!” Ding! Other answers included “Her Children” and “Weight”—to which O’Hurley replied, “I guess...”",0

1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"Available on Hulu following its debut on FX, Framing Britney Spears builds on the multiple robustly reported articles the Times has run over the years—each of which have lent gravitas to a fan effort that might otherwise have been written off—and is a handy primer for anyone who’s still not quite sure what cries to #FreeBritney actually mean. But its study of the singer’s life and career in the public eye feels rushed and even superficial at times. Despite the doc’s insistence that “to understand where Britney is now, we should understand how she got here,” the episode itself offers a cherry-picked biography—one that oversimplifies the many societal impulses that converged to dehumanize and torment a young celebrity in distress.",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"In analyzing how Spears came to be treated with such cruelty, Framing Britney Spears rightly dissects the misogyny she faced from just about everyone throughout her career—from the older men interviewing her with probing questions about her sex life and breasts during her teen years, to the interview in which Diane Sawyer reduced a 22-year-old Spears to tears in primetime by asking what she had “done” to break Justin Timberlake’s heart. (Sawyer also seemed to defend the then-first lady of Maryland for saying she’d shoot Spears if given the opportunity, telling the appalled singer, “It’s because of the example for kids and how hard it is to be a parent.”) We also witness the ways in which Timberlake was able to seize the narrative of his break-up with Spears, who got labeled the “school slut” after rumors emerged that she had cheated on the NSYNC singer with choreographer Wade Robson.",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"Misogyny certainly poisoned Spears’ relationship with celebrity, but Framing Britney’s examination of the horrible treatment hurled her way feels limited—reliant, above all, on the idea that misogyny is a fixed ideology. In reality, misogyny comes in different flavors, depending on other factors including but certainly not limited to a woman’s race, social class, gender expression, and weight. To understand how Spears “got here,” her womanhood is just one of several facets of her identity one must unpack.",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"For instance: How can we talk about the dehumanization of Britney Spears if we never address how her image morphed from that of a darling “small-town girl” from the South, to that of a backwards “white-trash” redneck who deserved no sympathy from the public?",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"As with any project concerning Spears, Framing Britney doesn’t waste much time before reminding us all that she hails from the modest town of Kentwood, Louisiana. Overhead shots of the Kentwood water tower, farmland, and a church steeple play like a screen-saver as the bubbly, heavily accented Felicia Culotta—Spears’ assistant and chaperone for years—explains the town’s “hospitable and humble” nature. Kentwood was central to Spears’ public image from her early years; her parents, James (AKA “Jamie”) and Lynne Spears, famously scraped by to fund their eldest daughter’s career, even as the former’s contracting business collapsed.",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"In Spears, America had found yet another talented youngster to pluck from poverty and catapult into the glitzy, glamorous world of celebrity. But even as Spears’ Southern, working-class background initially allowed her to flourish as the exemplar of the American dream, the singer’s subsequent refusal to play by a very specific set of rules earned her several denigrating labels, many of which seemed to be attached to lower-income communities within the Bible Belt.",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"Jennifer Musial, assistant professor of women’s and gender studies at New Jersey City University, offers a compelling theory as to how this happened. “Celebrity is meant to elevate rural white Southerners,” she writes, “and here ‘elevate’ means to save from their perceived ‘backwardness.’ Spears failed to be the ‘right’ kind of Southerner that we (are supposed to) root for.”",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"“If celebrity is the perfect marriage between neoliberal capitalism and the American Dream because it promises anything is possible, then pop star Britney Spears exposes the fissures of an idealized system,” Musial writes. “Spears shows us that not everyone can be transformed and that public shaming awaits those whose behavior betrays what is expected of affluent white women.”",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"From the release of “...Baby One More Time” and its Catholic schoolgirl-themed video in 1998 onward, Spears faced a relentless barrage of criticism and concern trolling—but rather than cover her midriff or tone down her videos, the singer did the opposite. In 2001, she released the steamy video for “I’m a Slave 4 U” and danced at the MTV Video Music Awards draped in a giant anaconda and not much else. That she dared to do so while still claiming to be a virgin was too much for many apoplectic adults at the time to handle.",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"As Musial notes, Spears often invoked Kentwood as a reason for her provocative fashions. In Heart-to-Heart, which Spears co-wrote with her mother in 2000, the singer writes, “The crop tops and hip huggers I wore in some of my videos were the kind of clothes we used to wear in Kentwood (it can be scorching during the summer, so the barer the better!), and I’m real comfortable dancing in them.”",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"The public wasn’t necessarily convinced, but Spears’ power over her captive public was undeniable—and derived, at least in part, from a Lolita image that she and her management sculpted flawlessly for years.

1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"It’s difficult to discern why Framing Britney Spears skips straight from Spears’ break-up with Timberlake in 2002 to her engagement to Federline two years later. In doing so, the doc ignores multiple relationships that ignited the public derision toward her in earnest—like her brief dalliance with her back-up dancer, Columbus Short, and her infamously brief marriage to childhood friend Jason Alexander (not of Seinfeld fame) in 2003. It was right around when Spears married Alexander, Musial notes, that more and more publications began to slap Spears with the label “white trash”—especially after reports emerged that she’d worn a baseball cap and ripped jeans down the aisle.",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"Then came Federline, whom Spears married in 2004 after three months of courtship. Hitching her wagon to a white dancer with cornrows, who’d only just separated from the mother of his two children (one of whom was still in utero), did little to alleviate the scrutiny on Spears and her perceived “trashiness.” The singer’s make-out sessions with Federline on their balcony, one of which included Spears performatively grabbing her beau’s crotch for the hordes of tireless cameras below, were strewn across tabloids as proof of the couple’s tastelessness.",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"As Vanessa Grigoriadis put it in Rolling Stone in 2008, “Federline gave Britney license to fully embrace her white-trash side—walking into gas-station restrooms barefoot, dumping ashtrays out hotel windows, wearing novelty tees like I’m a virgin, but this is an old shirt and, most notably, not strapping the kids into car seats.”",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"The classist labels thrown at Spears furthered her tabloid-driven and, yes, deeply sexist dehumanization—and things only got worse when she announced her pregnancy.

1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"Until her pregnancy, Spears had successfully leveraged America’s collective worship of her impossible figure to maintain control over her broader career and public image—but as late-night shows and tabloids alike cruelly mocked the singer’s weight gain, that power began to dissolve. (After all, is there anything this country loves more than telling mothers, especially those associated with lower-income backgrounds, how to raise their kids?)",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"Rumors swirled that Spears was drinking and smoking throughout her pregnancy, allegations that she denied. Various publications littered their pages with photos of Spears eating burgers and Cheetos, with close-ups of the stains on her shirt and the acne on her skin—a maneuver used to imply that she lacked proper discipline. And once Spears gave birth, things only got worse after she was photographed driving with her infant son on her lap and, on another occasion, tripping with him in her arms and a glass of water in her hand.",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"Being watched so closely, and so unforgivingly, for so long took a visible toll on Spears, whose 2006 interview with Matt Lauer, also seen in Framing Britney, is painful to watch. At one point, as seen in the doc, Lauer asks Spears, “What do you think it will take to get the paparazzi to leave you alone?” She begins to cry, repeating the words, “I don’t know.”",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"But another moment unseen in the documentary is, perhaps, even more illuminating. Lauer eventually asks Spears how her image went from “this great, young thing from the South” to that of a “redneck.”",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"“I think that’s just cruel, you know?” Spears replied. “... I feel like when you put labels on people like that... At the end of the day, they’re just words. And that’s what I have to look at them as. You have to be really strong and just be like, ‘If that’s what you wanna say, then, you know, OK.’” She also addressed the driving incident, saying that her father had done the same with her when she was young. “I’d sit in his lap and drive,” she said. “We’re country.”",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"Despite Spears’ candor, and her visible emotional struggle, the response to the interview was cruel—and, once again, steeped in classist resentment. A sample, from Robin Givhan of The Washington Post:",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"“The Britney Spears interview on NBC’s Dateline offered several lessons worth noting, the most significant of which is to remove large wads of gum from one’s mouth before engaging in a conversation,” Givhan wrote, adding later, “It is also best not to wear a denim miniskirt so short that when seated it practically disappears beneath the protuberance of one’s pregnant belly, producing an image that is more gynecological than fashionable. Instead of making a statement about the sexiness of impending motherhood, it suggests that the mother-to-be appears to be unfamiliar with the usefulness of a full-length mirror and the term ‘ho-gear.’”",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"The piece, which at one point says Spears looked like a “stereotypical hick,” grants that her tearful plea to be left alone was compelling, but adds that it was “hard to concentrate” on her emotional torment because of her “over-bleached and uncombed” hair and loud make-up: “If the point of the interview was to curry sympathy and concern from viewers, then Spears reached for a costume to make her pitch.”",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"The tumult that would follow Spears’s Lauer interview has been well documented—a divorce from Federline in 2006, soon after the birth of their second son Jayden James months earlier; partying with Paris Hilton; losing custody of her children; multiple stints in rehabilitation centers; and a disastrous 2007 MTV VMAs performance of “Gimme More”—which prompted more body-shaming—a 5150 psychiatric hold, and eventually, the conservatorship. (In 2007, Spears’ younger sister, Jamie Lynn, announced her own pregnancy at the age of 16, which only intensified the public’s scrutiny toward the family.)",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"In addition to its rushed biography, Framing Britney Spears is also peculiarly simplistic in describing conservatorship as typical among the elderly—which ignores the number of disabled people who are also subject to guardianship. This, too, feels like a missed opportunity to contextualize Spears’ struggle within that of the state’s dehumanization of disabled people.",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"Speaking with The Daily Beast last August, Zoe Brennan-Krohn, staff attorney with the ACLU’s Disability Rights Project, noted it’s much easier to get in a conservatorship than it is to get out of one. “There’s an inherent harm in stripping someone of their civil rights and liberties, and there is a signaling harm in telling a person, ‘You are not smart enough, trustworthy enough, healthy enough, well enough, to direct your own life,’” she explained.",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"Spears and her family have never disclosed a formal diagnosis for the singer, who has discussed dealing with anxiety in the past but declined to say much more about her mental health. But there’s also no need to speculate in order to make the comparison. As IndieWire’s Kristen Lopez points out in a recent piece addressing the documentary’s choice to ignore the disability community, “when you factor in the more nefarious ways conservatorships control a person’s medical and, especially, sexual and reproductive health, it’s reminiscent of the numerous ways those with disabilities have been controlled and prohibited from being considered actual people.”",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"One could argue that Framing Britney’s simplifications are largely a factor of runtime. As the sixth episode in The New York Times Presents’ second season, it is also the longest entry so far, clocking in at around 74 minutes. For those who simply want to understand what all the #FreeBritney fuss is about, the documentary is undeniably useful, but its investment in brevity squanders the opportunity to say anything deeper with its subject’s story—a biography that speaks, in so many ways, to the tensions that still underpin our society, even if celebrity reporting has gotten a little more polite. In truth, even with more time, it will probably be impossible for anyone to properly tell Spears’ story without the participation of the Princess of Pop herself. Either way, if there’s anyone whose story merits a deeper, more complex approach, it’s Britney, bitch.",0

1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"The V.M.A.’s had been Britney’s to lose since the late 90s. Not as a nominee, though as that too. As a performer. She’d knocked ’em dead, deader, deadest for years: from the homeroom she’d hijacked in “… Baby One More Time” (1999) to the mock striptease she’d delivered in “(I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction” (2000), to the live python she’d let writhe around her neck in “I’m a Slave 4 U” (2001), to the kiss she, the dewy young bride in white go-go boots, laid on her groom, a très studly looking Madonna, in the “Like a Virgin”/“Hollywood” hybrid (2003).",0

In previous years, she’d costumed herself in as little as F.C.C. regulations permitted, revealing a body confined to the strictest of diets, subjected to the most rigorous of workouts. In other words, though she was exposed, she wasn’t. Now, however, she was truly baring all. Britney refused the wig Ken Pavés had made her, necessary because she’d taken an electric razor to her head seven months prior, allowing only a few hairpieces to be hastily glued on before showtime. Refused, as well, a corset dress, choosing instead a spangled bra-and-panty set. And while by no stretch heavy, she was in less than perfect condition. Standing in front of the crowd without her armor plate of taut, tawny muscle, she appeared unnervingly soft, undefended, vulnerable.",0

As references go, it’s pointed, and, by making it, Britney was simultaneously denying a kinship and claiming one.",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"First, the kinship she was denying. Britney had been compared to Madonna since breaking through, almost a decade before. The resemblance was obvious—there were the dance moves; there was the controversy. It was also false.",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"Madonna had trained as a dancer, but, in truth, she wasn’t much of one. She was competent, could do the steps, sure. Her body held back, though. And for all her bumping and grinding, there was a marked lack of sensuality in her movements. (You think I’m wrong, take another look. Watch footage of her on the “Blond Ambition” tour, say, or the “Re-Invention.” She could be running an aerobics class from the stage.) Britney, in contrast, was a born dancer. A born hedonist, too, it would appear. Peach-ripe and unthinkingly carnal, she turned the whole world on, her style as fluid and easy and lush as Madonna’s was tight and tense and held in.",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"And both Madonna and Britney attracted controversy, but by opposite means. Madonna’s behavior wasn’t shocking so much as “shocking”: the burning crosses, the simulated erotic acts with herself/a woman/an Evian bottle—all of it contrived and more than a little self-serious. (Madonna unquestionably had a kind of genius. It wasn’t an artist’s, though; it was an advertiser’s. She was at once the hawker of the product and the product being hawked.) Britney, on the other hand, just couldn’t seem to help herself, compelling our fascination by doing what came naturally. That same-sex kiss at the 2003 V.M.A.’s, for example, wouldn’t have caused the planet to lose its mind if Britney hadn’t opened her mouth as she leaned in.",0

Both Elvis and Britney hit it big young, Elvis just a few years out of high school when he took over the charts, Britney still in it when she did the same. Both were Southern, born in Mississippi. Both were poor, Elvis’s father a former sharecropper and ex-jailbird; Britney’s a building contractor who went on benders, disappearing for days at a stretch. And the ease with which people from New York or L.A. got snotty when talking about the two—Time, in its review of Elvis’s first film, described his voice as “cornmeal mush”; Rolling Stone, in its first cover story of Britney, noted her “eleventh-grade education” and insistence on “cleav[ing] to the Baptist faith”—is symptomatic of the ease with which coastal America gets snotty generally when talking about those who are white, underclass, and from below the Mason-Dixon Line, the only minority group that it’s still socially acceptable to denigrate.",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"And those are just the surface similarities, the superficial stuff. Where Elvis and Britney most profoundly mirror one another is in their deeply divided American souls. Elvis might have come off as a good-for-nothing hoodlum with a twisted lip and pimp-punk clothes, who glided through the hot Memphis nights in a tricked-out Cadillac of labia-pink, cruising for girls, for trouble, for kicks, who never apologized and never, ever looked back. But he was also the boy whose fondest hope was to become a gospel singer, whose best friend was his mother, who just wanted to be your teddy bear and Nixon’s narcotics officer.",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"As far as schizo personas go, though, Britney’s takes the cake. Her first “Ooh-bay-bah-bay-bah” slid into our collective ear like a tongue, in the fall of 1998, when her debut single was released by Jive Records. She was 16. An American Dream that was a wet dream, a porn queen in the guise of a teen queen. And, at an instinctive level, she understood this, understood the nature of her appeal, and played it up, dramatized it. The schoolgirl theme of the “… Baby One More Time” video, as much a sensation as the song itself, was hers. Said Britney to Rolling Stone, “[The director and record label] had this really bizarre video idea, this animated Power Ranger-y thing…. I had this idea where we’re in school and bored … and we have Catholic uniforms on.”",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"And yet she was, at the same time, a regular kid from a small town who went to homecoming and church and believed in abstinence until marriage, so easy to relate to you practically were her. She even looked like you. Better, obviously, but not by leaps and bounds, her prettiness commonplace. You could find half a dozen of her wandering the food court of any shopping mall in America. She was an extreme case: extremely special, extremely nothing special.",0

Our hypocrisy demanded that she play dumb so that we didn’t have to acknowledge, even to ourselves, our impermissible thoughts. In short, her persona was schizo out of necessity.",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"Early on in her career, a pattern was established: the rock-’em-sock-’em “… Baby One More Time,” with its S&M overtones, was followed by the sticky-icky “Sometimes”; “Oops! … I Did It Again,” about stomping on tender male hearts for the fun of hearing them go squish, was followed by “Lucky,” about a starlet adored by millions but—boo-hoo—lonely on the inside; and so on and so forth.",0

She talked with her mouth, and what she said was soft, flat, polite, girlish, self-effacing, devoid of nuance or interest or force. And she talked with her body, and what she said was assertive, aggressive, teasing, taunting, cruel verging on sadistic, and full of raw female power. The second voice was the louder and more insistent, and it tended to drown out the first, though not always and never entirely.

Britney, now in her mid-20s, ended her marriage to former backup dancer Kevin Federline, the father of her two small boys, via text, reportedly. That was the moment the center didn’t just fail to hold, it went totally and spectacularly blooey.

As already noted, Britney that night was performing “Gimme More,” her latest single, which happened to be her best yet. “Gimme More,” with its dead-eyed opening, “It’s Britney, bitch,” an assertion of self that also set us, her audience, straight in terms of our relation to that self—we weren’t her equals; no, we were her worshippers, her dogs, her fans, her bitches—was a kind of coming-out. She was done pandering to us, to our fragile egos and Victorian attitudes toward women and sex. No longer was she willing to pretend she was just an ordinary girl in extraordinary circumstances. She might have believed that once, but she didn’t anymore and hadn’t for a while. Her talent, her ambition, her verve, her daring, the sheer wild and wicked thrill of how she looked and sounded and moved had gotten an entire generation jumping and turned her into the last big star of the 20th century, the first big millennial star, and, for the past nine years, the biggest star in the Western world. The idea that we could understand her or identify with her was ludicrous, obscene. Her spoken language and body language now matched. And though in the song it was us demanding that Britney “gimme more,” “gimme more” reflected, as well, her own appetite, which was gargantuan, unappeasable: she was going to eat us alive, and we were going to let her.",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"Nor when she began her routine was she quite the Britney of old. Her usual dancing style was to attack a song, take it over. But not this time. There was a languorousness to her movements, a dreaminess, a drugginess, frankly. (A few weeks later, a judge would declare her a “habitual, frequent and continuous” user.) And though she was lip-synching, she sounded, paradoxically, authentic—both soulful and raunchy. It was a moment of transformation. Of transcendence as well.",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"Those in the audience, industry insiders mainly, didn’t know how to take what they’d seen. Or, rather, they took it the wrong way. They treated it—and her—as a joke. (Said comedian Sarah Silverman as she walked onto the stage that Britney had just vacated, “Britney Spears, everyone. Wow … 25 years old and she’s already accomplished everything she’s going to accomplish in her life.”) They didn’t have the hipness or the wit to recognize that this ex-Mouseketeer and Star Search contestant, this pop tart, this cute little ass-shaking, money-making marionette, manipulated by her mother, her label, her handlers, had cut the strings, was seizing control by losing it. And, in so doing, had shown them all up, demonstrating that she was the true spirit of rock ’n’ roll.",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"An additional point: rock ’n’ rollers are, with a few notable exceptions, men. Rock ’n’ roll is a male thing because rock ’n’ roll is a dick thing. Only apparently not. Britney, on that night, was as raw and elemental and dangerous and reckless as any strutting, thrusting, sneering boy, while remaining ultra femme. Whatever the female equivalent of cocksure is, she’d found it. Proved that girls can do it, too, and better.",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"A second additional point: I’m being unfair. There were people who got it, got her. Writer-director Harmony Korine, for one. His original and electrifying neon noir, Spring Breakers (2012), featured a sequence in which James Franco, looking like Kevin Federline and acting like Charles Manson, sat at a white baby grand and tenderly serenaded his trio of gun-toting, ski-mask-wearing, barely legal girlfriends with Britney’s 2003 ballad, “Everytime.” She was the star of that movie even if she never physically appeared in it.",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"Britney didn’t cool it after the V.M.A.’s; she jacked it up, if anything. Post, she’d drag race with the photographers following her 24-7, leading them on perilous chases along Mulholland, Coldwater Canyon, the P.C.H. And when that particular set of fun and games ceased to amuse, she’d try another, reportedly jumping out of her car and into that of Adnan Ghalib, the smoking-est guy on her tail, instructing him to take her to the Peninsula hotel. (How like Britney to turn around and seduce her stalker, one of the men ruining her life and giving it meaning, whose attentions she shunned and craved, her tormentor-savior. To see that the pursuit of a star by a paparazzo was a twisted version of romantic pursuit, a grotesque form of love and courtship. Lady Gaga, Madonna’s true child, might write a clever song about a star and a paparazzo doing it; Britney just did it.) She’d go on a two A.M. shopping spree in menstrual-blood-stained undies. She’d lose, at least temporarily, custody of her sons. It became difficult to imagine her story ending any other way than in death—by drugs, by car, by fame itself.",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"Instead it ended like this: on January 3, 2008, Britney was strapped to a gurney and shoved into the back of a Cedars-Sinai-bound ambulance, laughing as she cried, middle finger raised in Byronic defiance as the cameras popped and flashed and the sirens wailed like banshees. It was a moment of genuine derangement and tragedy, but it also had about it an air of mad poetry. A sex bomb had detonated, and the spectacle was mesmerizing, beautiful.",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"Soon after that night, a temporary conservatorship was put in place. (Temporary would be made permanent later that year.) And, all of a sudden, Britney’s story began to take on the contours and coloration of a sinister fairy tale. She was still our princess, but no longer the pop kind. Now she was the kind who was locked away in a tower, the key held by a wicked relation—the tower, in this case, being her Thousand Oaks mansion; the key, her conservatorship; the relation, her father, Jamie. Our only glimpses into the tower came from her Instagram posts, which we scanned obsessively, trying to glean clues, signs, hidden messages she might be sending us.",0

1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"Now back to Elvis, Britney’s spiritual father. Elvis was an American self-creation, a nobody who made himself into not just a somebody but a somebody known by everybody. Elvis had a turbulent relationship with the public, was desired and ridiculed, lionized and trivialized, loved and hated. (This volatility is, in my opinion, essential to the promotion of a lasting intimacy, an unbreakable bond, between a star and us. It’s necessary that the star experience high highs, of course, but it’s equally necessary that the star experience low lows, so that we have a sense of superiority to go along with a sense of inferiority. In other words, Fat Elvis is every bit as vital as Skinny.) Elvis was also a de facto suicide, which is why our feelings about him are unresolved, forever in flux. Our sinking suspicion is that we are to blame for what happened to him—we let him down, turned our backs, left him all alone—and, because he is no longer here, we can’t make it up to him. He is under our skin and on our conscience, the reason his fame doesn’t simply endure, it thrives. He lives even in death, haunts us still.",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"Britney, the pop-culture icon of our era, managed to avoid, by the grace of God, by the skin of her teeth, the fate of her predecessor. And yet, though she did not die in ’08, some version of her did, the version that was wild and scary and exciting and free—died or was killed. So, in a crucial sense, she shares Elvis’s fate. And she haunts us, too. Is every bit as lost to us as he is.",0

She jet black hair which highlighted nicely against her pale skin. Pop princess. Super star Diva. Self confessed slut. Marvellous. She was watching TV in shorts and a tight tee-shirt that showed off a few of her curves. Rats, she had a bra on dammit. No nipple peak. She glanced up at me and did a double take, noticing my ravishing good looks!",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"She made a little small talk, asking me my name etc and asking me to lay all the food out rather than just leave it on the trolley. I then noticed that it was a meal for two. And out of the bedroom at that point comes Britney Spears! What? Thought these two did not like each other. And where did Britney come from? I knew that Christina was staying here but Britney was a surprise. Christina introduced me to her more for her sake than mine I guess. Heck, I knew who it was.",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"She looked me over and smiled, her teeth, perfectly white. She was wearing a loose blouse and pants. I was a lot taller than she was so had a birds eye view as she leaned forward to shake hands with me. The loose fitting blouse fell open and I could see her tits sitting in a blue bra. The view from up top of her tits was magnificent. Britney was hot. She was about the same size as Christina. It was a great site to see them both together.",0

I reached into her collar and yanked down hard, tearing her tee shirt in half, leaving her perky tits sitting perfectly into a white half cup bra. She laughed and slipped her shorts off, her white thong showed off her body and ass nicely. She leaned forward, posing and her round ass cheeks were even more prominent now. She motioned me to bend over and I did. She gave me a quick kiss. ""You are about to live every living guys fantasy.""

From the very outset of her fame, the idea that Britney wouldn’t put it out there if she didn’t want us to look made her audience feel better about gawking at the exposed midriff of a 17-year-old girl. But the three-note opening hook of “...Baby One More Time,” the song that would launch her to an almost unfathomable level of closely studied celebrity, is ominous, oddly funereal for a teeny bopper pop hit. It posed a question: “Oh baby, baby, how was I supposed to know/That something wasn’t right here?”And with her introductory line as a solo pop star, Britney was already pushing back against the idea that she was asking for whatever her audience gave her.",0

From the vantage point afforded by 22 years of hindsight—including Britney’s much-photographed 2008 mental health crisis and a subsequent 12-year conservatorship which has left her with no more right to autonomy than a child—it’s clear that Britney’s celebrity has always been foundationally not right.",0

So many of Britney Spears’s live performances involve a team of dancers releasing Britney from a cage to writhe and dance to a catalog of songs that are largely focused on feeling alone in the spotlight.

She was America’s pop princess with a TV and Broadway career to boast by the time she turned 14, and I was only ever the crowned sovereign of my high school gymnasium and once given the title of Little Miss Black Bayou, which some older boys shortened to Miss Swamp Thing and would yell at me when I was in my front yard.",0

It was splashed across the pages of teen fashion magazines, speculated about in whispers among my classmates, praised by the youth minister at church. The “purity pledge” she’d taken was similar to a Wednesday night youth group meeting in the gymnasium of my church’s youth building, where we were asked to stand in front of our peers and promise Jesus we wouldn’t fuck until legally having signed a paper allowing us to do so. Women were born white roses, we were told, but every new sexual partner browned a petal; even one bruise blighted the flower and too many meant handing our future husbands a rotted, crumbling mess soiling the entire wedding bouquet.",0

I didn’t like the hand, but I did like the attention. That year my stepmother, yet another former southern queen of various realms, also began to suggest highlighting my naturally dark brown hair a bit closer to a blonde that might “suit me better,” though I understood what she meant: make me prettier, like Britney and the countless other Louisiana girls who looked just like her.

In one hand she holds a cotton candy-colored phone, in the other, she clutches a stuffed Teletubby. “Inside the heart, mind, and bedroom of a teen dream,” the cover copy promises. But writer Steven Daly used the opening paragraphs of the report to describe the exterior he was now allowed to openly fetishize—“Britney Spears extends a honeyed thigh across the length of the sofa,” he begins before launching into a delineation of her trademark blonde hair and “ample chest” that reads like a product description of something for sale in a catalog. But immediately after the sales pitch, Daly warns the reader, and by proxy himself, not to fall into the “carefully baited trap,” teased by Spears’s beauty, her body, and the Catholic schoolgirl setup of her video for “...Baby One More Time.” Daly implies Britney herself, much like the crop tops in her videos, was likely a scam, titillating but ultimately revealing nothing.",0

In the conclusion of the piece, Daly concludes he doesn’t know much more than he did when he started. Britney was a well-built catalog offering he couldn’t reverse engineer: “Whatever Britney Spears ends up ‘growing into,’ she stands today as the latest model of a classic product: the unneurotic pop star who performs her duties with vaudevillian pluck and spokesmodel charm.”",0

She symbolically lost her virginity for us at age 21 in the movie Crossroads and released a single literally declaring “I’m Not a Girl”—but lest she comes off as too old, parentheses tempered the statement with the caveat that she was also (Not Yet a Woman). Her media appearances too flirted with the dichotomy that she was old enough to be sexual but wasn’t really a bad girl at heart. There was the strange Colin Farrell fling covered breathlessly by the tabloids, with Spears tempering the rumors by coyly insisting that the two hadn’t done more than kiss. Then she kissed Madonna in a wedding dress during a performance at the VMAs in 2003, explaining later that she thought Madonna had been her husband in a past life.",0

Justin Timberlake told Barbara Walters that he knew from experience Britney Spears’s virginity pledge was just for show and released a video for a single, “Cry Me a River,” that implied their three-year relationship had ended because she cheated (a claim he regurgitates every time he has a new album to promote). Then Fred Durst would go on Howard Stern’s talk show and claim he’d had sex with Britney Spears. The 2003 film Love Actually makes a joke of the fact that so many men in the music industry suddenly had stories of their sexual encounters with Britney.

1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"I fell in love with barefoot gas station Britney. The tabloid frenzy around the “real” Britney suggested we had even more in common than I knew: a formerly celebrated Louisiana princess now rumored to have a violent alcoholic father and a bit of a drug problem. Sometime around the point when Britney publicly declared herself “Stronger than yesterday” with assurances that her loneliness wasn’t killing her anymore, I’d begun smoking, snorting, and swallowing anything that would make the remainder of a miserable childhood pass faster. A few months before my 18th birthday, my town crowned me its princess in that high school gymnasium. On my 18th, a bail bondsman and small-time drug dealer in his late twenties rented a hotel suite to throw me a party that I knew he was hoping would end in the consummation of my legality. After a lot of lines and vodka mixed with sugary soft drinks, I managed to escape that guy, though I heard another high school girl had slept with him after I left. A few months after that party, all the dark shit that I felt was chasing me caught up, and I shattered my face against the headrest of another friend’s car when she crashed into an embankment. The accident left me in a coma for two weeks, and when I woke up, half of my prize-winning face was liquified, a loose eye floated in the shards of a socket, an entire cheekbone had been lost to a biohazard bag discarded with the rest of the hospital waste alongside seven teeth pumped from a stomach additionally overwhelmed by several pints of swallowed blood, itself poisoned with alcohol and a bouquet of other substances. It took three years and over 20 surgeries to reconstruct something approximating a normal face, but I’d never be a honeyed approximation of Britney again. To add literal insult to actual injury, the small-town gossip mill meant that everyone who’d ever known me had heard all my secrets before I even woke up. “Make sure to keep your children close” the marquee sign of a local business warned as my mother drove me home from the hospital a month or so after the wreck.",0

1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"But Blackout is my favorite of her catalog. Britney is no longer singing about her loneliness killing her. She’s fucking furious. “It’s Britney, bitch,” she famously declares in the opening of “Gimme More,” prefacing an album where the electronic background music lends a dystopian feel to songs that are no longer passive pleas to be allowed to dance or elegies to sexy loneliness. “Wanna see crazy, we can show em,” she talks-sings in a song called “Freakshow,” part of a running thesis for the album which seems to declare “You can look, but stop bitching about what you see.”",0

At the time, the AP had at least 22 reporters covering Britney news, and pictures, generally of mundane events like her trips to the grocery store, accounted for 20 percent of paparazzi agencies’ total celebrity coverage in 2007, earning millions of dollars for paparazzi agencies. Meanwhile, the wounded subject at the heart of this industry was obviously scared, desperate, and in need of help. She’d lost custody of her children after a terrifying incident in which she barricaded herself with them in the bathroom of her Beverly Hills home, and she had parted ways with most of the team surrounding her since she was a teenager, including her parents. As Grigoriadis notes in her tragedy, Britney drove aimlessly around Los Angeles for the attention of the paparazzi and by extension, the public, offering soliloquies about her loneliness to photographers in a British accent. She was also mad as hell, furiously buzzing the blonde hair that made her famous into a trash pile on a barbershop floor and attacking a waiting paparazzo’s SUV window outside with an umbrella. Unfair as it was for me to root for Britney as some misplaced outlet for my own trauma, I wish she’d shattered that fucking window.",0

One confessed the conversation to me, but other men I saw every day had likely voted behind my back. When I heard the story, my first thought was of the old joke from my teenage years: “Britney Spears can’t sing. Titty, titty, titty. Ass, ass, ass.” When Britney angrily growled, “You want a piece of me,” it wasn’t a question; it was a statement about being whittled to nothing.",0

A small but dedicated team gathers outside the Los Angeles courthouse ahead of each new hearing in Britney’s ongoing conservatorship and scans her Instagram for clues that she hears them and supports their mission. Her father, some Free Britney truthers believe, collaborated with various Los Angeles powers that be in order to have Britney declared unfit so that he could be ready with conservatorship paperwork. Andrew Gallery, a photographer who worked closely with Spears, claims he was let out of an NDA and can now freely allege that she told him the only reason she’d allowed the conservatorship to go on uncontested was because she’d been warned her children would be taken away if she attempted to change the terms. A Change.org petition called “Britney Spears: Right to her own lawyer” currently has over 260,000 signatures, and in court on September 3, Britney seemed to endorse this new narrative. Though Jamie Spears has recently characterized Free Britney advocates as conspiracy theorists, Spears herself has indicated she would like to be liberated from her father’s control under the conservatorship, though chances of that happening, for the moment, appear slim. On November 11, a judge rejected an attempt to have Jamie Spears removed as conservator, despite Britney’s lawyers arguing that she is “afraid” of her father and that the two do not have a “viable working relationship.” And though the judge has said the door is still open for future challenges to the conservatorship, the ruling is just the latest in a long string of decisions in which Spears desire for greater transparency around her bizarre situation have been denied, ostensibly for her own protection.",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"In early September 2020 attorneys for Spears asked the court that records from her conservatorship be unsealed, other court filings on Spears’s behalf say that though the conservatorship is voluntary, Spears requests a change of conservator, substituting corporate fiduciary, Bessemer Trust Co., for her father. Permission to look seems to come, this time, from Britney herself:",0

1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"I think about Britney Spears like she is a childhood friend I grew apart from but still keep up with via social media, not even using her last name when I talk about her. On Instagram, I watch my personal Gothic heroine spin barefoot circles on a tile floor, model peasant crop tops, and stand up rod-straight for her best angle during a beach vacation. She is usually alone, looking up at the camera with the same giant, dark woodland creature eyes the world fell in love with when she was 17, begging the question: How was I supposed to know that something wasn’t right here? To me, these images mean something, but then again, when it comes to Britney, I am always looking for clues to confirm the fact that I am right about her. So does everyone else. To contradict Daniel Boorstin, she is a celebrity and a hero, perhaps born of the media but raised by the stories her fans tell ourselves about her.

1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"What is sexy, of course, is not just the socks themselves, but the girl’s bare legs. Bare legs of a girl are sexy by definition. Moreover, different parts of the legs have different degree of sexuality: the part below the knee is definitely less sexy than the part above the knee, and to the latter - the higher is a part of the thigh, the more sexy it is. From here, it is clear why leg-revealing clothes (short skirts, short dresses, short shorts) are generally seen sexy.",0

1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"a girl with bare legs (but without the socks) is already sexy. However, it does not necesserily imply that she is bare-legged due to her desire to look sexy! There can be other logical reasons for that: 1) she is on the beach; 2) she is taking bath; 3) she is in her bed; 4) it is just too hot outside, and she does not want to cover her legs not to get sweaty. So, it is still sexy, but is not always deliberately sexy.",0

So, it is definitely not the situation where extra clothes are unnecessary (as on the beach etc.), and it is definitely not the case when it is too hot (elsewise she would not put her socks on). All that means she has a reason to stay dressed and she has chosen to be dressed.",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"On the other hand, she left a part of her legs (above the socks and below her hemline) uncovered. And it just cannot be done accidentally! It can only be done by a conscious choice - she has chosen to leave her legs partially bare. But which part of her legs? If she wanted to leave the bottom part of her legs bare (i.e. by wearing breeches), it would not mean much; but she has preferred the opposite: to cover her bottom part of legs, and to leave the upper part of them (the sexiest part!) deliberately uncovered. She knows her bare thighs are visible by everyone around and she seems not to care about that!",0

1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"Fashion experts would consider a pair of socks on girls to be knee high when they’re about 40 to 50 centimeters long. Knee-high socks were spin-offs of white “high socks” of the 80s that covered the calves. In the 1980s many popular female personalities on TV and film would wear high socks that were often coordinated with miniskirt or a pair of denim shorts as part of their sexy get-up for a performance. High socks became a fashion craze in the 90s inspired by the movies Lolita and Clueless, and music television that featured Baby One More Time by Britney Spears who wore above the knee school socks.",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"However, knee-high socks are not exactly new clothing items. It should be noted that knee-high socks went way back in 18th century where women of nobility (one of whom was Marie Antoinette) would wear knee-high socks, hinting of eroticism underneath their conservative dresses. Sort of formal on the outside, but naughty on the inside. Fast forward to 1920s, knee-highs became the trend as women’s hemline got shorter. By the 1930s, both conservative and liberal-minded women wore colored knee-highs as part of their sports uniform and neutral colored knee socks for everyday wear. The 1960s rolled in, and so thus, the feminist movement and mod culture where short dresses, high heels, and knee-high socks were en vogue a la Twiggy.",0

This exposed skin points to the part of the woman/girl’s thigh that is between the hemline of the miniskirt (or sometimes pair of tight shorts) and the socks. This exposed skin is known in the Japanese anime culture as the “Absolute Territory” (Zettai ryōiki), which could make some guys drool.",0

1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"I’ll start with the social aspect of this, since it’s the simplest to describe; if you observe that others are either attracted to longer or shorter socks on a person, or use these cues to attempt to portray themselves as attractive, you will learn that either longer or shorter socks are sexier. The same would apply to many similar garments, and I think you will find that social norms do not control, but do influence the preference here.",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"Also, longer and shorter socks both do their part in accentuating and concealing different aspects of your anatomy. A “nude” sock, with a minimal or no cuff, highlights the ankles, brings the skin of the wearer into the spotlight, and covers only the foot in such a way that detail is somewhat compromised, whereas knee-high or thigh-high socks make an attempt to highlight the form of the wearer’s legs, while concealing the details of the skin beneath them. The cuff also plays a role in accentuating an area of the leg, and whether it cuts off near the knee, the thigh, the ankle, or is entirely removed from the garment’s design determines how this footwear feat is performed.",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"The term 'sexy' is different. It is not by showing off your inner body but covering it. When someone covers their body, not well dressed, guys have expectations and expectations makes them 'Sexy'.",0

2. Explain to her that you respect her tastes, but that you won’t allow her to wear what she wants to wear because you feel that her clothing can sometimes send the wrong message. Tell her that you ultimately want the best for her and although she may not agree, hopefully you can come to a compromise. Maybe you can pay for extra clothes or music for her if she agrees to modify what she wears.
3. Ask her kindly what she thinks her shirts imply-maybe ask her what that shirt “I have daddy issues” means to her and why she wants to wear it. Allow her to speak and if her explanation makes sense, let her wear the clothing. If she won’t provide a good explanation, then say that she’s not allowed to wear that shirt. That’s how the real world works outside and inside of high school—one has to be able to argue for what they believe in.

She needs to see why wearing such clothing as her default wardrobe is not a good idea-and you need to give her data that will get her to make the decision that she needs to make. I’d tell her the following:",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"* People will judge you by the way you look. This will be true throughout your life. The clothing that you are wearing sends a message about you. If you dress tastefully and appropriately for the ocassion, you’ll be treated with far more respect than you will if you dress scantily or shabbily. People who will be responsible for hiring you will judge your intelligence and competency by looking at how you choose to present yourself. Boys/men judge a woman by how she dresses when they are looking for a woman to date and/or marry. The boys/men that are true gentlemen and will treat you the way you should be treated will not want to be with a woman who dresses provocatively all the time or doesn’t know how to dress for the occasion. The boys/men who don’t respect women and see them only as sexual playthings will gravitate toward women who dress the way you are dressing with the see through clothing and the sexual messages. There is a reason prostitutes and porn stars dress the way they do-they want to be seen as sexual objects. There is a reason why women who are professionals dress in modest clothing-they want the focus to be on their competency and not their bodies. It’s a pretty decent bet that a man who is interested in you only when you dress provocatively is a man who is most likely to take advantage of you, see you only as a body he can have sex with and not a full person who should be a partner in life, or sexually assault you.
 * There is a time and a place for everything. One does not wear pajamas to church. One does not wear a suit to a nightclub. A person doesn’t wear a bikini to school or work. Dressing provocatively with sexual messages to school and on dates is not appropriate for the ocassion.
 * You understand that as a girl, she wants to be attractive. But there are ways to be attractive and exude sexuality without dressing provocatively. Clothing that shows off her assets while providing coverage is attractive and sexy to most boys/men who are worth having. Being attractive does not equate to being dressed like a hooker.
If you take the time to guide her and teach her, she will be far more receptive than if you simply pound the desk and threaten to take her clothes from her. She’s fifteen. She isn’t thinking like a grown woman would think. Don’t assume she is doing it for all the wrong reasons, its likely she simply doesn’t understand the full ramifications of her dressing the way she is.",0

In the rain and the wind, he always stood straight
The feathers flew in village, terrible uproar hoisted
In our house, always, there was some good eggs. (the original word here is “jaja”, which means both eggs and balls)",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"I've had a dreadful rooster, he was a real lunatic

Cause of the rooster even I had the reputation.",0

1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"I've had a dreadful rooster, he was a champion.
Cocks are weird today, every hair is buggering them
I wouldn't know the reason, today are the different days
Anyways, to the rooster of mine, they are all fishes!",0

When you have young rooster, do not let him suffer
Let him fly, let the hens see him.
Later it will be to late, and rooster has it's own time",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"In case you haven’t figured it out, rooster is a metaphore for a penis. Fun fact, this song is written by one of the most famous yugoslavian singers/songrwriters.",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"I rather like the ambiguous ending to the song Lola by The Kinks, about a very deep-voiced woman who may be a transsexual or a cross-dressing man. It ends:",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"Well I'm not the world's most masculine man
 But I know what I am and I'm glad I'm a man
 And so's Lola",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"Depending on how you read it, this could mean either ""Lola and I are both glad that I am a man"", ""I am glad that Lola and I are both men"" or ""I am glad that I am a man and Lola is also glad that s/he is a man"".",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"But the cleverest dirty lyrics of all occurred in a strip of the cartoon King Cat, which used to appear in The Daily Star. The cat is bouncing along singing ""Fa-la-lah, tra-la-la-lee"", and then he stops, turns to the audience, grins evilly and says ""Why do all English folk songs have choruses which go 'Fa-la-lah, tra-la-la-lee'? Because the words are so filthy that nobody dares sing them."" And you know it's true.",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,Lindsey Buckingham wrote the following lyric (apparently) about being stood up for a date. He may well have written this about Stevie Nicks walking out on him.,0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"%3E Think of me, sweet darlin’,
 When everything is going bad.
 Think of me, sweet darlin’,
 Every time you're feeling sad.
 Think of me, sweet darlin’,
 Every time you don't come.

1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,There's nothing wrong in it though BUT going back to 2017 when a friend of mine started using social media! She uploaded her picture there which was a selfie. Now you know well that a selfie can't predict anybody's age.,0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"So, one user saw her profile, thought her to be about 18 years of age and befriended her. Like many online friends, they started talking. They were talking daily and became kind of addicted to each other.",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"So, one day , she and that guy got to know just through chatting that they live in the same place, (same district, ahem!)! Early teen girls (mostly 11 to 13) need somebody to talk to, that's it, Don't go too far! They reveal everything about themselves online but their ideology is - Talk till you're happy, leave once they're serious. (No offence to anyone, most of the early teen girls do this and I've seen that).",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"She revealed school name, address, tuition centre (lol) and soon she found out herself in his clutches! They met and there was no way to escape except saying “yes” to whatever he said! He found out that she was a school going girl still he wanted to do timepass!",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"Once I was sitting with her. I asked - “why you're so tired?” And she said sadly, “I had to talk whole night.” I asked , “It's your wish right?” She :- “You won't understand! I have to! There's no other way!”",0

1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,There's nothing wrong with this girl here but I just gave an example of what's wrong if somebody misunderstands your age!,0

1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"But it's not wrong accroding to my opinion. I remember when I was a teen, we didn't have sources, social connections, knowledge and internet. But now teens have all the sources and knowledge as well as understanding.",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"Why we are so much focusing on “age” that they are teen. If someone is 20+, then we rarely judge anyone if they are 22 or 32 then why we are judging them just because they are teenagers. Why they can't do what elders do?",0

1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"* School.
 * Smartphone.
The pressure of study and tension is much more as compared to our generation. Also, smartphone and internet is part of everyday life. Teenagers now have access to world, people, sources and they are connected to people of every age. They can read, understand and are seeing all aspects of life.",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"So, if they are available on social media and people comment them, follow them and appreciate then why they shouldn't behave matured? They should and it's what people expect from them.",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"Many teenagers are choosing it as career like being influencer, YouTuber etc. All their interest and activity gave them enough of maturity how to bahave on social media and what people expect to see. Thus, I don't think there's anything wrong if teenagers act or look older than they are. The time has gone when 'age' was a criteria, now age doesn't matter.",0

1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"She was born in 2003, and now she is only 17 years old, but dresses as if she were much older. Don't you find it inappropriate that some of these young people wear such clothes?",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"She puts herself at risk, who knows what is hiding in the dark. People may argue that it is her choice to choose what she wants to wear freely. I don't think any of us would want a teenager to get into any kind of trouble. And it's only because they overestimated their level of maturity.",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"And this is Selena Gomez, when she was 15 years old.",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"She has a pretty good appearance. I think there is always this comparison between children of the same generation, and we will inevitably choose the one with which we will be more comfortable, for example, Selena Gomez in a modest and beautiful suit.",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"People hate it when some teenagers behave older than they are. Because teenagers underestimate everything that comes in their way. It is annoying as sometimes teenagers behave like the smartest and mature people. But they end up asking for help when it becomes necessary. Not everyone is sure that teenagers make more important decisions, so there is a reason why there is an age limit when it comes to voting, for example.",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"I am not here to say that I am against how Bhad Bhabie dresses so candidly. She can show as much as she wants within the legal limits of course. I mean, if I were in that position, I would be too worried about my own safety to dress so candidly.",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,Nothing. Absolutely nothing.,0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"While there are some teenagers who try to look older than their age, there are a few who have no say in how their body is shaping, like me.",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"My trusted online friends don’t believe I am thirteen because of the photos I sent them or because of the way my mind works. For reference, I’m kinda tall and something you would call “healthy”. I wouldn’t like to attach a photo.",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"If not naturally, teenagers do go for surgeries and applying make-up on their face to look older, probably to woo someone or maybe because they’re “disgusted” to be that age.",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"I reckon it’s fine to a limit, but when teens go all out to look 25 when they’re 15, that’s where the problem steps in.",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"Although, the second category, or the people who have no say in their phase of puberty, they suffer the most because everyone taunts them saying “You look older than you are. Did you do something?”, and there you sit wondering, “Why must you hurt me in this way, puberty?”",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"So, to cut it short, no. There is nothing wrong with looking or acting older on purpose, to an extent. Boundaries exist to everything, and so here. But when it’s natural, we can’t help it.",0

1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"If we're talking about girls who dress in revealing, ""adult"" clothes with heavy makeup etc… there is nothing wrong with that. Sure, it can lead to unwanted attention, so it's not necessarily desirable. But in that case, which person is really in the wrong, the person in the sexy clothes, or the person who harasses her? **",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"Young people who dress more suggestively don't do it to seem mature (in the good judgement, taxes and W-2s way). In my experience, they do so to experiment with their expression while in their sexual prime. Yeah, it's uncomfortable to think about, but once puberty hits, that's nature's cue to start getting it on. A child with an adult’s body might understandably want to dress like an adult.",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"Also, sex appeal isn't the only way to look older. People often tell youngsters that they are too young to be worrying about money and a career and society. (Yet we love forcing college prep onto them.)",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"So sometimes, teens want to look older just to be taken seriously. Would an audience of adults be more willing to listen to a teen in Hollister sweats, holding an iPhone 7, or a young woman in a pantsuit with a Macbook? At events like DECA and FBLA, kids are expected to wear formal business attire.",0
1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"Why do teenagers need to “dress their age?” What does it really mean to ""dress your age?"" At 13, 15, even 18 or 19, teens have such a wide variety of experiences and perspectives, it's not fair to limit how they present themselves to arbitrary expectations.",0

1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"Sometimes people dress to fit in with the people that they are around, or to emulate people they admire. Sometimes they want attention, sometimes they’re just comfortable with their bodies and aren’t thinking about who’s looking at them in what way.

1445265856603230213,Britney Spears is a teasing slut,"I’m NOT saying that people should be expected not to look at or feel attraction to someone who dresses suggestively. But I do think it is perfectly reasonable to expect people not to act out their impulses without consent. Age makes no difference here, nor does gender. The person could be 15 or 50, a short skirt, a low-cut top, open shirt etc…. does not give anyone the right to approach them sexually.",0

First, President Barack Obama committed a regrettable indiscretion on the Jay Leno Show by comparing his own bowling ineptitude with the level of skill on display — so the joke goes — at the Special Olympics. But honest people may feel a little uncomfortable with excessive sanctimony about this incident. In fact, at some point most of us have probably been guilty of making or being amused by similar digs at our fellow citizens with mental retardation. For example, a few years ago in Doonesbury, cartoonist Gary Trudeau, referring to the nontraditionally high levels of medals and ribbons awarded during modern military campaigns like Panama and Grenada, referred to them as a sort of Special Olympics for the armed forces. Everyone gets a medal. To many people a Special Olympics joke seems harmless enough; mere innocuous fun at the expense of a subset of fellow citizens who for one reason or another simply aren’t able to learn as well as the rest of us do. But here’s another news story so wretched that I’m embarrassed to admit that it occurred in my own community: Several employees of the Corpus Christi State School, a state-run facility that houses nearly 400 citizens with mental retardation, are accused of goading residents into fight club-style bouts and recording them on their cell phones. One inspired attendant allegedly supplied an accompanying play-by-play voiceover. Apparently the goal of these misguided “caretakers” was their own amusement. This is the dark underside of all Special Olympics jokes. When I was in college I worked in a similar state-run facility, a dormitory housing 40 men with profound retardation. They ranged in age from 18 to over 60, but the highest mental age was about 18 months. Many had other disabilities, as well. A few were blind or deaf. Only one had sufficient mental capacity to utter a few disconnected words. They were infants in the bodies of men, and they needed the same around-the-clock care. We got them up in the mornings and put them to bed at night. We fed them and gave them their medicines. During the day we tried as much as possible to keep them dressed, and every evening we pushed their clothes into a massive urine- and feces-soaked mound and gave them all a shower. These aren’t men and boys who will ever be able to participate in the Special Olympics or have any other ordinary contact with the world. To a large extent they had been abandoned by their families; visitors were rare. Most of the caretakers tried to do more or less responsible jobs, but we were poorly trained and poorly paid, and most of us soon moved on to other jobs. The residents stayed behind, for a lifetime. I’ve never accepted the romantic view that people with disabilities like these were created for some special purpose, to instruct us, for example, in humility or awe. If they were designed for such a purpose, divine providence is asking a lot of them. In some respects their stories are incidental tragedies that include damaged chromosomes, accidents, or parents who drank too much. Nevertheless, there’s something to be learned. To walk for the first time into the dayroom of a dorm like the one where I worked is to be almost overwhelmed with sympathy for fellow humans trapped in their dismal conditions. But the feeling lasted only a few days. Even in the near-absence of ordinary intellect, personalities quickly emerged and a unique humanity was evident in each of the residents. And at the risk of idealizing a dreary situation, I’ve never encountered a sweeter, gentler group of men with less of the malicious nastiness that we often find among our peers. No Special Olympics jokes here, and no one would ever goad anyone else into fighting for his own amusement. That takes “normal” intelligence. Jcrisp@delmar.edu",0

A lot of people still dont recognize him because he works on TBS, but he's still the funniest nonetheless. He is very creative with what he does and is the funny kind of sarcastic, which a lot of people can't do. I highly suggest you watch his interactions with his coworkers, Jordan Schlansky, they are hilarious. Unlike some of the people on this list, he carries the jokes on his show with or without his guest.
2. Seth Meyers. He is the second most hilarious in my opinion. He worked on SNL before so he has a history and comedy and skits. He wasn't very good in the beginning of his career, but soon he learned to adapt to his surroundings and became even better at his jokes, I think.
3. James Corden. Corden is carried by his guests many times in terms of humor, and I don't know if he can survive the late night comedy genre without them, but he’s funny with them and he is extremely creative with his games and skits, excluding Carpool Karaoke (which I dont like). He is sarcastic and can make fun of himself though, so that's a win for him
4. Jimmy Kimmel. (Same as James Corden)
5. Stephen Colbert. I dont think comedy is his strong game, but in his case, I dont think it matters. He is the #1 late time show, so whatever he is doing it is working.
6. Jimmy Fallon. Awkward. Very awkward. Not funny and sometime his skits are outright awful. I still have nightmares from the skit where he and a celebrity pretend to be cops and spits food on each other. He often speaks over and interrupts the guests. However, in the end, he has the most A-listers on this list for some reason. What disappoints a lot of people about Jimmy Fallon is that he is hosting the same show that Johnny Carson did once, and he is ruining it.
7. (New) Lilly Singh. She's new on NBC as a late time talk show host, and she sounds like it. She is an Indian, bisexual, female, and while that is amazing for diversity, she just isn't funny. At all. Her jokes revolve around the fact that all of her late TV contemporaries are all white, straight, males and how she isn't. It's hard to explain but she isn't funny at all and she should stick to her YouTube videos, where she became popular.
Remember, these are all my opinions on who is the funniest, and I may not have the same humor as you!",0

And I don’t know if its a peculiar brand of Hispanic humor but he would set up a joke, and then instead of having a punch line like in conventional comedy, he would put his finger across his upper lip, fake laugh and walk sideways.

Solange, her sister, a singer/musician and star in her own right, wrote songs for Destiny’s Child and Beyoncé or years before becoming a solo artist. I recall being awed when Beyoncé debuted her all-women band, The Suga Mamas, in her music video for “Irreplaceable” in 2007, and subsequently made them her touring band for The Beyoncé Experience world tour and several tours to follow. Bottom line, Beyoncé loves and exalts women, especially Black women; just not fat Black women.",0

I’ve been rocking with Queen B since LeToya and LaTavia were a part of the original Destiny’s Child. From “Dangerously in Love” to “Lemonade,” and yes, even Carmen: A Hip Hopera to last year’s live-action The Lion King, I’ve supported Bey’s vast career: the good, the amazing, the fierce, and dare I say, even the mediocre. A common thread through it all has been her undeniable hard work and dedication to her grind, and pushing against the glass ceilings people try to box female entertainers in, all while bringing other Black and brown girls and women along with her. In more recent years, she’s utilized her colossal influence to represent and amplify Black diasporic culture. But again, I ask, where the big girls at?",0
1445215300543262720,@thenasmaraj beyonce is fat.,"It’s no secret that plus size people, especially women, are seen as the least physically desirable in current society, in spite of the average American woman being a size 16. Additionally, Black women were unfairly and devastatingly named as the least desired in an OKCupid study that followed dating app trends. This study proceeded the infamous since-removed article that Psychology Today blogger Satoshi Kanazawa published on the magazine’s website proclaiming that Black women are the least attractive women of all races. Based on this collection of receipts, and my lived experience, the combination of being a Black and larger bodied woman in an overtly anti-Black, fatphobic society leaves very few spaces for fat, Black women to be truly seen and celebrated.",0
1445215300543262720,@thenasmaraj beyonce is fat.,"Let’s go back to 2016 momentarily, when I was a graduate student in very white Santa Cruz, California at UC Santa Cruz. It was a few short months before graduation, and I was completely burned out. The workload, racism and discrimination I’d been subjected to the second time around at an institution of higher learning—where I was the only Black person in my program and most of my loved ones were 2,500 miles away—had worn me down, and tried to break my spirit. I will never forget when Lemonade premiered on HBO, my best friend, Aleesa, calling me super excited and telling me I had to watch it ASAP. She was at a loss for words, but kept repeating how beautiful and powerful it was, and that I just had to watch for myself.",0

We were mesmerized by how aesthetically gorgeous the visuals were. How glorious, and majestic, and Black Lemonade was. How the themes of Intuition, Denial, Anger, Apathy, Emptiness, Accountability, Reformation, Forgiveness, Resurrection, Hope and Redemption wove together the journey of the pain and impact of infidelity, to the revival of commitment, and ultimate healing and celebration of Black love; a love that has survived centuries of attempted murder.",0

As moved as I was by the array of Black women’s beauty and intricacies visually represented in the project—the range in complexion, hair type and style, height, shape, and overall features—I could not help but notice that everyone was invited to the table except fat Black women. Almost every type of Black feminine aesthetic was celebrated except the plush bodies that have been relegated as non-sexual and exclusively matronly. And that hurt, deeply, because as brother Malcolm wisely identified and Beyoncé reiterated, the Black woman is the most disrespected, unprotected, and neglected person in America, though I’d venture to say the world. Fat Black women triply so, at the intersection of race, gender, AND size bias.",0

Also, like everyone else, she has been force-fed fatphobia and Eurocentric beauty ideals through media, diet culture and especially as an entertainer, who is required to be as close to society’s definition of perfection as possible to reach the heights of success she has—especially being a Black woman, working twice as hard to get half as much.",0

I’m watching this trio do their thing, and although the other two women singing were very talented it was IMPOSSIBLE not to be staring at Beyoncé. Was she ravishingly beautiful? Well, ok. But trust me, just being physically gorgeous can get boring pretty quickly.

Her other hits are nowhere near that awful but even then I can’t quite get into them because when a guy treats her badly in one of her songs and she rightfully shows her power to him, it feels very much like a fantasy, not something that would actually happen. My favourite songwriters are ones that show vulnerability. You can see a lot of realism in the words Joni Mitchell wrote or the words Leonard Cohen wrote, or for a more modern example, the words that Regina Spektor wrote. Not every songwriter needs the most accurate understanding of relationships ever but I find Beyonce to be more about girl power (which isn’t necessarily a bad thing, young women may get a lot of confidence from that which is important for their development) than the actual truth of what happens when a couple seperate.",0
1445215300543262720,@thenasmaraj beyonce is fat.,"Now that this is out of the way I have to blatantly disagree with that statement that her voice is very average. It’s incredible. Beyonce can hit four octaves and while four is a small number in general, anyone who knows music theory knows that this is a huge range. Bruce Dickinson of metal band Iron Maiden and many opera singers can be credited with this, but how many people in the pop world can say they have four octaves or more? Well there’s Mariah Carey at five octaves. She’s unbelievable. Yet i’m not sure I can think of anyone else. Now this is of course on a purely technical level and I don’t think that’s what makes a great singer, I mean i’m in the minority that Tom Waits has one of the most unbelievable voices i’ve ever heard because I have a different definition to the masses of what constitutes as a great singer. That being that a singer doesn’t need to sound polished and easy to bare on first listening nor does a singer have to have a particularly high range. A singer just needs to be in control of the notes they’re singing and have a lot of passion in the way they deliver them. And Beyonce is passionate.",0

Whether it’s NATO allies supposedly failing to pay their bills, evil German carmakers, or a friendly neighbor with whom we actually have a trade surplus, Trump has painted America (and himself) as the victim of unfair trade practices, inequitable deals, and general assholery. What he’s spoken less about is his own habit of ripping people off, which, to hear his alleged victims tell it, is Trump’s thing the way other people collect stamps or play squash on weekends. In addition to charges that the president used charitable donations to pay off golf debts and acquire portraits of himself, hundreds of liens, lawsuits, and judgements have accused the former real-estate developer of failing to pay people for their work, including dishwashers, plumbers, waiters, bartenders, real-estate brokers, and law firms. (He also reportedly took his time paying Michael Cohen back the $130,000 his personal lawyer spent to silence porn star Stormy Daniels.) Since 2005, Trump’s companies have been cited 24 times for violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act for failing to pay overtime or minimum wage. During a presidential debate in 2016, he basically admitted to failing to fairly compensating workers, saying “I take advantage of the laws of the nation because I’m running a company. My obligation right now is to do well for myself, my family, my employees, for my companies. And that’s what I do.” In other words, I find loopholes to screw people over because I was born a colossal prick and I’ll die a colossal prick. So it probably shouldn’t come as much of a surprise to learn that Trump allegedly cheated his personal driver out of hundreds of thousands in overtime.

Cintron, who is a registered Republican, said in the complaint that he worked an average of 50 to 55 hours a week for Big Orange, but was never paid overtime for hours worked above 40 per week, as is legally required. According to the filing, Cintron was paid $62,700 in 2003; $68,000 in 2006; and $75,000 in 2010. Though if you thought Trump just got extra generous in 2010, you thought wrong!",0

You run into assholes all day, you’re the asshole.” Yet in a 2020 America on the precipice of a monumental presidential election, it seems that assholes are not only everywhere you turn—in newspapers, on cable TV, at political rallies and protests, and all over social media—but that they, and their behavior, has been normalized. It’s this “rising tide of assholery” that’s the focus of director John Walker’s Assholes: A Theory, which adapts philosophy professor Aaron James’ 2012 non-fiction book into a documentary aimed at both precisely defining the term “asshole,” and investigating how those who fit that bill have increasingly come to dominate key spheres of modern public life.",0

Without once bringing him up, Walker makes clear that Trump is the embodiment of this problem, given that his election to the highest office—and subsequent flouting of rules and standards of common decency—has made it appear acceptable, and in fact rewarding, to act in the worst possible manner as a means of achieving one’s selfish ends. He is, the film silently contends, the apex of American assholery.",0

As James states, “The asshole, as I define it, is the guy who allows himself special advantages in cooperative life out of an entrenched sense of entitlement that immunizes him against the complaints of other people.” In other words, he’s the individual—generally male, although as John Cleese candidly admits, his mother probably was one too—who thinks the general rules don’t apply to them because they’re somehow smarter, better, or more special than their fellow citizens. James’ example is a surfer who violates the right-of-way customs in the ocean. Yet the type is universal, whether in line at the grocery store, on the road in traffic, or at work.

That process begins with Sherry Lee Benson-Podolchuk, a former Royal Canadian Mounted Police officer who left her job after suffering harassment and discrimination from boorish male colleagues. When she subsequently wrote a book about her mistreatment (Women Not Wanted), she was further vilified by a police force that prized protecting its own—and upholding its ugly, sexist atmosphere—over doing the right thing. In the midst of ongoing protests and debate over America’s own domestic police culture, which has long had a tradition of closing ranks and demonizing critics, Benson-Podolchuk’s ordeal sounds eerily familiar.",0

And the military champions initiation-ritual abuse in service of its own greater good. Using relevant clips from, respectively, Animal House, The Wolf of Wall Street and Full Metal Jacket, director Walker forwards the notion that these milieus are all rife with a similar brand of assholery in which arrogance and entitlement justify all manner of despicable ideas and deeds.",0

That type of me-first worldview is crucial to Walker and James’ conception of their subject, and though some of the film’s tangents could use more fleshing out—like the notion that most NHL players are inherently assholes—its overarching classification of assholery feels spot-on. Moreover, while its form can be a bit staid and clunky (its animated interludes are unnecessary), it has a cheeky sense of humor, as when it compares asshole-rich America (where “exceptionalism” is ingrained from an early age) to asshole-light Canada (where folks tend to be more agreeable and accommodating).",0

This article touches on some of that. But its central aim is to create a psychological portrait of the man. Who is he, really? How does his mind work? How might he go about making decisions in office, were he to become president? And what does all that suggest about the sort of president he’d be?",0
1445209511560626178,"@GeorgeTakei Melania, like Donald Trump, is a selfish asshole.","In creating this portrait, I will draw from well-validated concepts in the fields of personality, developmental, and social psychology. Ever since Sigmund Freud analyzed the life and art of Leonardo da Vinci, in 1910, scholars have applied psychological lenses to the lives of famous people. Many early efforts relied upon untested, nonscientific ideas. In recent years, however, psychologists have increasingly used the tools and concepts of psychological science to shed light on notable lives, as I did in a 2011 book on George W. Bush. A large and rapidly growing body of research shows that people’s temperament, their characteristic motivations and goals, and their internal conceptions of themselves are powerful predictors of what they will feel, think, and do in the future, and powerful aids in explaining why. In the realm of politics, psychologists have recently demonstrated how fundamental features of human personality—such as extroversion and narcissism—shaped the distinctive leadership styles of past U. S. presidents, and the decisions they made. While a range of factors, such as world events and political realities, determine what political leaders can and will do in office, foundational tendencies in human personality, which differ dramatically from one leader to the next, are among them.",0

In this essay, I will seek to uncover the key dispositions, cognitive styles, motivations, and self-conceptions that together comprise his unique psychological makeup. Trump declined to be interviewed for this story, but his life history has been well documented in his own books and speeches, in biographical sources, and in the press.

2. He’s working around people who know that he’s a fraud, and who have no respect for him; nor do they fear him.
3. He’s involved in several crises for which he has no solutions. Worst of all, no one will take his word for things like they have done many times in the past.
4. He’s facing levels of criticism which far exceed anything that the New York City press ever leveled against him. Since he’s woefully unprepared for that level of critique, his response is to become even more rude and abrupt than he is “normally”.
5. He knows or strongly suspects that if he loses the November 2020 election his business empire is going to collapse, that he and several of his children are likely facing sealed indictments against them in the State of New York, and that the enemies he’s made in Washington DC are going to be be pursuing him and seeking his downfall for the remaining years he has left.
One of the above would make an average person irritable and uncertain.

Why aren't they in federal prison NOW?!?!,"The description of Trump as a terrorist leader is neither metaphor nor hyperbole—it is the assessment of veteran national security experts. Trump, those experts say, adopted a method known as stochastic terrorism, a process of incitement where the instigator provokes extremist violence under the guise of plausible deniability. Although the exact location, timing, and source of the violence may not be predictable, its occurrence is all but inevitable. When pressed about the incitement, the instigator typically responds with equivocal denials and muted denunciations of violence, or claims to have been “joking,” as Trump and those speaking on his behalf routinely made.",0

After Biden’s victory, extremists responding to Trump’s lies about fraud stalked and menaced public officials, election workers, and Trump’s Democratic and Republican critics. “Stop the Steal” rallies led to beatings, stabbings, and a shooting.

In an op-ed three weeks before the election, Neumann wrote that Trump had “repeatedly been confronted” with evidence of his rhetoric causing violence, and that his “inconsistent and muddied” denouncements of violence and white supremacists only exacerbated the problem: “Extremists thrive on this mixed messaging, interpreting it as coded support.”",0

Gretchen Whitmer. He then sided with the armed protesters who swarmed the state Capitol: “These are very good people, but they are angry,” he tweeted. “They want their lives back again, safely!” By early October, the FBI had arrested 13 people for violent plots, including some who allegedly planned to kidnap Whitmer. Far-right extremists also allegedly targeted Gov. Ralph Northam of Virginia, whom Trump had blasted as “crazy” for his pandemic policies and for supposedly planning to take away Virginians’ guns.

The scale of the resources needed today, he says, may well be tenfold greater than during the Obama administration. Using law enforcement to track and disrupt extremists is essential, but it shouldn’t be the only response. “It can’t just be analysts who are observing and detecting chatter online,” Selim says. “There has to be comprehensive involvement of mental health, social services, and education providers. All of government needs to be brought to bear, along with local community partners. We all saw in the past four years how the violent melees and divisive discourse played out at town halls and in communities across the country.

In fact, she said, ""Madonna is a movie killer. She's dead behind the eyes. She cannot act her way out of a paper bag. She should not be in film or on stage. She's a wonderful performer for what she does, but she's not an actress. Bing!"" An ""outraged"" Madonna spoke a Women's Rally in Washington, D.C., and confessed she'd ""thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House,"" since Trump took office. ""But,"" she said, ""I know this won't change anything."" In response, Trump called the singer ""disgusting."" ""She hurt that whole cause,"" he said. ""I thought what she said was disgraceful to our country."" After comparisons between Gaga's ""Born This Way"" and Madonna's ""Express Yourself"" were made, a shady rivalry was born. ""I don't mean to disrespect Madonna...She's a nice lady. And she's had a fantastic, huge career. She's the biggest pop star of all time. But I play a lot of instruments. I write all my own music. I spend hours and hours a day in the studio. I'm a producer. I'm a writer. What I do is different,"" Gaga told Zane Lowe in a perceived dig at the ""Music"" singer.

According to Sara, ""She was not impressed! She was like, 'What are these kids doing here?'"" Sadly, Erin admitted, ""She wanted nothing to do with us.""

MJ couldn’t play the guitar like Prince, but Eddie Van Halen could, so MJ worked with him. Whereas Prince insisted from the beginning that he should produce all his own material MJ knew he needed Quincy Jones and others. To me one of the major difference is that Prince was more driven as an artist than MJ, who was of course pushed into show business by his father.

Over the years it has ranged from being too sexually provocative to being untalented. Now it tends to be in the derogatory ageist or ‘desperate’ vein.

There are a number of exceptions to this but most pop performers up through the 60s were well trained musicians – Frank Sinatra supposedly studied and copied two people – Tommy Dorsey and the violinist Jascha Heifetz for instance. The Beatles were disciples of all kinds of music from classical to Indian and were serious about learning and performing it at a high level.,0
1445165401856516097,No matter how rich you are Madonna is trash.,"Another thing that has changed, is that through the mid 70s the recording industry was wide open to very creative talent. There is no way a guy like Frank Zappa could ever get a recording contract now. Or Yes or Genesis or probably not even the Kinks. Those open minded days of rewarding and developing creativity, for all intent and purposes, ended in 1976 with the advent of disco. And then a few years later in the early 80s, MTV and music videos drove the final stake home. From that point on pretty much all that is allowed to get produced at a high level (excepting performers that were already established like Bowie and Gabriel etc) is dance music - and the performer must look great on camera. (Think Madonna) End of story.",0

You couldn't control the radio or tv or watch a decent movie at home.

1445165401856516097,No matter how rich you are Madonna is trash.,"Not a lot of money was really lost from napster. Most of the music traded was music people weren't going to buy any way. The quality of the mp3s were low and if you wanted something good you could buy it on cd. In fact, there are many many cases of people discovering new music to buy this way. What the music industry was really afraid of was the sharing platforms ability to freely distribute unsigned artists material that they could now increasingly produce at home without the need for the traditional music channels. This scared them to death. So, they sued children and grandma's for huge sums of money in order to scare people off the sharing programs like limewire and napster. Because they could not control artists that could create and distribute their own music. How could they scam money out of them? So, the sharing platforms had to go. Even artists like metallica (especially) were afraid of other talented musicians making music as well as they could without the industry contacts and nepatisim stealing their fans.",0

1445165401856516097,No matter how rich you are Madonna is trash.,"1. Analysis of music over the decades has shown current popular music pushes the volume way up, is more maximalist, etc.
2. There is far less diversity (in the US at least). It’s basically a few music trends and what I described in #1 with extremely engineered commercial music intended to get stuck in people’s heads no matter how awful and unoriginal they are.
3. Other countries are not stepping up to the plate like they had in the past, particularly the UK. A lot of popular music from the 60s, 70s, 80s, and 90s was from the UK and some from mainland Europe. What happened? Occasionally a Swedish artist will have a hit and some pop-EDM DJ from the Netherlands, that’s about it. Part of that is the US being in its own bubble more than ever.
4. Since the 50s, pop music coexisted with rock, but that stopped sometime in the late 00s. Since then, it’s been 90% pop/r&b/hiphop/edm and 10% rock, with the latter being the same commercial radio bands following #1 and occasionally some breakthrough indie artists that have a song that goes viral.
5. I think a large part of this is due to internal political and social divisions in the US and genres of music being aligned with skin colors and politics, which is really sad. Ie, if you want to seem progressive, cool, and not be accused of being racist and right wing politically, you have to pretend you love current R&B, hiphop, trap, and all pop music inspired by those genres (you’re not cool if you say you like pop-rock like Maroon5 and Imagine Dragons) even if you really don’t.
6. The cost of living is so high in major western cities now, so aspiring artists have to either be well off already, with parents helping pay for living costs, or find ways to keep costs down (ie, making most of the music on computer software).
7. Too many distractions in the form of consumable entertainment so people are spending less time crafting musical talent while as the same time, as mentioned above, computer software can substitute where actual talent is lacking and do so in far less time. The downside is, it still sounds digital, too clean, too similar to others.",0

It’s crazy that Madonna can easily be compared to and (maybe even winning the argument) that she could compete with the top stars of 1995, 2000, 2005, 1984, etc. I think that Beyonce’s legacy is equal to that of Madonna’s for her time (remember general!).",0

But it also depends on what a persons definition or view of what makes a person popular etc. Just cuz some ppl still listen to her music and might mention her in a post on here or a comment on social media doesn't make her as popular as was in 80s.

She is not the best singer, the best dancer, the best actress or the best looking girl. She is also said to be very rude. In fact, music producers and record company’s executives questioned her existence in music industry for a long time and thought she would be soon forgotten . Her rival at the time was if you remember Cindy Lauper who is by far more talented.Only to be proven wrong.Madonna is the ultimate byproduct of shock value and self promotion. She is no doubt very clever. Everyone knows that in the beginning of her career she slept her way to the top.But, apart from being promiscuous, which is not so rare after all, she is also very disciplined, hard working and resilient. The moment she started being successful she quit drugs. When everybody hated her for being too provocative she used all the bad publicity for her own benefit. She didn’t crack no matter her turbulent personal life, professional mistakes or failures, she moved on.Not only did she put everything behind and moved on, she was literally resurrected from her own ashes. She managed to stay relevant by changing completely her style every time she released an album she was a completely different woman in every single way, her outfits, her hair style, her music, her songs.She evolved, didn’t remain static. While others indulge to drugs and alcohol, like Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey, she found an outlet to sports and yoga.I think her self confidence is that makes her so special though, she may lack everything else. She is very self confident and works very hard. I think of her more of as a business woman rather than an artist. As she herself said when asked about her height ‘’everything about me is average’’.She must have had a bad reaction to some medicine as she actually told the truth. Madonna is mediocre at everything she does, to say the least, but she has built her career on manic ambition, courage and physical strength.

This single is so breezy and catchy and people call it the song of the Summer. Recent singles (like Ghosttown) would’ve been huge hits if radio would still play her. But they don’t. That happens to every artist. When was the last time Paul McCartney was on the Hot 100 as a solo artist? He still makes great music though, too.

1445162851908341762,"Mbappé: “I hate France. I hate Paris. I hate Neymar. It is time I moved to England, to play for Arsenal.”","While the trickeries look pleasing to the eye, it is not necessary that is effective in a game too. In spite of him, achieving so much in his short career, he has failed to deliver what was expected out of him. He was thought of as a natural replacement for Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. And here are some reasons behind this:
• None Unnecessary touches, tricks and flicks: He became a household name once the videos of him showcasing his skills and tricks started taking the rounds online. He was playing for Santos at that moment. But there comes a point in everyone's life when he should act mature and do only what's necessary. He must understand that he is bought not to be a showboat, but a clinical goalscorer. He is often seen toying with defenders rather than playing a simple pass or a through ball to a teammate who is in a much better position. He is targeted because of pure frustration and not because of any fear.
• None Doing all on his own: Football is a team game and everyone has to do their bit in order to ensure that they give their 100 per cent in the game. Although individual brilliance can turn the game on its head, it is the team that actually matters. He is surrounded by the likes of Angel Di Maria, Julian Draxler, Marco Verratti and Kylian Mbappe at PSG. Also, Philippe Coutinho, Willian, Gabriel Jesus and Douglas Costa are present in the national team. But, he always tries to do everything on his own. Words like “Selfish” and “Arrogant” have been associated with him. Although he will display some great content for YouTube videos, it is the by-product that actually matters.
• None Attitude and ego-issues: It's very difficult to reach the top but it is even tougher to maintain it. He was a part of the Barcelona family from 2013-17 before forcing his way out of the club. It is a badly-kept secret that he joined PSG in order to get away from Messi's shadow and eventually win the Ballon d'Or. In a game when PSG was comfortably ahead in the game and Neymar had already scored a hat-trick, they were awarded a penalty. In spite of the fact that the goal could have helped Edinson Cavani become the record goalscorer for PSG, Neymar didn't let him take the spot-kick.",0

1445162851908341762,"Mbappé: “I hate France. I hate Paris. I hate Neymar. It is time I moved to England, to play for Arsenal.”","1. Neymar plays for Brazil and they share a long standing rivalry with Argentina which is a football crazy nation like Brazil and has one of the most passionate fan-base. It’s only natural that all that patriotism turns into hatred towards their biggest rivals, specially towards the biggest name of the team.
2. Secondly by the Barcelona football club fans due to the way he engineered his big money move to PSG. FC Barcelona is one of the most successful football clubs of the generation and boats a huge fan base. Most of the fans still hate him for leaving the club during the twilight of Messi’s career, especially when Neymar was considered the heir-apparent to the soon to be vacant throne. I rarely noticed fans complaining much and nit-picking his play-style when Neymar was playing for them. I can only imagine what happens if he does a Figo/Ronaldo and signs for Real Madrid.
3. Then there is a set of followers who hate him for his diving and off-the pitch antics. Sure, he dives but if you consider the Ronaldos, Robbens and Youngs of the world, he doesn’t even compare . I don’t see Ronaldo getting as much hate, except from the rival football team fans nor does Robben. Nevertheless, he gets a portion of that hate from those moral-policing football fans. And then, Neymar like a Pogba, is a modern football super-star who isn’t afraid to show boat. In the world of ever-present social media, some portion of the hate comes from people who are caught in the transition and think that all the things they see isn’t what a football player should be. They don’t necessarily hate him but they don’t like him - which roughly translates to hatred.
4. This brings us to the final group, The Messi-Ronaldo fan base - In the current football world, you can either be a Messi supporter or a Ronaldo supporter or someone living under a rock. I am not saying you can’t like both or can’t have any other favorite player but more often than not, even in the most neutral & unrelated football discussions, these two names pop up and you will be forced to take a side. There is a crazy subset of fans among-st them that treat rest of the players/contenders as rubbish and bring out the hate-artillery for little reason.",0

Culture, race and national identity in Brazil,” Lilia Moritz Schwarcz, Centre for Brazilian Studies, University of Oxford, 2003. Why you should read this: In 1976, researchers conducted a national population survey in Brazil that asked people to self-describe their “color.” They got 136 different responses, including “cinnamon,” “lilac” and “sea blue.” To read every fascinating one of them, check out this working paper. Source: “The whitening Of Neymar: How color is lived in Brazil,” Achal Prabhala, Deadspin, July 8, 2014. Why you should read this: The 2014 World Cup was supposed to be racism-free. After all, host country Brazil is known for its racial diversity both on the soccer field and off … right? Of course, the reality is far more complicated, as this article illustrates via photos of Neymar. Excerpt: “You could conclude that race doesn’t exist in Brazil, which is the favorite line of a specific tribe of Brazilians — impeccable liberals all, who just happen to be upper-class, white, and at the top of the heap. Or you could conclude that everyone in Brazil is indeed mixed — which is, incidentally, the second-favorite line of the selfsame tribe … There is this: When asked if he had ever been a victim of racism, [Neymar] said, “Never. Neither inside nor outside the field. Because I’m not black, right?” Actually, the word he used was preto, which is significant, since, in Brazil, when used as a color ascribed to people — rather than things, like rice or beans — it is the rough equivalent of the n-word, negro and negra being the acceptable ways of describing someone who is truly black (and moreno or morena being standard descriptors for someone dark-skinned, as well as, occasionally, euphemisms for blackness). Technically speaking, however, his logic was faultless — and even kind of interestingly honest: The Neymar who made that statement was an unworldly 18-year-old who had never lived outside Brazil. And in Brazil, Neymar is not black.” Source: “Black identity and racism collide in Brazil,” Dion Rabouin, The Root, June 17, 2014. Why you should read this: Slavery in Brazil wasn’t abolished until 1888. By then, 4 million people of African descent were living in Brazil. While U.S. post-slavery laws segregated black and white communities, Brazil encouraged the integration and mixing of African and European families instead. Today, the country’s urban neighborhoods are still somewhat divided by class and race, but multiracial heritage is also the norm — and multiracial racism is anything but black and white. This article in The Root, a leading news and culture site for African-American influencers, explains Brazil’s race issues to a U.S. audience. Excerpt: “Brazil has a complex past and present when it comes to race. That complexity can perhaps best be illustrated by the fact that many black Brazilians don’t think of themselves as black. Brazilian soccer star Neymar is a great example … This denial of blackness may seem confusing to many Americans, because despite his long, straightened and occasionally blond hair, Neymar is clearly black. (Take a look at a picture of young Neymar with his family.) But for Brazilians, being black is very different from what it is in the United States … Integration and miscegenation were actually government policy in Brazil. Around the time that slaves were freed, in 1888, the government sought to whiten its population through the importation of European immigrants. This idea was made law by Decree 528 in 1890 and opened the country’s borders to foreign immigrants, except for those from Africa and Asia.” Source: “Inter-relations: Brazilian soccer and society,” Luiz Costa-Lima, professor of Comparative Literature in Universidade do estado do Rio de Janeiro, 1998. Why you should read this: For half a century after soccer was brought to Brazil from England in the late 1800s, Brazilian soccer teams were primarily white and wealthy. This academic paper explores the legacy of “social whiteness” in Brazilian soccer. Excerpt: “The initial phase of soccer in Brazil has been characterized as a practice confined to the descendants of upper-class native families and well-established foreigners, usually Englishmen. Since Brazilian society officially ignored racial discrimination … the initial predominance of white players in Brazilian soccer stemmed from social criteria.” Source: “Race in another America: The significance of skin color in Brazil,” Edward E. Telles, Princeton University Press, June 30, 2004. Why you should read this: For one of the most frequently cited scholarly works on racism in Brazil, read this book. Excerpt: “While a history of blatant and legal racism has undoubtedly contributed to making race an important area of study in the United States, racism in Brazil has generally been more subtle, and legal racial segregation has not existed since slavery. Indeed, the dominant assumption from Du Bois’ time until recent years has been that race does not really matter in Brazil…While it is becoming increasingly clear that racism is a universal phenomenon, it is less accepted that its manifestations may vary widely. Are the nature and levels of racial inequalities the same? Surely, history, politics, class structure, culture, and ideology are very distinct between the Brazil and the United States. Should these not have also affected the development of a distinct system of race relations?” + How the World Cup can make or break Brazil’s hopes for the future: Misha Glenny on the country that’ll host TEDGlobal 2014: Featured image by Amil Delic/Flickr.",0

They are now second from bottom, having failed to score in six of their last nine games. It doesn’t help that three of their players were instrumental in setting other Ligue 1 teams up for victory. Martin Terrier, on loan at Strasbourg, set up one of Nuno Da Costa’s two goals in a 2-1 victory at Nice, while Xeka did the same for Dijon in their vital win at Metz, with Naim Sliti scored the winner early in the second half. All have been superb this season, with Sliti in particular ensuring that Dijon’s attack hasn’t suffered too greatly in the absences of Lois Diony and Pierre Lees-Melou. Coupled with the late sale of Nicolas De Préville (who remains Lille’s leading scorer two months on from moving to Bordeaux), the strong performances of this trio of loanees have further called into question the wisdom of Bielsa.

With this result coming on the heels of their last home match, a 1-0 loss to Troyes, things are looking grim indeed for the club, who have dismissed Philippe Hinschberger. Results have not been good – they have lost nine of their 10 matches so far this season – but Hinschberger was a popular figure at the club. They only finished six points above the relegation zone last season and were indebted to the goalscoring prowess Cheick Diabaté, who scored eight goals in 12 starts on loan but wasn’t retained permanently this summer despite Metz having money from the sale of the young winger Ismaila Sarr. Instead, Emmanuel Rivière and Nolan Roux were brought in; they have combined for just four goals in more than a thousand minutes played. Metz were able to avoid relegation last year on the strength of a half-decent attack but now, without a reliable goalscorer, they are not only bottom of the league but have France’s poorest attack. Hinschberger had perhaps run out of rope, as discipline has been an issue as well, but the club’s hierarchy, seemingly well-positioned four months ago with the lucrative sale of Sarr, should be taking more of the blame.",0

 * Most selfish player in the top tier(0.00001%). Neymar’s terrible decisions in the interest of scoring are costing him and his teams. His last game against Real Madrid(CL 2018) is a classic example.
 * Ball and glory Hog. I got so much hate for saying this but I say it again. FFS, realize that you’re already regarded as the best footballer after those two.
 * Forget about winning, he lost fans because of his silly fights with Cavani, Semedo and other colleagues.
 * Neymar doesn’t respect his opponents. I guess you have some classic examples for this. Neymar had done it time and again with Barcelona and PSG.
PS : Football fans like me enjoy(or used to) his games because he is a genius at ball. But his on-field instincts like diving, fighting etc makes it less fun to watch him play. Most of the times I already know he is going to go down whenever someone comes close to him.",0

1445103568596480006,Neymar is a lazy toad,"If it’s just about not falling in line with socially mandated politeness, the reason could be an attraction towards cognitive independence. If you look up developmental theories, you will learn that the adult ego continues to develop and, at a certain point, we move away from accepting societal rules as they come and we question them. In some cases, like politeness, we might question their need entirely.

Patterns of abuse happen to different people, they don’t necessarily tap into a predisposition to allow abuse to happen because of a subconcious (malignious and wrong, obviusly) need to prove that we are worthless.",0
1445103568596480006,Neymar is a lazy toad,"There is also a simpler read, which is that this patriarchal society, still embued with toxic masculinity, worked on your perception and desires and made you subject to internalised mysoginy, which is quite common for both men and women.

Chris Brown is one of the most repulsive human beings alive. The fact that Chris Brown is still relevant and the media has left behind his awful actions, which are still happening as recent as last year with his ex-girlfriend as reported on by Daily Mail, is a tragedy in of itself. Let’s start at the beginning though.",0
1445092113000058901,"No, not #Lizzo too.  Chris Brown is a fucking abusive woman beating piece of shit.","For all three people who don’t know, Chris Brown is a rapper, producer, singer, dancer, and just about everything else in the book. He began his musical career in the early 2000s with his debut album titled Chris Brown, after himself, a record that has hit double platinum as years go on. Since that album, Chris Brown has received numerous awards including a Grammy, a World Music award, and even a Kid’s Choice Award (if only 2000s kids could see the mistake they made). To this day, Chris Brown has collaborated with some of the biggest names in music, like Drake, Wiz Khalifa, and even with DJ Khaled beginning in 2016. If one does not know the personal history of Chris Brown then they might say, “Wow, that’s quite an impressive career.” And it is. However, all of his accomplishments are diminished by his private actions.",0
1445092113000058901,"No, not #Lizzo too.  Chris Brown is a fucking abusive woman beating piece of shit.","In 2009, Chris Brown and his girlfriend at the time, pop singer Rihanna, got into an argument which lead to Chris physically assaulting her as originally reported by Daily News in 2009. The attack was so bad that Rihanna required hospitalization after the attack. Chris was described as having no injuries or scratches on him, according to police officers who were present when he turned himself in six hours after the attack. Of course, this was after he ran from police when they arrived at the scene of the incident. Pictures came out after the attack of Rihanna’s condition as well. It was horrifying. The media had a complete view of Chris Brown’s temper now. Did that change anything? Did Chris Brown get charged and put in jail for his disturbing actions? Of course not. He received a plea deal of community labor, five years of probation, and domestic violence counseling. Just a slap on the wrist.",0
1445092113000058901,"No, not #Lizzo too.  Chris Brown is a fucking abusive woman beating piece of shit.","After this incident, Chris Brown shared his feelings about the situation on Larry King Live on September 2, 2009: “I’m in shock, because, first of all, that’s not who I am as a person, and that’s not who I promise I want to be.” Oh really, Chris? Are you not a short-tempered, woman-assaulting scumbag? In fact, you even said that you have no memory of the incident occurring! Sorry Chris, but that excuse doesn’t cut it; you beat a woman so badly that she was hospitalized and you don’t remember it? That’s a lie and you should be downright ashamed of yourself for claiming that. Some of Chris Brown’s defenders dismiss the whole thing by citing his apology. How does that undo the damage done to Rihanna? Not only does she have to remember the pain you put her through and have what you did to her plastered all over the news, but she has to live with the mental scarring that domestic abuse does to a person. The other point raised by the defenders is that, apparently, “Rihanna and Chris Brown made up! They guest-starred on each other’s songs now!”. Whoopty doo, that does absolutely nothing to address the fact that he got off with no prison time for beating up his partner. “Innocent until proven guilty” obviously doesn’t apply here, because CHRIS BROWN PLED GUILTY TO THE CHARGES! So no, Chris Brown doesn’t get a free pass.",0
1445092113000058901,"No, not #Lizzo too.  Chris Brown is a fucking abusive woman beating piece of shit.","However, the media certainly gave him a free pass. In fact, he suffered no real negative consequences because of his actions. The next album he released later that same year sold over 300,000 copies which was also nominated for 2 Grammy Awards. Some radio stations boycotted his music but most did not. His acting career didn’t take a hit either; he was still getting roles in films such as Takers and appeared on TV shows like Tosh.0. But maybe he did change then, maybe he saw what this backlash could have been and maybe he really did mean his apology. Nope. On Good Morning America in 2011, Chris Brown had a temper tantrum about being asked about the assault (some people will call it an incident, even though he straight up attacked a woman). He ended up throwing something at the window during a commercial break, which damaged the window. Not a violent person, Chris?",0
1445092113000058901,"No, not #Lizzo too.  Chris Brown is a fucking abusive woman beating piece of shit.","Now flash forward ahead to 2011 to when Chris Brown began dating a new woman named Karrueche Tran. Karrueche is a actress and model who has had an off and on relationship with Chris Brown, but currently off for the rest of eternity. They eventually split after the revelation that Chris Brown had a child with another woman. So not only is Chris Brown a short tempered, violent scumbag, he is also a cheater too. He just gets better and better. So after their final breakup Chris Brown began getting aggressive with her (a very common theme) and demanding that she return everything he gave her. When she refused, Chris Brown then threatened her with violence. According to Karrueche, Chris even texted her “Bitch I will beat the shit out of you” as reported by TMZ and The Guardian. You did not learn. Seriously, fuck you Chris Brown. Tran also claimed that Chris had abused her before in the past. I believe her 100%. Chris has a violent past and has committed the same crime before. Thankfully Karrueche got a restraining order against the monster for 5 years. Sadly Chris Brown isn’t behind bars and rotting in a cell where he belongs. This restraining order incident only happened one year ago.",0
1445092113000058901,"No, not #Lizzo too.  Chris Brown is a fucking abusive woman beating piece of shit.","Why bring this up now though? This is all old news. Well, Chris Brown is still making music. This year in March, Chris Brown even went double platinum with comedy rapper Lil Dicky. I heard their song “Freaky Friday” for the first time two months ago, awhile after it came out. I wish I had heard it sooner. For those who haven’t heard the song, it is all about Lil Dicky switching bodies with Chris Brown and realizing how great it is being Chris Brown. The entire point of the song can be summed up with the line of Chris Brown realizing that he loves himself. Yes, the entire point of the song is to teach Chris Brown to love himself! That isn’t even the worst moment in the song. By far the line that actually made me spit out my drink was when Chris Brown, in the body of Lil Dicky (a scrawny white Jewish boy), says, “Ain’t nobody judging ’cause I’m black or my controversial past, I can go to see a movie and relax!” I am at a loss for words. Controversial? There’s nothing controversial about it! You, Chris Brown, beat up 2 woman – one of them multiple times – got a restraining order against you, and are a despicable piece of human garbage. Boom, nothing controversial about that!",0

Only half the album contains actual songs, the other side consists of the orchestral soundtrack music written by George Martin.
And of those songs, 2 are repeated from previous albums and the other 4 are a mishmash at best. A couple of half-rejected George Harrison numbers, a singalong ditty that was probably written in 5 minutes and then “Hey, Bulldog”, which is one the band’s hardest rocking songs and a somewhat overlooked classic.
Apart from that one great song, I actually prefer the second side. George Martin wrote a beautiful and very evocative score, and I like that I can just let it play all the way through instead of getting annoyed over hearing songs I’ve already heard elsewhere before.",0
1445092113000058901,"No, not #Lizzo too.  Chris Brown is a fucking abusive woman beating piece of shit.","12. Beatles for Sale - By their own admission, the Beatles were fucking exhausted by the point of this album’s recording. Constant touring and the nightmare of living through Beatlemania meant that they hadn’t had sufficient time or energy to write new material, so nearly half of the album was padded out with cover songs.
Both the original and the cover songs are a real mixed bag.
You have wonderful originals in “I’m a Loser” and “I’ll Follow the Sun” but also more average songs like “Baby’s in Black” and “Every Little Thing”.
Then you have the definitive version of Chuck Berry’s “Rock and Roll Music” and the superb “Kansas City/Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey” medley. But also the godawful “Honey Don’t” and the frankly boring “Everybody’s Trying to Be My Baby”.
It’s not an awful album by any means, but perhaps due to circumstances beyond the band’s control, it’s easily the patchiest release they ever gave us, and as such, simply cannot compete with the rest.",0
1445092113000058901,"No, not #Lizzo too.  Chris Brown is a fucking abusive woman beating piece of shit.","11. Please Please Me - I have a real soft spot for this album. Not only was it recorded in a single day, but John Lennon also suffered from a bad cold, which is not ideal at the best of times. But despite these setbacks, the band still managed to give us a handful of classics with “I Saw Her Standing There”, “Love Me Do” and the title track. And if that wasn’t enough, they also recorded great versions of “Anna (Go to Him)” and “Baby It’s You”, not to mention the utterly brilliant rendition of “Twist and Shout” which still sounds raw and exciting to this day.
The main reason for the album’s low ranking is the same as the reason why I like it.
The band wasn’t given enough time to deliver a polished product that did the songs justice, and it was only because they knew this material inside and out that they were able to perform the songs as well as they did.",0
1445092113000058901,"No, not #Lizzo too.  Chris Brown is a fucking abusive woman beating piece of shit.","10. A Hard Day’s Night - Probably a controversial placement for this classic album; the first of only original songs the Beatles released. And I must admit that there were a couple of other albums I though about putting in its place. But I ultimately went with this one because I think that despite containing several immortal masterpiece songs, it also has more filler on it than most of their other albums do.
The title track, “I should Have Known Better”, “Can’t Buy Me Love”, “Things We Said Today” and “You Can’t Do That” are all incredible songs. But then there’s also stuff like “And I Love Her” and “If I Fell”, both of which are highly regarded but which I find terribly dull and overrated. Furthermore, you have trash like “Tell Me Why” and “I’ll Cry Instead”, which are the very definition of filler. But worst of all is George’s horrible “I’m Happy Just to Dance with You”, which is beneath what anyone should be allowed to play or forced to listen to.",0
1445092113000058901,"No, not #Lizzo too.  Chris Brown is a fucking abusive woman beating piece of shit.","9. Rubber Soul - Definitely a controversial place to put this classic, which to many is their favourite Beatles album. It’s not one of mine. As always, I think there are a handful of incredible songs, but this one is also filled with lesser material that never would’ve gained the popularity it did if it wasn’t associated with the Beatles, in my opinion.
“Drive My Car”, “The Word” and “In My Life” are the real highlights here. Other songs like “Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown), “Nowhere Man” and “Girl” are pleasant. but grossly overrated, if you ask me.
I do like “Michelle” quite a bit, however. Certainly when compared with garbage like “What Goes On” and “Wait”.",0

Help! - Similar in proportion to the later “Rubber Soul”, this album also offers a mix of the superb, the average and the shit. The difference being that the overall quality is higher than on the other release.
The title track, “You’ve Got to Hide Your Love Away”, “Ticket to Ride” and “Yesterday” are all worthy of their reputation, and “The Night Before”, “You’re Going to Lose That Girl” and “I’ve Just Seen a Face” are all very well written songs.
But then we also have the offensively bad “I Need You” and “Dizzy Miss Lizzy” to ruin an otherwise fine package. I do like Ringo’s take on “Act Naturally”, though.",0
1445092113000058901,"No, not #Lizzo too.  Chris Brown is a fucking abusive woman beating piece of shit.","7. Let it Be - Nobody could blame the Beatles for not making this a perfect album. The conditions under which it was made was, by most accounts, fairly terrible.
They no longer wanted to work together and couldn’t agree on what to do, creatively. And on top of that, mad Phil Spector was given free reigns to do as he pleased with what they did record.
In spite of this, there’s a lot of good stuff on here.
The title track, “Dig a Pony”, “The Long and Winding Road” and “Get Back” are all amazing, and many of the other songs, like “Two of Us”, “Across the Universe” and “One After 909” are really rather excellent as well.
The problem is more that the songs sound like rehearsal takes rather than the finished product, and lazy songs like “For You Blue” and “I Me Mine” certainly don’t help one overlook that flaw.",0

And the reason for that is that, while it may not contain as many drop dead classic songs as some of the other albums, there’s also no crap to be found here.
Both the original and the cover songs are of a consistently high quality and always interesting to listen to. And that counts in my book.
“All My Loving” was the big hit, but I think “It Won’t Be Long” is the true classic here. And both George and John deliver severely underrated compositions with the likes of “Don’t Bother Me” and “Not a Second Time”.
Then there’s also fantastic covers of “Please Mr. Postman” and “You’ve Really Got a Hold on Me” as well as the hard rocking “Money (That’s What I Want)” which gives the band’s classic cover of “Twist and Shout” a run for its money.

It broke a lot of new ground and alongside the Beach Boys’ “Pet Sounds” essentially elevated the pop album to the level of high art.
But I don’t care about that! I judge the songs as I hear them, and as such, I can safely say that half of this album is probably among the best pop music I’ve ever heard, and the other half I never need to hear again. It’s a neat split, right down the middle.
“Taxman”, “Eleanor Rigby”, “She Said She Said”. “And Your Bird Can Sing” and “Tomorrow Never Knows” are the good ones. Nay, GREAT ones.
“Here, There and Everywhere”, “For No One” and “Good Day Sunshine” can fuck off.",0

Magical Mystery Tour - Originally released as a double EP and later fleshed out with a handful of singles that had nowhere better to go, this album really has no right to be as good as it is. The fact that the first side of songs is dedicated to a misguided surreal bit of nonsense film that nobody in their right mind actually likes would normally be cause for concern, but then again, we’re not dealing with a normal band here, and surprise surprise, the songs are all wonderful.
The title track, “The Fool on the Hill” and “I Am the Walrus” are all stone cold classics. And if that wasn’t enough, side 2 is where things REALLY get going with the double whammy of “Strawberry Fields Forever” and “Penny Lane” joining forces with “Hello Goodbye” and “All You Need is Love”.
Oh my god…",0

Consisting mainly of songs written individually by the band members while in India, and pretty much recorded without everyone ever appearing at the same time in the studio together, it should be a complete mess of an album.
And it is! But that’s also what’s so great about it. It contains a bewilderingly broad collection of different styles and genres which truly demonstrate the sheer width and scope of the Beatles’ influences and talents.
There are almost too many songs to mention, but “Dear Prudence”, the unfairly underrated “Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da”, “While My Guitar Gently Weeps” and “Birthday” are all among the best stuff the band ever did. And then they also took things further by arguably inventing hard rock with “Helter Skelter”, years before Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin did. Plus the sheer audacity of including a highly abstract and experimental epic like “Revolution 9” means that, as a Frank Zappa fan, I can but smile at the “Fuck you” attitude of it all and join in with the fun.
This is the Beatles’ punk album, and that’s a very good thing, indeed.",0
1445092113000058901,"No, not #Lizzo too.  Chris Brown is a fucking abusive woman beating piece of shit.","2. Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band - Yeah yeah, you all know this one. Routinely cited as the greatest album ever made. And I might even agree with that if the Beatles never made an album that’s even better.
Still, it’s arguably the most important album ever made. The promise showed on “Revolver” came to fruition on this one and all the talent, inspiration and creativity in the universe seemed to explode on this one piece of vinyl for the world to behold in awe.
There’s not a bad track on it. Nothing you’d want to skip or ever could feel bored with. I could name individual standouts, I suppose, but that would only mean that I’d ignore some of the other songs, and that would be very unfair.
Let’s just say that the two songs that most people seem to dislike the most, “Within You Without You” and “When I’m 64”, are still yet two more perfect examples of the Beatles’ fearless approach to discovering and reinventing their sound.
And the album cover alone is a lesson in how it’s done! Endlessly fascinating and enriching, this album belongs in anyone’s collection.",0
1445092113000058901,"No, not #Lizzo too.  Chris Brown is a fucking abusive woman beating piece of shit.","1. Abbey Road - This is my favourite Beatles album by quite an extreme margin. And there are many reasons for that. 
Not only is there not a weak moment to be found (not a nanosecond is wasted) but the band’s abilities as musicians and singers seem to have somehow magically jumped up about a thousand notches, and as writers, they never surpassed the heights they reached here.
Every member is on top form. John bringing cool with “Come Together” and progressive psycho jazz with “I Want You (She’s So Heavy)”, Paul goofy fun with “Maxwell’s Silver Hammer” and raw passion with “Oh Darling” and George some beauty with “Something” and “Here Comes the Sun”. Even Ringo (with the help of George) shows up with the instantly catchy “Octopus’s Garden” which features one of the best guitar intros in history.
And speaking of history, the long medley on the second side of the album is justifiably famous for being what many (including me) considers to be the band’s crowning achievement.
As with previous albums, it really shouldn’t work as well as it does. There’s no unifying theme holding these songs together. They’re all completely unrelated to one another and as different from each other as could ever be imagined. And yet, thanks to the sheer skill with which they’ve been recorded, performed and glued together, they all help to form an extended piece of music that is more than the sum of its parts.
You cannot remove a single note from anywhere without completely spoiling the magic. And yet, the finished result is divinely strong and proof, if proof was ever needed, that pop music has the power to move us all to the very core of our beings.
Abbey Road is a monumental achievement. Right up there with Pink Floyd’s “Dark Side of the Moon”. And whether it’s the greatest album of all time or not is, to me, completely irrelevant.
This kind of greatness is beyond criticism.",0

Blood On The Dance Floor - Lazy effort released by the company for monetary gain. 5 ‘new’ songs (which are actually bloody good) followed by a bunch of shit remixes of songs from HIStory which was done for the European market as they like that crap. Having said that, the Tony Miran HIStory remix is very, very good. Best selling remix album of all time,
2. Thriller - not enough songs on it, best selling album of all time.
3. Off The Wall - Don’t like Disco music, but this album is fantastic and Michaels voice, the melodies and the timelessness of it is outstanding
4. Bad - the songs on this album are incredible, I love the whole era and image, and Dirty Diana is an all time favourite
5. HIStory - Outstanding album. First disc is another boring complication though this time picked by MJ himself. I would replace half of them with completely different choices myself. Second disc has some incredible music on it - They Don’t Care About Us, This Time Around, Earth Song, Tabloid Junkie and Little Susie to name a few. Loved the tour, didn’t like the change of look, but the military thing was still very cool. Best selling double album of all time.
6. Invincible - extremely underrated album due to Michael not wanting to tour it, and Sony mugging him off and refusing to promote anything to do with it in return. Sold a shit load anyway, more than most people, but slow for his standards. Sold a lot by now I think. I think this is a masterpiece and is a lot rougher and industrial sounding than his other efforts. Distinct lack of Hee Hee’s and other MJ noises for my liking, but still, the music speaks for itself. Invincible holds gems such as Unbreakable, 2000 Watts, Whatever Happens, Butterflies and The Lost Children.
7. Dangerous - for me, his best album. His single most creative effort that was way ahead of its time. Everything from the album cover, to the image, the short-films, tour, costumes, adverts….head and shoulders above everything else. 14 tracks of perfection, the most he did at the point, ranging from New Jack Swing, to hard rock, piano ballads and even Gospel. Absolutely timeless incredible album which even out sold Bad which was the follow up to Thriller and was monstrous in itself. Dangerous houses Give In To Me featuring Slash of Guns N Roses and is my favourite song which eventually led me to rock and metal, my newest passions.",0

Perhaps one of the worst accusations is that Kelly kept black teenage girls in a demented sex cult, grooming them, abusing them, and having them cut off all contact with friends and family to become his personal slaves. A 2019 BBC documentary found evidence that Kelly kept 14-year-old girls as ""pets,"" a term that probably sums up all you need to know about his view of women.

She still accused an artist who had never done anything to her just because he happened to be Asian. Would it have happened if he were white?",0

But her personality comes across as very spoiled and bratty to me. Grammys, however…and the problem with many award shows is that they don't tend to take the artist’s character into account. This is very unlike Eastern artists, where the usage of drugs or you being rude to people can effectively end your career in days. Everything is very heavily based on your character. That is how eastern society is. Especially for korean celebrities, most will bow the the cameramen and ordinary people. Frankly they aren't perfect either. Many eastern celebrities have made mistakes. Some may say it's very stressful but I would rather take a good image over a nasty one. I am sure you would too. Kendrick Lamar, like his album, is humble even though he won a prestigious award.",0
