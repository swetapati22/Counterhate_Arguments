As if no celebrity is selfish and none want to come in the cover page . And Ronaldo is not only a selfish player on ground but outside the ground as he had a string of hot girlfriends.

Who don't like to have tattoos to make himself able to donate blood.,0
745590311120932864,shut the fuck up!! Ronaldo is wayyyyy better See-no-evil monkey Messi is selfish and a dickhead,"No question. Some of that is the nature of the beast. However, at this point his ego is bigger than his form on the field. It was alarming that he insisted on taking free kicks with the likes of Pjanic and Dybala in the Juve lineup. While R-7 has scored more FKs over his career, both P & D have been much more dangerous in recent years. He took an inordinate amount of shots last year. While he got his goals, his strike rate was among the worst in Europe. His is a power game, and in Serie A, defenders don’t allow him the time to uncork shots. The result, blocked shots and too many rushed shots far off target. His crossover dribbling worked only against lower level teams. He rarely showed the type of speed to create separation he once did. I believe he only scored two goals outside from area from the run of play, despite no shortage of attempts.",0
745590311120932864,shut the fuck up!! Ronaldo is wayyyyy better See-no-evil monkey Messi is selfish and a dickhead,"The antics that got him redcarded in his first CL match with Juve may be more arrogance than selfishness, but it’s a matter of semantics. He pulled similar antics later in the season. He frequently shows up his teammates after an errant pass. I find his post-goal celebrations to be childish, but they are part of the R-7 act. Just once it would be nice to seem him act as if he’s scored before, or possibly direct some attention to the player providing a key pass. Unfortunately, he has been conditioned and enabled to keep the spotlight all to himself.",0
745590311120932864,shut the fuck up!! Ronaldo is wayyyyy better See-no-evil monkey Messi is selfish and a dickhead,"Full disclosure. I opposed his signing. I have seen nothing to date that proves it was the right move - on the field. Juve won the previous 7 straight Serie A titles without him. IMHO, his goals have come at the expense of others - most notably Dybala. I don’t root against him or Juve, but I finf I get far more pleasure from victories when others score.",0
745590311120932864,shut the fuck up!! Ronaldo is wayyyyy better See-no-evil monkey Messi is selfish and a dickhead,"Not to bash him or anything, ’cause his perceived selfishness gets him to score more goals, but he does come across as a selfish player. You just get the feeling it’s about him more than the team, particularly when things aren’t going their way. He’s been accused of being ‘salty’ whenever he doesn’t get on the scoresheet, appearing to sulk rather than be happy for his teammates.",0
745590311120932864,shut the fuck up!! Ronaldo is wayyyyy better See-no-evil monkey Messi is selfish and a dickhead,"Regardless, like I said, some of his supposed negative traits are probably what push him to perform more than most, making him one of the best players of his generation.",0
745590311120932864,shut the fuck up!! Ronaldo is wayyyyy better See-no-evil monkey Messi is selfish and a dickhead,"He wants to win and he wants to score. He is the main man, and if he doesn't live up to that, he becomes angry with himself. In recent events Ronaldo appears to put his hand up after Morata scores, however this was not done in a selfish manner and he celebrated with the team happily. But he can be selfish in terms of always wanting to be passed too when near goal (not happy with others taking a shot at goal and missing).",0
745590311120932864,shut the fuck up!! Ronaldo is wayyyyy better See-no-evil monkey Messi is selfish and a dickhead,I assume we are talking about play style and not that “he takes care of his mother” type of selfishness. He certainly was a selfish player in the sense that he was the one going for the goal.,0

745590311120932864,shut the fuck up!! Ronaldo is wayyyyy better See-no-evil monkey Messi is selfish and a dickhead,"Oh yes, I would definitely regard him as a selfish player. You can see this in his antics on the pitch, especially with his national team (whose standard is quite a bit lower than Real Madrid’s). During the Euros, his body language was very expressive, very over the top, suggesting that he felt it was all on him. However, I don't think this detracts from his leadership qualities, when the going got tough, his teammates would look to him for inspiration, and often he would provide it. Not just with goals, but with a gut-busting run or pinpoint cross which leads to a goal as well. Sometimes he even provides inspiration from the bench ;)",0
745590311120932864,shut the fuck up!! Ronaldo is wayyyyy better See-no-evil monkey Messi is selfish and a dickhead,"I think ronaldo is just an extremely passionate and determined player, unfortunately he does come across as quite narcissistic and arrogant. There is also a lack of modesty and professionalism in his game at times (Rooney incident for example) which makes it easier for people to dislike him, but when you have that passion (Drogba is a good example) sometimes you upset people.",0

745590311120932864,shut the fuck up!! Ronaldo is wayyyyy better See-no-evil monkey Messi is selfish and a dickhead,This is the map which shows all of the penalty targets aimed by the Argentinian Lionel Messi.,0
745590311120932864,shut the fuck up!! Ronaldo is wayyyyy better See-no-evil monkey Messi is selfish and a dickhead,"* Total penalties - 103
 * Successful - 79
 * Missed - 24
 * Conversion Rate - 76.5%
1. By taking a good look and examining it, we can arrive at the fact that his target areas are both towards right and left sides of the goalkeeper And, are scattered but dominantly he aims for the left side of the goalkeeper.
2. It’s clear that he often tries different approaches instead of going to his natural side which is actually good, making his moves unpredictable to the goalie but, being a Messi fan what irritates me most is that he hits them more towards goalkeepers reach, and rarely goes for side netting unlike his Real Madrid arch rival.
Now let's have a look at the Portuguese star Cristiano Ronaldo.",0
745590311120932864,shut the fuck up!! Ronaldo is wayyyyy better See-no-evil monkey Messi is selfish and a dickhead,Ronaldo’s penalty map,0
745590311120932864,shut the fuck up!! Ronaldo is wayyyyy better See-no-evil monkey Messi is selfish and a dickhead,"* Total penalties - 123
 * Successful - 104
 * Missed - 19
 * Conversion Rate - 86%
1. By analyzing the above map it’s clear that Ronaldo aims more towards low and wide areas and is more dominant towards goalkeeper’s right hand side which is Ronaldo's natural side.
2. From 12yards out Ronaldo's unique aspect is his placement. Almost 16% of his total goals have come from penalties and the conversion rate is astonishing.
3. The unique feature about his kicks is that he goes more towards the side netting unlike Messi, his placement is concentrated and far away from goalkeeper’s reach.
4. Run up and power- Ronaldo's run-up is something that I really admire, his technique is amazing as he approaches the ball he kind off gets on his toes and prepares himself for the launch of the ball, his run up and his technique imparts power to the ball unlike Messi's small run-up which somewhat imparts less speed and power to the ball.

Ronaldo is wayyyyy better See-no-evil monkey Messi is selfish and a dickhead,"One must leave behind a home — in Messi's case, the only home he has ever known, having come up through the Barcelona youth system.Often, one needs to learn a new language.People who were rivals turn friends.If the rumours about Messi moving to Paris Saint-Germain are true, he has already made a start where finding friends is concerned. He was photographed hanging out in Ibiza with Neymar, Marco Verratti, Angel di Maria and Leandro Paredes.And why does everything change for the fans?I’m not entirely sure. Perhaps it has something to do with having to choose between a favourite player and a favourite team. The team is not the same anymore. And there’s a chance the player who once saw “your” team through to win after win, will now stand between the team and the trophies he once won them. And yet he will be as beautiful to watch on the field as ever, except he will not look the same.It is disorientating—and sometimes heart-breaking—to watch someone in the “wrong kit” for the first time.One of Jerry Seinfeld’s funniest, and yet most profound sketches, has this to offer about being a team fan:“Loyalty to any one sports team is pretty hard to justify. Because the players are always changing, the team can move to another city, you’re actually rooting for the clothes when you get right down to it. You know what I mean, you’re standing and cheering and yelling for your clothes to beat the clothes from another city. Fans will be so in love with a player, but if he goes to another team, they boo him. This is the same human being in a different shirt, they hate him now. Boo! Different shirt. Boo!”The lines are so true they make you laugh.But when it actually happens, it is ugly to watch and likely terrifying to experience.When Luis Figo moved from Barcelona to Real Madrid, he was labelled a “traitor” for the sacrilege. Debris would find its way to him every time the two teams met, and sometimes when they didn’t.Lionel Messi was among the reasons I, as a fan, made the equally sacrilegious move from Real Madrid to Barcelona. In the early 2000s, Real Madrid’s management made a host of decisions that left fans feeling betrayed. First, they broke up the sparkling combination of Raul and Morientes, discarding the latter for stars and the merchandise they would sell. Soon enough, Real Madrid began to look like a World’s Best XI, with the who’s who from each team. Brazil’s Ronaldo came, and David Beckham and eventually Cristiano Ronaldo. The likes of Morientes and Fernando Hierro were sent off unceremoniously. Some years later, Raul would follow. The tradition of treating players poorly continues, right up to Iker Casillas. How can one, in good conscience, remain a fan of a team that discards the people who made one a fan of the team?In the meanwhile, Barcelona would focus on building a team. Stars came, but only the ones who fitted in. And the youth system gave them stars too, men who had once been boys in blue and pink and would go on to become forces on the international stage.Messi will be vilified for his choice. Why is money so important, Barcelona fans will ask, how can you betray the team?We often forget that the relationship between a player and a team must be mutual. How loyal are teams to their players?There is a handful of players who remained in one club all their lives, like Paolo Maldini for AC Milan and Ryan Giggs for Manchester United. There are others who spent their entire senior careers in one club, like Francesco Totti for Roma. Iker Casillas would have been among the Maldinis and Raul among the Tottis if not for what happened at Madrid. And Messi would have been a Maldini if the contract extension had worked. But there was simply no way it could work.Before Joan Laporta took over as President, things had come to such a pass that Messi nearly approached the courts to get out of his contract with the team.The fact that Barcelona was mismanaged is evident from the figure Laporta gave as their estimated loss over the past year — €487 million. Between the club’s financial problems and the La Liga’s salary cap rules, they can no longer afford to pay their talisman what he merits.And why should he settle for less? We often forget just how short the careers of sportsmen are. They play at the highest level for between 10 and 20 years — in extremely rare cases, 25. Often, they burn out. We speak of their “lavish” lifestyle, but one’s needs typically expand to suit one’s bank balance.International sport takes a physical toll. It takes a mental toll. It takes an emotional toll. And it often remains the one thing one can rely on — as manager or coach, perhaps.Messi’s leaving Barcelona is the end of an era. But it is not a selfish move. When one has given nearly three decades to a club at every level, moving on when the club will not support one is the sensible thing to do.",0

For Barcelona, they play more possession based football, with Messi dropping into a No. 10 role and becoming involved in the passing, making him seem more generous and unselfish.

745590311120932864,shut the fuck up!! Ronaldo is wayyyyy better See-no-evil monkey Messi is selfish and a dickhead,There's this idea that Ronaldo is Selfish while Messi is not. It's not as straightforward as it seems. Ronaldo takes a lot of shots. Around 5-6 shots for every 90 minutes of football he plays. That's marginally more than Messi’s numbers. Messi cannot take 5 shots per match without being selfish.,0
745590311120932864,shut the fuck up!! Ronaldo is wayyyyy better See-no-evil monkey Messi is selfish and a dickhead,"So, what's the difference? The difference is, Messi is very likely to pass to another player when he feels they are in better position. And Messi is generally right about that. His judgment in the game is probably the best of any player that ever played the game. The instance where Messi can score but chooses to pass only occurs when he's already scored in the game and wants to give the other guy an opportunity.",0
745590311120932864,shut the fuck up!! Ronaldo is wayyyyy better See-no-evil monkey Messi is selfish and a dickhead,"Being selfish is seen as this negative thing in football, but it has it's benefits. No one can convert every shot of theirs into goals on a consistent basis. If you want to score a brace/Hattrick, you have to take around 5-6 shots in the match. To take that many shots, you need to be in selfish positions and not pass the ball every time.",0
745590311120932864,shut the fuck up!! Ronaldo is wayyyyy better See-no-evil monkey Messi is selfish and a dickhead,"To put it clearly, whenever Messi decides that he wants to dribble past 4 guys and score, he's being selfish. And it doesn't matter because he generally accomplishes the end goal. When you fail to do that, you are hindering your team. Messi rarely fails. But regardless of success, there's an element of selfishness in it.",0

732737983133159424,"Nancy grace is a ignorant bitch, how does she still have a time slot on tv?",The trial has gone as follows:,0
732737983133159424,"Nancy grace is a ignorant bitch, how does she still have a time slot on tv?","* Day 1: witnesses from the street have been called to testify. The prosecution is taking an emotional approach, leading witnesses to say they felt sad and worried. They have asked the medical opinion from a security guard/MMA fighter. This is because he was telling the police that the hold they had on Floyd at the time was potentially deadly.
 * Day 2: They have continued to ask the same witness more about his opinions. The defense had that witness say that it is possible to wake up and begin fighting after they wake up from being choked out. Furthermore, the defense is arguing that his opinion is invalid since he has never worked in or trained law enforcement, so therefore doesn’t know other combat forms outside of his field. A firefighter woman who was there was also called. She was trying to instruct the police to check Floyd's pulse when he was on the ground - she was not in uniform at the time of the event. The defense is arguing that the woman wasn’t and should not have been taken seriously as she was just another person on the street.
 * Day 3: The clerk at the store the event took place testified that that bill offered by Floyd was counterfeit. He said Floyd seemed high, but he was friendly. Another witness said he was trying to yell to Floyd to calm down and cooperate. Floyd wouldn't.
 * Day 4: Floyd's girlfriend (nickname: Mama) testified that Floyd was hospitalized in March for taking some bad drugs. He was there for a few days. The same drugs from then were potentially taken on May 25. Both paramedics who tended to Floyd were interviewed. When they arrived, they had no pulse on him. In the ambulance they had no pulse. He looked flat-lined in the ambulance. The hospital pronounced him dead. The sergeant was interviewed. There is a way to restrain a suspect which involves tying their legs and arms together and then turning them to their side so that they can breathe properly. These police did not do that, and instead kept him pinned causing potential deadly consequences. The defense is making the case it was so they could expedite the situation when the medics were to arrive.

He did not need a conscious intent “I’m going to kill this man.” It would be enough for him to have bias in the back of his mind that this was a large black man, twice his size, signifying to Chauvin that Floyd had great, wild-man strength that must be subdued with dirty tricks like knees on the neck. That would have led him to interpret Floyd’s struggling as more ‘wild black man’ behavior rather than a man desperately struggling to create space for his lungs so that they could work. The expert explaining this was very graphic. I knew exactly what he was talking about. I think Chauvin could have interpreted the cries for help as ‘crocodile tears’ and not believed them, also a stereotype in his head about black folks.",0

He’s charged with three things so the jury has a choice, and the odds of him being acquitted of all charges will be much less. I particularly like that ‘depraved mind” 3rd-degree charge. It will be excellent to have the implicit bias that may be at the bottom of his appalling behavior called that officially.

The reasons for my expecting that outcome are that:",0
732737983133159424,"Nancy grace is a ignorant bitch, how does she still have a time slot on tv?","* Mr Chauvin effectively caused the death of Mr Floyd by kneeling on his neck for more than 9 minutes while he was handcuffed — an eminently dangerous act, especially if performed for such an excessively long period of time;
 * even if such kneeling may in principle have been standard police restraint procedure in Minnesota, Mr Chauvin did it for an unnecessarily, excessively long period of time, more than 9 minutes, clearly without regard for Mr Floyd's life; and
 * by doing that, Mr Chauvin evinced a “depraved mind” -- I may be wrong but I thought that, according to the video evidence, the expression on Mr Chauvin's face while he was doing it, with his hands in his pockets, suggested exactly that.
Also:",0
732737983133159424,"Nancy grace is a ignorant bitch, how does she still have a time slot on tv?","* as an experienced police officer, Mr Chauvin would or should have been aware of the dangers of the restraint method he used on Mr Floyd, particularly if used for an excessively long period as he was doing it; and

 * He had a very violent past so making him appear sympathetic would be tough
 * He did say “I can't breathe"" a few times before and after being on the ground, however this is something shouted at every possible opportunity by druggies, bit of a boy who cried wild situation unfortunately, I'm not sure if yelling this will be very relevant going forward when 99.5% of the time the person getting arrested is just making trouble. A good defense could probably nullify this bit of evidence for at least one juror.
 * Chauvin doesn't really have much chance at being shown to be sympathetic either, his name has been drug through the mud so much he'll never be clean. Plenty of bad looking things to point to in his past, he's no saint and probably shouldn't have remained a cop without at least more training and mental health tests. However chances are at least one juror could potentially be swayed a bit towards him. Cops are naturally sympathetic, far more than meth users.
 * The whole situation was made uneededly stressful by a mob of hostile people, the other cops were almost certainly not paying attention to the guy on the ground who's not a threat, but to the hostile crowd who might become dangerous. And Chauvin was probably paying attention to the crowd as well.
 * Generally looks like the training in the department was piss poor.
 * Rioting and violence over his death is a divisive factor which will either increase or decrease likelihood to convict for each juror, since it needs to be unanimous this makes it very bad for chances of conviction. At least a couple of jurors will have a strong reaction to the violence and at least one will feel like pushing back against the media's general conclusion that he should be convicted.

To me it is crystal clear this woman is a sociopath and she certainly was involved in Kercher’s murder , if she did not kill her herself. Amanda Knox was convicted twice. Not once , but twice. Nobody is convicted twice if they are completely innocent. There was evidence against her that clearly incriminated her , hence the convictions.

There were zero external traces of a burglar outside the house. And how exactly a 4 kg stone made it to the second floor ? Impossible , based on the natural law of gravity. What was believed to be the murder weapon was found in Sollecito ‘s apartment. The victim ‘s DNA was found on the blade of the knife and Knox’ s DNA was found on the handle, which , the presumed murder weapon , was found in Sollecito’s apartment , where Meredith had never been, and Sollecito clearly lied when he claimed that she pricked her hand with the knife when she had dinner at his house, where she had never been, hence , he LIED to the Police. Knox was seen buying bleach the morning after the murder and the woman who cleaned Sollecito ‘s apartment stated that it smelt like bleach that particular day even though he had particularly told her NOT to ever use bleach to clean his place. Knox and Sollecito changed their story multiple times, they lied about their computer activity, they could not come up with a coherent story , they contradicted one another , they deactivated their mobile phones on the murder night AND they were privy to information only a person who was involved in the murder could have been. How did Sollecito know that nothing was stolen from Filomena’s room even before the Police opened the door?

Rafaelle withdrew Amanda ‘s alibi when he said that she was not with him the entire night at which point she scapegoated an innocent man when she fingered Lumumba. She didn ’t recant her malicious and false allegation even when her boss Lumumba , who she knew was innocent, was in prison. Knox did not just accuse Lumumba under duress , she fabricated an elaborate and demonstrably false story about the night of the murder. Amanda cracked under a small amount of pressure. Most people , even under coercion, don’t imagine a vivid scenario, incriminating an innocent man. She had no qualms letting an INNOCENT man rot in prison and had a customer of his not seen by mere chance in a newspaper that Lumumba was suspect for the murder then he might have even been convicted. A Swiss businessman came forward to say he had been talking to Lumumba all night long the night the murder took place. Lumumba had an air tight alibi, Amanda Knox did not. Knox is a convicted criminal felon due to her false accusations against an innocent man. She is a convicted liar. Sollecito could NOT back up her alibi on the night of the murder AND he also refuted her claim that she had a shower the morning she returned home and found the door slightly ajar and blood in the bathroom yet she was not concerned AT ALL , she just assumed the blood was either from her recently pierced ears or her roommate’ period blood, which both claims are ridiculous , and she claimed she showered any way BUT Sollecito said she did not shower after all. If she knowingly lied about Lumumba then what else did she lie about? If she lied about Meredith always locking her door when in fact she didn ’t then what else did she lie about? If she lied about having a shower, when in fact she didn ’t , then what else did she lie about?",0

How could she have already known at the time? Rudy Guede , who was convicted of Kercher’s murder and sentenced to 16 years , pointed the finger at Knox and it was established in court that he did not act alone. Kercher had minimum defensive wounds which proves there were more than one attacker. The forensics made it clear he could not have acted alone and had at least 2 other people holding Kercher’ s arms out the way. She was stabbed and bruised over 50 times, she had less than 3 defensive wounds. Normally half of the wounds or more are defensive as the person is trying to block the knife or pull away or move around, people don't just let you stab them 20 times and not raise their hands unless they are being restrained. The 3 defensive wounds are consistent with when her hand slipped away from someone who was supposed to be holding it. Knox was present at the cottage during the murder, after she stated she wasn ’t at first , and was aware of the sexual aspect of the crime before it was even determined by the Police . Guede raped oraccording to his version he had consensual sex with Kercher , which was evidenced by the semen found in her vagina , which Knox already knew BEFORE the police report. How could knox already know that a black guy sexually assaulted Meredith two days before the autopsy report was released? She already had knowledge she clearly should not have had had she been truly innocent. Either Amanda is a fortune teller or you know the other option.",0

Not entirely implausible. His version isn't inconsistent with the evidence. Guede was a drug dealer too who had been arrested like 10 times and probably had warrants. Drug dealers can't just go call the police to a murder scene like normal people. I believe him, Knox and the ex boyfriend all had something to do with	it.",0

And why did Knox tell the Police that Meredith always locked her bedroom door yet the other roommate Filomena said she NEVER did? How did Knox know that Meredith ‘s ‘’f%cking throat was slit’’ ( in Amanda’s own words) BEFORE the police revealed that information?

They both happened to have had their mobile phones deactivated the night the murder took place. According to two separate DNA tests the DNA found in the victim’s bra clasp was perfect match with Raf ‘s and according to Professor Novelli the amount of Raf ‘s DNA found in the bra clasp was significant.

One has to ignore great pieces of evidence for Amanda and Raf to be innocent, hence they were both twice convicted. Their convictions were absolutely justified given the evidence presented in the trial. When the Police ask you for a timeline and you don ’t tell them the provable truth you immediately become a suspect , especially when you are found on the crime scene after it has been cleaned with bleach you were seen buying the morning after the murder took place and bloody footprints are recovered by the Police with the use of Luminol, which perfectly matched Raf’s. Especially , if there has been a clearly staged burglary and you already knew when you called the Police that nothing had been stolen. Either Raf was a psychic or you know the other option.

Meredith Kercher, 21, was killed by multiple attackers, including Knox's boyfriend Rafaelle Sollecito and small-time drug dealer Rudy Guede, but it was Knox who lashed the deadly wound to the throat, the appellate court in Florence said. The fight with Kercher became increasingly aggressive, the judges said in their 337-page explanation for the January guilty verdicts against the American student and her former boyfriend. The explanation added that the group had gathered to use drugs before the 2007 murder. The judges also concluded that Kercher was stabbed by two different knives, one of which was held by Knox - although it said Sollecito and Guede were equally responsible for the murder. Meredith was immobilized and was unable to put up any useful resistance due to the fact that she was overpowered by a number of aggressors and simultaneously stabbed with the blades, they said. If it confirms the convictions, a long extradition fight for Knox is expected. She has been in the United States since 2011 when her earlier conviction was overturned. NBC News
Amanda Knox was jealous of Meredith Kercher because Meredith reminded her that she could not be the most popular and prettiest girl and because unlike Amanda Meredith took her studies seriously. Meredith stole the attention from Amanda, who is in my opinion a narcissist. It was a crime of passion. Knox is NOT an innocent victim railroaded by an unfair justice system and unfairly maligned by Italian courts and media. Even the acquitting court ruled there were multiple killers involved and that Guede did not act alone. I don ’t believe that Knox’s persecution was in bad faith. Knox presented herself as a victim of anti Americanism degraded by the Italian media but in fact she isn ‘t. She should be thankful she was tried in Italy. In the USA she most likely would have been convicted and her conviction would not have been overturned.",0

2. Was the crime scene partially cleaned up? Who did that? The luminol traces, the bathmat with just one footprint, the absence of footprints in the house, etc. provide hard evidence to justify this claim. Again, AK was the only suspect who had motives to do that.
3. Why did she falsely accuse her boss of committing the murder? AK was interrogated for as long as 1 hour before she accused her boss. Moreover, she provided specific details of the murder unknown to the police at that time.
Americans reading this, keep in mind one thing: The Italian justice system, while being perfectible, is just as good as the american. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. But please, do not get in the position of saying AK was just a foolish girl who was railroaded by a stupid justice system in a crazy country.

732737983133159424,"Nancy grace is a ignorant bitch, how does she still have a time slot on tv?","Overworked. Seriously the amount of music videos and songs they have despite only being a three year old group (as of now) is seriously insane. This may be because they are self produced so the company doesn’t have to do much except be in charge of the photo shoots, music videos, promotions etc. The actual music making part is already done for them. I do know some stays have a dislike towards JYP because of the survival show especially if they watched it as it came out. Minho and felix got eliminated and it emotionally impacted the members and fans so it makes sense. I am not saying JYP didn’t know what he was doing when he removed them from the team. He has been in the industry for a while and i see some stays explaining why they understood his decision. I myself don’t know much and don’t really evaluate them much on stage. However some stays say they understood why so I don’t hate him for it. Yes it did hurt to see and that doesn’t mean I am 100% fine with what he did but what matters is he added them back at the end.",0

732737983133159424,"Nancy grace is a ignorant bitch, how does she still have a time slot on tv?",I already explained overworked but i’ll just say i personally think twice are or atleast were more over worked then straykids at one point in time. Yes I do know about the strict diets they have and won’t go into too much detail so if you want to know more you can search it up on youtube or google. I am pretty sure a lot of you guys now about momo only eating one ice cube a day for a week in order to loose a lot of a weight for a photo shoot. First of all this is just wrong and too extreme momo herself said she was scared that she wouldn’t wake up. All for a photo shoot? really? you would have idols not eat properly for days for a photo shoot?(JYP has body shamed before and i’m sure JYP may have known atleast something about this).The last thing I will say about twice is that when tzuyu was 16 JYP let’s her perform a inappropriate dance for a ad. She was only 16 and the dance wasn’t something any minor should be forced to do for a ad or not. JYP probably saw that ad but he didn’t do anything about it and just let it get uploaded as if she wasn’t a minor when it was filmed.,0

732737983133159424,"Nancy grace is a ignorant bitch, how does she still have a time slot on tv?",I have so much and am aware on missing a lot here and I am just briefing over things. The members say he favors female idols like twice and suzy over them and treats them so kindly. However got7 mainly just get a quite greeting and not really a smile. Jb worked so hard on a song and was so nervous to show it to jyp but he rejected it after listening to it for like 5 seconds. the promotions. oh boy. aghases promote got7 more than jyp does out of all honesty. they are the ones that pay for got7 pictures to be put up. Not jyp. it’s ridiculous considering jyp has the money but doesn’t do anything about it.,0

732737983133159424,"Nancy grace is a ignorant bitch, how does she still have a time slot on tv?",I don’t know too much about this group besides the fact that they are barely even promoted. These idols have so much talent but Jyp is just wasting all of it really. This new band type of group is such a good idea yet jyp doesn’t commit to them at all.,0
732737983133159424,"Nancy grace is a ignorant bitch, how does she still have a time slot on tv?",yes i am aware i didn’t do itzy. there is a number of reasons for that. I am getting tired. I also don’t know too much about them and JYP specifically. yes there is some situations i could write about that i know of and some i am probably am missing. i apologize but i’d rather just write when i’m sure of something rather than elaborate some interaction and take it the wrong way since i am not too familiar with the girls. I may update and add them later if i get the chance and become more aware of their relationship with JYP. Now I will just say some basic information i know about jyp or things other stans have agreed on that i will include before i end this post. JYP is afraid of letting his boy groups become bigger than him. his ego gets in the way which is probably why got7 and day6 aren’t even promoted anymore. Stray kids is their only well promoted boy group right now and i really hope he doesn’t just stop promoting them one day too. It is also obvious JYP favors his female idols over his male idols. I don’t know why but other jyp stans have came up with these observations and possible explanations to his behavior and such.,0

No malicious intent behind this! do not send anyone hate over this. this is just mine and other people’s opinions that i added to try to explain the strong dislike many people have for JYP. have a good day\night!,0

732737983133159424,"Nancy grace is a ignorant bitch, how does she still have a time slot on tv?","People in business are there to make money, so the things they say in public are things that they believe will make money for them. Bill Nye, for example, went from hosting a science show for children to a career as a professional evangelist for the social justice movement, because Bill Nye believes there’s money in it. Why would he go from a children’s science show host to a social justice campaigner? There is no relation between those two things at all, except for the fact that they both happened to be the means by which Mr. Nye could make the most money at the time. Once he achieved basic celebrity status, he knew he had an audience for pretty much anything he said, so he jumped on the biggest trend he could think of for the extra dough. This is not exactly difficult to understand, but a lot of us are naive enough to think that celebrities who suddenly change from educational children’s entertainers to Social Justice Samurai really did experience a sudden change of heart and aren’t just chasing the dough the way the mouse chases the cheese.",0

The entire basis of film is creating a convincing illusion. The entire basis of acting is pretending to feel an emotion in a way that looks real.

732737983133159424,"Nancy grace is a ignorant bitch, how does she still have a time slot on tv?","Before I finished all the episodes of friends, I used to binge watch random scenes of friends on youtube. And I used to think Ross is such a good person yet everything bad only happens to him, and Rachel is a bitch.",0
732737983133159424,"Nancy grace is a ignorant bitch, how does she still have a time slot on tv?","But when I watched all of the episodes properly, here are some of the things I realized.",0
732737983133159424,"Nancy grace is a ignorant bitch, how does she still have a time slot on tv?","1. When Rachel said out of anger that she wants a break, Ross didn’t even wait for a day and got drunk in the pub, ended up sleeping with another woman.
2. Rather than accepting that he made a mistake, he kept defending himself for the rest of the seasons saying “We were on a break”.
3. After they broke up, Ross happily started dating another girl ( That bald girl) whereas Rachel couldn’t move on with that office colleague because she was still in love with Ross.
4. Even Ross fell in love with Emily and started doing all the things a guy would do while being in mad love, and even he got married while Rachel was still in love with him.
5. And when finally after a long time Rachel ‘seriously’ fell for someone (Joey) Ross started behaving like they have done a big injustice with him, just because Rachel carried his baby while he was dating that palaeontologist girl! So he has full right to go on dates and have sex with women happily and Rachel will give birth to his baby, face all the cramps alone? And during this time she can’t even fall for a man(JOEY) who took care of her? How is this a cheating and I don’t understand why was Rachel and Joey giving explanation saying sorry to Ross after they got caught while kissing. Ross was dating someone too.
The only time there has been an injustice with Ross, is the time when Carol left him for Susan. I felt bad for ross only in the 1st season, and I thought he’s the one who has been left alone always and all the bad things happen to him. But as you proceed through the next seasons, you’ll realize Ross is just an annoying man who throws tantrums and thinks bad things only happen to him and all.",0
732737983133159424,"Nancy grace is a ignorant bitch, how does she still have a time slot on tv?","Rachel seemed to me like a bitchy character many times throughout the seasons but beside that, one more thing I noticed is that she was the one who loved hard, more than Ross. Ross moved on in no time but it took Rachel years to actually move on, she couldn’t get over Ross for a long time even after Ross slept with another woman.",0
732737983133159424,"Nancy grace is a ignorant bitch, how does she still have a time slot on tv?","People in general do not like Southern for a variety of reasons. Most of it is politics, weather, history, living quality. Despite the growth that Texas is showing, there are many reasons why Texas is one of the most hated states in the country.",0
732737983133159424,"Nancy grace is a ignorant bitch, how does she still have a time slot on tv?","1. Many people hate that Texas wants to be independent. Yes, Texas was independent, and practically begged to be part of the US. But many Texans are so proud of their state that they want Texas to be independent. To most Americans, that looks like a separatist movement. It’s very true that Texans love their state a lot.
2. Perhaps my biggest turn off about Texas is the weather. Texas is much hotter than California! Texas summer is the equivalent to being drown in a saucepan of boiling water, it’s too hot! While all Southern states are notorious for this, Texas, Louisiana, and Florida are especially notorious for this. Winter season in Texas is barely cold. The only cold part of Texas is probably the Panhandle, but it’s still not very cold at all.
3. Politics in Texas is a lot like other Southern states, but it’s quite more on the extreme side. Texas is VERY conservative. As someone from the Pacific Northwest, I can not comprehend the conservative mindset of Texas. Texans are overly religious, very pro-guns, not very LGBT- friendly. Politicians in Texas don’t really care about the environment at all. It’s one of the most politically backward states in the country. In comparison to states like Washington, Oregon, Colorado, Maine, and Vermont, Texas is the complete opposite of those states. Politics is healthy when it’s not polarized, but Texas is very polarized to the Right wing.
4. While opportunities are plentiful in Texas, jobs in Texas don’t pay nearly as good as in Northern states and Western states. Texas’s minimum wage is still $7.25/ hr, yet cost of living in Texas is still rising every year.
5. Outdoor, or lack thereof. People don’t move to Texas to enjoy the outdoor, they move to Texas for jobs. Dallas, Houston, Austin, and San Antonio are nowhere near any mountains. While Central Texas has beautiful hills, they’re nothing when comparing to what you’ll find out West. West Texas has some amazing sights, but West Texas is very far away from all of Texas’s major cities.
Overall, I think Texas is disliked because of those things above. Most people don’t choose to move to Texas, they just have to move to Texas. Due to high cost of living in the West Coast and Northern states, many companies are moving to Texas to save money. Along with it, many employees have to relocate to Texas as well. Texas is benefiting much from the growth though, but it still need a lot of changes. I personally wouldn’t move to Texas for the weather alone. If I have to choose between Alaska and Texas, I’d rather choose Alaska over Texas any day.",0

I know many people in TV and radio, but he is not one of them. That said, people who have written about him note that he is surprisingly “normal”— in other words, not arrogant, not an egomaniac. Of course, to work in the media (especially to be a comic or host a major TV show), one must have an ego and a certain degree of confidence. But he seems to have found a balance between having enough confidence and having too much — even the gossip columnists don’t portray him as hard to get along with. (This could mean he has a good publicist who carefully controls his image; or it could mean he’s generally a nice guy and most people think so.)",0

I have definitely known celebrities who acted friendly when they were performing, but who acted like they thought they were better than everyone in their personal life. I have also known celebrities (the members of the rock band Rush come to mind) who were just as warm and personable when performing as they were with their friends and families. Since I have spent absolutely no time with Mr. Fallon, all I can say with certainty is that people who work for him, and with him, seem to like him.",0

732737983133159424,"Nancy grace is a ignorant bitch, how does she still have a time slot on tv?","Ok , let me tell you something about Ms Knox. If someone told me i either had to do 5 day jobs and pay the rent by myself or move in with Amanda Knox and split the rent i would 100 times rather the first. Why? Because i want to live. To me it is crystal clear this woman is a sociopath and she certainly was involved in Kercher’s murder , if she did not kill her herself. Amanda Knox was convicted twice. Not once , but twice. Nobody is convicted twice if they are completely innocent. There was evidence against her that clearly incriminated her , hence the convictions. Scott Peterson is on death row right now on much less circumstantial evidence against him than there was against Knox.",0
732737983133159424,"Nancy grace is a ignorant bitch, how does she still have a time slot on tv?","The police found her and Sollecito at the crime scene AFTER it had been cleaned. They clearly staged a break in to make it seem like there was a burglary. The burglar could have taken expensive items but stole NOTHING, instead he raped and murdered a girl and left empty handed. There were zero external traces of a burglar outside the house. And how exactly a 4 kg stone made it to the second floor ? Impossible , based on the natural law of gravity. What was believed to be the murder weapon was found in Sollecito ‘s apartment. The victim ‘s DNA was found on the blade of the knife and Knox’ s DNA was found on the handle, which , the presumed murder weapon , was found in Sollecito’s apartment , where Meredith had never been, and Sollecito clearly lied when he claimed that she pricked her hand with the knife when she had dinner at his house, where she had never been, hence , he LIED to the Police. Knox was seen buying bleach the morning after the murder and the woman who cleaned Sollecito ‘s apartment stated that it smelt like bleach that particular day even though he had particularly told her NOT to ever use bleach to clean his place. Knox and Sollecito changed their story multiple times, they lied about their computer activity, they could not come up with a coherent story , they contradicted one another , they deactivated their mobile phones on the murder night AND they were privy to information only a person who was involved in the murder could have been. How did Sollecito know that nothing was stolen from Filomena’s room even before the Police opened the door? How could Knox already know that Meredith had been sexually assaulted even before the Police report and the autopsy results were released?",0
732737983133159424,"Nancy grace is a ignorant bitch, how does she still have a time slot on tv?","Knox did not have an alibi for the night of the murder after Sollecito stated that they did not spend the entire night together AFTER ALL and threw her under the bus at which point Knox falsely and effortlessly accused a man she knew was innocent. Rafaelle withdrew Amanda ‘s alibi when he said that she was not with him the entire night at which point she scapegoated an innocent man when she fingered Lumumba. She didn ’t recant her malicious and false allegation even when her boss Lumumba , who she knew was innocent, was in prison. Knox did not just accuse Lumumba under duress , she fabricated an elaborate and demonstrably false story about the night of the murder. Amanda cracked under a small amount of pressure. Most people , even under coercion, don’t imagine a vivid scenario, incriminating an innocent man. She had no qualms letting an INNOCENT man rot in prison and had a customer of his not seen by mere chance in a newspaper that Lumumba was suspect for the murder then he might have even been convicted. A Swiss businessman came forward to say he had been talking to Lumumba all night long the night the murder took place. Lumumba had an air tight alibi, Amanda Knox did not. Knox is a convicted criminal felon due to her false accusations against an innocent man. She is a convicted liar. Sollecito could NOT back up her alibi on the night of the murder AND he also refuted her claim that she had a shower the morning she returned home and found the door slightly ajar and blood in the bathroom yet she was not concerned AT ALL , she just assumed the blood was either from her recently pierced ears or her roommate’ period blood, which both claims are ridiculous , and she claimed she showered any way BUT Sollecito said she did not shower after all. If she knowingly lied about Lumumba then what else did she lie about? If she lied about Meredith always locking her door when in fact she didn ’t then what else did she lie about? If she lied about having a shower, when in fact she didn ’t , then what else did she lie about?",0
732737983133159424,"Nancy grace is a ignorant bitch, how does she still have a time slot on tv?","Amanda Knox made statements to the police that involved references to events the investigation ascertained actually happened AFTER she had made those statements , which only a participant in those events could have known about BUT she already knew firstly that Meredith had screamed loudly and that she had been sexually assaulted. How could she have already known at the time? Rudy Guede , who was convicted of Kercher’s murder and sentenced to 16 years , pointed the finger at Knox and it was established in court that he did not act alone. Kercher had minimum defensive wounds which proves there were more than one attacker. The forensics made it clear he could not have acted alone and had at least 2 other people holding Kercher’ s arms out the way. She was stabbed and bruised over 50 times, she had less than 3 defensive wounds. Normally half of the wounds or more are defensive as the person is trying to block the knife or pull away or move around, people don't just let you stab them 20 times and not raise their hands unless they are being restrained. The 3 defensive wounds are consistent with when her hand slipped away from someone who was supposed to be holding it. Knox was present at the cottage during the murder, after she stated she wasn ’t at first , and was aware of the sexual aspect of the crime before it was even determined by the Police . Guede raped oraccording to his version he had consensual sex with Kercher , which was evidenced by the semen found in her vagina , which Knox already knew BEFORE the police report. How could knox already know that a black guy sexually assaulted Meredith two days before the autopsy report was released? She already had knowledge she clearly should not have had had she been truly innocent. Either Amanda is a fortune teller or you know the other option.",0

Not entirely implausible. His version isn't inconsistent with the evidence. Guede was a drug dealer too who had been arrested like 10 times and probably had warrants.

Meredith Kercher, 21, was killed by multiple attackers, including Knox's boyfriend Rafaelle Sollecito and small-time drug dealer Rudy Guede, but it was Knox who lashed the deadly wound to the throat, the appellate court in Florence said. The fight with Kercher became increasingly aggressive, the judges said in their 337-page explanation for the January guilty verdicts against the American student and her former boyfriend. The explanation added that the group had gathered to use drugs before the 2007 murder. The judges also concluded that Kercher was stabbed by two different knives, one of which was held by Knox - although it said Sollecito and Guede were equally responsible for the murder. Meredith was immobilized and was unable to put up any useful resistance due to the fact that she was overpowered by a number of aggressors and simultaneously stabbed with the blades, they said. If it confirms the convictions, a long extradition fight for Knox is expected. She has been in the United States since 2011 when her earlier conviction was overturned. NBC News
Amanda Knox was jealous of Meredith Kercher because Meredith reminded her that she could not be the most popular and prettiest girl and because unlike Amanda Meredith took her studies seriously. Meredith stole the attention from Amanda, who is in my opinion a narcissist. It was a crime of passion. Knox is NOT an innocent victim railroaded by an unfair justice system and unfairly maligned by Italian courts and media. Even the acquitting court ruled there were multiple killers involved and that Guede did not act alone. I don ’t believe that Knox’s persecution was in bad faith. Knox presented herself as a victim of anti Americanism degraded by the Italian media but in fact she isn ‘t. She should be thankful she was tried in Italy. In the USA she most likely would have been convicted and her conviction would not have been overturned.",0

2. The break in was clearly staged and she is the only one that could have done it. Look it this way: Rudy breaks in violently and then after committing the murder covers her body and closes the door? Not plausible.
3. Some parts of the house were definitely cleaned after the murder. She is the only one that could have done it.
4. Her behavior after the murder was discovered was strange at its best. The first people that became suspicious were not the police but the other roommates.
5. She falsely accused somebody and placed herself in the murder scene after a short interrogation. (Roughly 1 hour)
She could not have done it but probably brought Rudy to the house. Something happened and he murdered Meredith. Rudy escaped. She panicked and tried to make the murder seem as a robbery gone wrong.",0
732737983133159424,"Nancy grace is a ignorant bitch, how does she still have a time slot on tv?",I think she was innocent.,0
732737983133159424,"Nancy grace is a ignorant bitch, how does she still have a time slot on tv?","There was not a single piece her DNA found in the room where Meredith Kercher was brutally murdered. It is almost impossible to commit a brutal murder like that without leaving a DNA trace unless she was wearing protective clothing. We shed DNA constantly as we sit or walk around. There were 8 or more DNA traces from Rudy Guede in the room (who I think is definitely guilty). The one bit of DNA from Amanda’s boyfriend which was found on a bra strap in the room was found 50 odd days after the murder! Not only that but it was found along with two other unidentified male’s DNA on the same bra clasp! It was then shown that the crime scene was turned in to a farce from day one, where investigators and police came in and out the room without any protective clothing, tracing through the whole flat without changing gloves or even wearing protective suits. The ease at which DNA is left from a person walking around or moved around a flat in such a disorganised mess is well documented. This means the one piece of DNA from Sollecito (Amanda’s bf) means nothing since he had previously been in the flat so Meredith’s room easily could have been contaminated with his DNA after FIFTY+ days of investigators trailing in and out. The DNA of Meredith found on a knife in Sollecitos flat was found to be a false negligible signal by an independent lab who found out the original lab processed multiple samples of Meredith’s belongings at the same time as the knife. A ridiculous farce! I work in a lab and I know how easy it is for contamination to occur between samples when running them at the same time. The fact that the signal was negligible basically means it amounts to squat. Finally and importantly if you have not yet please watch the Netflix documentary on the case. The Italian investigator/prosecutor, Giuliano Mignini, who runs the case in the local town is a complete and utter joke! Giuliano Mignini is a disgrace to his profession. He talks about how he is a fan of Sherlock Holmes and boasts about the attention and respect he got from locals for dealing with the case. He arrives at wild and odd conclusions based on either random occurrences or utter bullshit. He actually says “A woman committed the murder because Meredith was covered with her blanket when we found her, a man would never think to do this!” That was the birth of the crazy leaps in logic he takes from insignificant events. He caused all the problems for Amanda and spurred all the mistreatment in this case. The way he hounded her after she just found out her housemate was murdered. They lied to her and told her she tested positive for HIV when she hadn’t!!! WHAT THE HELL!? They broke her down until they could force her to agree to statements they put in front of her. Amanda is a bit odd, perhaps she has aspergers or just an individual personality, this doesn’t make her a murderer. At very most (although I doubt it) she knows a little more than she’s letting on about what happened but I don’t think she was involved in the murder. The whole farce in the case was caused by one man - the incompetence of Giuliano Mignini! I looked him up and he’s been involved in similar cases where he’s come out with wild theories that have stretched out cases and his fantasies have then later been disproven. The papers also manipulated events to paint the picture of a monster which, by certain journalist’s own admissions, was to make a better story. A video clip of around 10 seconds including the still frame used in the papers of her kissing her boyfriend at the crime scene after she had called police, tells a different story when watching the 10 second video clip. She looks upset and worried the exact emotions you’d expect in the situation, she then turns to her bf and gives him A PECK on the lips (still frame used by papers) and then turns away with a sad expression. If you want to judge their characters rather than the evidence I don’t think I’ve ever seen a sweeter acting guy than Sollecito. If you want to judge the evidence, like I suggest, Amanda couldn’t of committed the brutal murder without leaving her DNA all over that room. Guiliano Mignini should be fired immediately.",0

603929089645355008,@BAAssociation FUCK YOU BASTARD!

603929089645355008,@BAAssociation FUCK YOU BASTARD! BRITNEY SPEARS IS UGLY AND FAT!,"According to reports about her life, comments from her and her ex-husband, it seems to have been a number of things, including:",0
603929089645355008,@BAAssociation FUCK YOU BASTARD! BRITNEY SPEARS IS UGLY AND FAT!,"1. Existing mental health issues - Ms. Spears has apparently been suffering from a number of mental issues since her teens and, until the last decade or so, they had been untreated or poorly treated.
2. Substance abuse - Spears apparently was addicted to a number of substances and has gone to rehab on multiple occasions to wean herself off of those substances.
3. Post-partum depression - After having her children, Spears seems to have suffered from depression. This may have been aggravated by her substance issues, her mental health issues and her crumbling marriage.
4. Her relationships - Spears has never been involved in a stable romantic relationship since she became an adult. The turmoil of this, coupled with her other problems, seems to have taken its toll upon her psyche.
5. Her career - Until Britney Spears gained her “residence” (A long-term performance contract) in Las Vegas, her career was spiraling out of control. The pressures of changing from a teen idol into a mature performer seems to have caused her a number of issues which also seem to have also taken its toll on her personal life.
Despite being 37 years old, Spears is still under a court-mandated guardianship. That means that her father and her attorneys make the majority of her financial and medical decisions for her as she has been deemed unfit to do so herself. If or when this will be lifted seems to be unknown, although Spears’ camp claims that she is “improving.”",0

She admitted in a May 18 Instagram post that she was super insecure about not being able to pull off wearing her hair without bangs, and said her teeth made her feel like an “ugly duckling.” Brit even claimed a modeling agency said she “wasn’t pretty enough” to work for them during her grade-school years.",0

There was a time when Spears was one of the hottest pop stars in the music scene, with best-selling albums and hit singles that spawned some of the sexiest music videos of her era. Yet, things weren’t always bright and sunny for Spears as she faced struggles in her personal life. Many have blamed her problems on the fact that she achieved such a large amount of fame at an early age. People have speculated that this is the main reason why she couldn’t seem to cope with all of the stress that fame brought.

Yet, Britney Spears has been known to do just that on more than one occasion. In this particular photo, Spears can be seen chowing down on Taco Bell and it’s not a pretty sight. At one point, the photo shows her slurping up some loose cheese that is desperately trying to get away.

Yet, all of that was demolished during her 2007 performance at the VMAs. She appeared in fishnet stockings and a rhinestone bra and panty set with black detailing. While this would have been completely appropriate for Spears during her heyday, she no longer had the same physique and it wasn’t a flattering look to have so much skin revealed. Rolls of fat could be seen whenever she moved and the bottoms cut into her sides to give her a pronounced muffin top.

When fans buy Britney Spears' concert tickets, there is a certain standard they have in their minds regarding what the performance should look like. In 2011, Spears was performing in London and was highly criticized for her appearance during the show. She wore a pair of ripped denim shorts with pink rhinestone accents that matched the rhinestone-studded bra. While the ensemble was bad enough with a dated look and unflattering style, it was her overweight form that really stole the show.

While her sweat suit-style ensemble was bad enough and the bald head definitely put it over the top, the fact that she could go into a full-on meltdown made her look even uglier. To be fair, this moment in February of 2007 was an extremely difficult time for Spears since she was in the middle of a bitter custody battle with Kevin Federline.

Britney Spears must have missed the memo and she decided to walk the shopping area wearing gigantic oversized sweatpants and a tank top with a “Rehab” motif. It’s obvious that she’s not wearing a bra beneath her ill-fitting white top and from the dangerously low cut of her pants, she may not be wearing underwear either. Her hair is pulled back in a sloppy ponytail and she doesn’t seem at all embarrassed by the fact that she looks like a hobo in the pictures.

However, it could also just be that she hadn’t run a comb through it in quite some time. Whatever the case, fans would have been much more satisfied to see her in a hat rather than reveal the bird’s nest on her head. Yet, the worst part of her look was the facial expressions she used while walking. While the world doesn’t expect her to have a plastered smile on her face the entire time, some of the expressions she chose to don were very unflattering. Perhaps she was wearing a scantily clad ensemble to try and bring the attention away from her face and hair but that was almost impossible.",0

Yet, that wasn’t the only reason why fans aren’t too big on the Kevin Federline phase of Britney Spears.

This is especially true since designers often send new products to celebrities to try and get them to be photographed with it and thus helping with product sales. Yet, not all celebrities can pull off certain style trends and not all of them know how to put together a correct ensemble on occasions. This photo is a prime example of that since Britney Spears chose to throw as many trends into one outfit as possible. While the Bohemian chic style can be extremely flattering, this frilly white dress isn’t exactly giving off that vibe. Instead, it’s extremely ill-fitting and could stand to be jazzed up a bit. Rather than keep her hair flowing and flirty to go along with the dress, she tucked it into a hat with a bold purple ribbon to make it stand out even further. The pièce de résistance are the Uggs that bring down the entire look. While she may have been trying to look like a trendsetter in her style, she wound up looking more like a hot mess.",0

While shopping in Los Angeles, Spears had her picture taken while looking ultra pale. Although it was taken on a sunny day, Spears looks downright pasty in her skin tone and it doesn’t help that she’s wearing a white and khaki ensemble. It only washes her out even further and the cut of the top is completely unflattering. The strapless style makes her breasts look saggy and her upper body flabby.

Yet, the photos showing her actually getting her head shaved can sometimes be forgotten. At one point, Spears can be seen taking the razor in her own hands and shaving off her hair to a completely bald state. There were a few different theories regarding her reason for wanting to shave her head so it’s up to the public to decide for themselves. One excuse was that the years of extensions and hair clips had destroyed her hair and she wanted to start off fresh with a completely even cut to ensure healthier hair. Another reason that floated around was that she was trying to get rid of any drug evidence that might come up during the custody battle she was facing at the time. Fearing that her hair would be tested for drug use, it was alleged that she shaved her head to get around the drug testing. Others believe that she shaved her head because she was going through a mental breakdown and wasn’t thinking clearly. Whatever the reason, the photos of her taking a razor to her own head with a maniacal smile on her face were nightmare-worthy.",0

However, this photo has taken her driving habits to a whole new level. While the public may want to believe that this nose-picking photo is just an isolated incident, there were actually court documents that referenced Britney’s alleged regular nose-picking habits.

While there were some episodes where Spears looked pretty healthy and almost back to her former beautiful state, there were many other times where she appeared nothing like a pop star. In this particular photo, Spears looked incredibly old and rundown. Her complexion appeared orange-like in its tone, her dark roots made her hairline appear strange and her lips seem practically non-existent.

In this particular photo, her dark hair had a bit of an auburn tone but it wasn’t very flattering against her skin tone. To make things even worse, she had a ranch-like ensemble that made her look like a spare farmhand rather than a pop star. The denim shorts were ill-fitting and had a fringe cut on the bottom that made them look like something cheaply purchased at Walmart.

In this particular photo, Spears is obviously having a bad day and she’s not exactly looking her best. To be fair, the paparazzi constantly hound celebrities and often provoke them to try and get a picture out of them that will garner the best results for the purpose of selling tabloids. It’s obvious that she was being hounded by someone since she can be seen sticking her tongue out in one photo and bawling crying in another.

Her first cd is in this lower, twangier voice-with spurts of the nasally, baby sound here and there when she would remember to sing higher. She was never a Mariah Carey by far, but she could hold her own. Her “Silent Night” is a good example. That lower voice was just not going to fit her image, so they, for lack of a better term, forced her to change her ranged to that high, nasally range. And although it will be argued that her “new” singing voice is awful, it must be some type of success in the singing department-I mean, it’s made her millions. Not only did she choose to go with a weaker range, but it was accepted as an iconic sound.

Unfortunately-in my personal opinion, so no one get uppity-but Britney doesn’t do much singing anymore. You can catch her real voice in parts on cds and in the playback she re-recorded with her “live” voice. One of her last performances live that really impressed me was when she covered “You oughta Know”-ironically the only song she sang live wasn’t even hers. But you could feel her hatred for Kevin. You know that bitch heard that song randomly and listened to the words and was like “Oh Shit Ya’ll! This song is MY SONG TO KEVIN!!

The industry has made her signature breathy voice a trademark, however, that she, reluctantly or not, stuck with it throughout her career - it caused her voice to diminish with time because continuous and prolonged singing in such breathy fashion without long rests can really irritate the vocal folds and cause you to eventually lose control over their function (not to mention the decline was also triggered more quickly by smoking and drugs). Had she stuck with the natural way she sang, she might still be able to sing well today, but such choice would not have made her a superstar and grant her the respected pop icon status that she is enjoying, because it would not make her necessarily stand out compared to her contemporaries.",0

Her voice became (or she had to make her voice) breathless and raspy. at the time, her speaking voice and her singing voice were on different levels-her speaking voice was kinda deep and southern-y. Meanwhile her singing voice was like a baby crying for help, kind of breathless. Not insulting her. Ig her management or herself's decision was to sing in a breathless voice. Then, her voice changed from deep to very squeaky. Not a bad kinda squeaky, she started to sound like a little girl. Iam younger than her but i have a deeper voice. Her singing voice affected her actual one.",0
603929089645355008,@BAAssociation FUCK YOU BASTARD! BRITNEY SPEARS IS UGLY AND FAT!,"SO THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION YOU ASKED IS-kind of. She can sing good but not great. Her music is good but not the singing. Some singers' songs are good and liked by many and that can be because of the music production, not their voice quality. Same thing with her. But she can sing, but not the best. Her career was really pushed into an adultish career when she just started. She was sexualized a lot. Ig that was because of her costumes and her voice. Also her magazine issues when she wasn't even an adult. I heard people telling that she was pushed into this world of music as a teen pop singer (young singer) with a breathless voice and a lolita type image. I kinda agree with that. She shouldn't have sung with that baby voice no matter how many good songs she have. She should have tried singing with her actual voice. Its better than the other voice.",0

 * brit later signed to jive records she audioned by singing Whitney housten’s I will always love you her dream was to become a young comtemparary artist
 * however with the rise of bands like the spice girls and the backstreet boys and with them learning that she cauld dance her management decided to bring back teen pop
 * Since brit’s beautifull and deep voice won’t be suitable for her music her management decided to teach her to sing in the iconic “baby voice”
 * it worked brit became a huge teen sensation the BIGGEST teen pop star of all time brit ruled the 20s alright she did
 * anyway in her first couple 2 ears brit was able to give as good voclas however with her using the baby voice plenty of times it took a toll on her
 * this is way she lips
 * however she can still sing her voice is just damaged that’s it",0

603929089645355008,@BAAssociation FUCK YOU BASTARD! BRITNEY SPEARS IS UGLY AND FAT!,"So yeah, she actually can. Why she opts to lip sync, I'm not sure. And I'm not saying this as a britney fan, I'm saying it as a singer of over 20 years that has had education and knows what she's listening to. She lip syncs a lot, mostly due to the fact that she's almost 40 and dances a lot, I'm sure. But occasionally, Britney will decide to bust out a live one. Some people described her actual live cover of something to talk about as a poor performance, and I'm not sure why. Maybe they're just dead set on believing she can't sing, maybe they don't understand how difficult it is for someone with a lower vocal range and softer voice to project across a crowd of thousands, maybe its just not their taste. But the cover of her singing something to talk about in 2017 at her las Vegas residency was really pretty damn good. I found it very impressive, especially for being a shitty quality cell phone recording from inside the crowd. Its all mostly opinion on what you consider a voice you like to listen to, but she certainly can still sing when she wants to.",0

603929089645355008,@BAAssociation FUCK YOU BASTARD! BRITNEY SPEARS IS UGLY AND FAT!,"OK. Here’s the thing with ol’ Brit Brit. Homegirl could actually really sing at first. Her first cd is in this lower, twangier voice-with spurts of the nasally, baby sound here and there when she would remember to sing higher. She was never a Mariah Carey by far, but she could hold her own. Her “Silent Night” is a good example. That lower voice was just not going to fit her image, so they, for lack of a better term, forced her to change her ranged to that high, nasally range. And although it will be argued that her “new” singing voice is awful, it must be some type of success in the singing department-I mean, it’s made her millions. Not only did she choose to go with a weaker range, but it was accepted as an iconic sound. On any song, as soon as you hear that little robo-sex moan, you know who the fuck it is-and you can’t really argue with success.",0
603929089645355008,@BAAssociation FUCK YOU BASTARD! BRITNEY SPEARS IS UGLY AND FAT!,"She still has her moments where you can catch her real singing voice. In a lot of her background vocals she is going the fuck off. Once again, not on Whitneys level-but amazing for Britney. Unfortunately-in my personal opinion, so no one get uppity-but Britney doesn’t do much singing anymore. You can catch her real voice in parts on cds and in the playback she re-recorded with her “live” voice. One of her last performances live that really impressed me was when she covered “You oughta Know”-ironically the only song she sang live wasn’t even hers. But you could feel her hatred for Kevin. You know that bitch heard that song randomly and listened to the words and was like “Oh Shit Ya’ll! This song is MY SONG TO KEVIN!! Larry-I’m gonna need a microphone with working batteries tonight, cus I’m gonna sing live.”",0

It was about her-the whole package-the package that wouldn’t have been complete without changing her voice. And honestly, I would be kinda pissed if I went to her show and she was singing live! Like, wtf Brit. I would personally go on stage and turn her mic off and start the cd. If I have to choose something to sacrifice so that she can twirl, toss and twitch around stage PLEASE, MAKE IT BE THE SINGING LIVE PART.

603929089645355008,@BAAssociation FUCK YOU BASTARD! BRITNEY SPEARS IS UGLY AND FAT!,"According to reports about her life, comments from her and her ex-husband, it seems to have been a number of things, including:",0
603929089645355008,@BAAssociation FUCK YOU BASTARD! BRITNEY SPEARS IS UGLY AND FAT!,"1. Existing mental health issues - Ms. Spears has apparently been suffering from a number of mental issues since her teens and, until the last decade or so, they had been untreated or poorly treated.
2. Substance abuse - Spears apparently was addicted to a number of substances and has gone to rehab on multiple occasions to wean herself off of those substances.
3. Post-partum depression - After having her children, Spears seems to have suffered from depression. This may have been aggravated by her substance issues, her mental health issues and her crumbling marriage.
4. Her relationships - Spears has never been involved in a stable romantic relationship since she became an adult. The turmoil of this, coupled with her other problems, seems to have taken its toll upon her psyche.
5. Her career - Until Britney Spears gained her “residence” (A long-term performance contract) in Las Vegas, her career was spiraling out of control. The pressures of changing from a teen idol into a mature performer seems to have caused her a number of issues which also seem to have also taken its toll on her personal life.
Despite being 37 years old, Spears is still under a court-mandated guardianship. That means that her father and her attorneys make the majority of her financial and medical decisions for her as she has been deemed unfit to do so herself. If or when this will be lifted seems to be unknown, although Spears’ camp claims that she is “improving.”",0

And I don’t really think that she strives to make it the same. Right now in particular, her dancing-for new Britney-is at it’s best. She’s really brought it back in the past year in all departments-killing it. I think she is still having fun performing, or finds parts that she enjoys-but the soul is out of her dancing. It’s not that she’s not giving it her all, she’s just not lost in the movement like she used to be. Every now and again, when she’s performing, she’ll hit a move or two and in that second you’ll see “old” Britney, but then she’s gone. Anyone who has seen both knows what I’m talking about, even people who weren’t fans growing up-everyone knew Britney was going to kill it. That’s the difference now too. It used to be a question of HOW HARD IS SHE going to kill it when you knew she was performing at something. Now you just hope that she remembers to have fun, spit her gum out before she goes on, and doesn’t look bored. (lemmmme stop, that’s my girl, but you know)",0

He had a fling with her while Britney was dating Justin Timberlake, with whom Wade was supposedly friends , thus he was fired. Robson, who came to the USA from Australia in 1991 to pursue a career in Hollywood and worked as a dance teacher since he was 12 , choreographed for pop stars like Spears and N’sync in his early youth . He peaked too early however, he burned out . By the time he was 28 he was already a has been. Robson is the reason Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake broke up. Timberlake’s song Cry me a River was inspired from Britney’s betrayal to Justin, hence there is a Britney look alike in the music video. At the time Wade Robson dated Jackie Jackson’s daughter , Michael’s niece , Brandi, and he non stop cheated on her , thus she dumped him. Contrary to what he claims now, that Michael Jackson allegedly taught him to hate women, it was in fact MJ who set them up because Wade had a crush on her when they were both pre teens. They went out for 7 years , in fact , Brandi Jackson lost her virginity to Robson, who also dated Prince’s ex wife Mayte Garcia before he was even legal. Mayte Garcia attended Robson’s 18 th birthday party wearing a necklace with his name on it. Clearly they were intimate before he was 18 . Robson is a notorious womanizer and always has been ONLY into women. He most likely stopped fooling around when he decided to settle down with his wife Amanda , who looks like an illegal migrant , and who threatened to take their son and divorce him if he didn’t get back to work AFTER he suffered a mental breakdown under the pressure of directing the Step Up Movie in 2010, a project he eventually dropped out of . He was prescribed anti depressant , psychiatric medication then which he no doubt needed , but refused to take even though madness runs in his family . Meanwhile his relationship with Spears and other celebrities fizzled and Spears fired both Robson and his wife Amanda from her Cirque Tour and replaced Robson with Jamie King , whom the MJ Estate also chose for the MJ ONE director job, which Robson begged John Branca to give him. That was a huge blow on his big ego. Britney was smart and got rid of him when he tried to leech on her as he has been doing to the MJ Estate since 2013. Branca said in his deposition that ‘’ i needn’t email Robson and inform him we are hiring Jamie King for the job , i needn’t embarrass Wade and tell him he was not good enough for the job’’. By then , Robson was already in financial trouble, hence he sold all his MJ memorabilia in 2011 ( which he is supposedly seen burning in Leaving Neverland , they are all fake ) as he clearly needed the money.",0

Robson begged Michael Jackson to allow him to have his wedding in Neverland even though he was allegedly sexually abused there FOR YEARS, either since the age of 7 or 11 , depending on which version of his ever - changing story he remembers each time. Then again he also claims he has ‘’evolving’’ memories. Unsurprisingly , none of this is included in the ‘’documentary’’. It didn’t fit his timeline and his agenda.",0

603929089645355008,@BAAssociation FUCK YOU BASTARD! BRITNEY SPEARS IS UGLY AND FAT!,"OK. Here’s the thing with ol’ Brit Brit. Homegirl could actually really sing at first. Her first cd is in this lower, twangier voice-with spurts of the nasally, baby sound here and there when she would remember to sing higher. She was never a Mariah Carey by far, but she could hold her own. Her “Silent Night” is a good example. That lower voice was just not going to fit her image, so they, for lack of a better term, forced her to change her ranged to that high, nasally range. And although it will be argued that her “new” singing voice is awful, it must be some type of success in the singing department-I mean, it’s made her millions. Not only did she choose to go with a weaker range, but it was accepted as an iconic sound. On any song, as soon as you hear that little robo-sex moan, you know who the fuck it is-and you can’t really argue with success.",0
603929089645355008,@BAAssociation FUCK YOU BASTARD! BRITNEY SPEARS IS UGLY AND FAT!,"She still has her moments where you can catch her real singing voice. In a lot of her background vocals she is going the fuck off. Once again, not on Whitneys level-but amazing for Britney. Unfortunately-in my personal opinion, so no one get uppity-but Britney doesn’t do much singing anymore. You can catch her real voice in parts on cds and in the playback she re-recorded with her “live” voice. One of her last performances live that really impressed me was when she covered “You oughta Know”-ironically the only song she sang live wasn’t even hers. But you could feel her hatred for Kevin. You know that bitch heard that song randomly and listened to the words and was like “Oh Shit Ya’ll! This song is MY SONG TO KEVIN!! Larry-I’m gonna need a microphone with working batteries tonight, cus I’m gonna sing live.”",0

It was about her-the whole package-the package that wouldn’t have been complete without changing her voice. And honestly, I would be kinda pissed if I went to her show and she was singing live! Like, wtf Brit. I would personally go on stage and turn her mic off and start the cd. If I have to choose something to sacrifice so that she can twirl, toss and twitch around stage PLEASE, MAKE IT BE THE SINGING LIVE PART.

There hasn’t really been any honest desire to grapple with these details in pop culture.",0
571703319183302656,Avril lavigne is ugly she have no telant,The part even make-up plays is vastly bigger than most people think. Makeup can create many profound illusions; altering the apparent shape and disposition of someone’s face and features more or less at will. Moreover you can do all of this working with neutral and natural colours to create these illusions in a way that don’t appear to be the result of make-up.,0
571703319183302656,Avril lavigne is ugly she have no telant,"%3E Neither of these images is using less makeup. It’s just that the makeup in the right example is not readily obvious because it’s carefully colour matched and intended to look natural.
Hell even something as simple as the shape, colour and thickness of a person’s eyebrows is an entire crazy sub-discipline within the beauty field, and there’s a reason why the people at the top of the industry, the rock-stars of brow-grooming with their A-list clients make small fortunes doing nothing else. The effect that shaping and tinting brows can have on someone’s eyes, even their face overall, is tremendous. In fact it can be hard to really nail down just how profound a difference your brows do make unless you’ve been brow-blocked.",0
571703319183302656,Avril lavigne is ugly she have no telant,So let’s do that to a random celebrity just for the fun of it:,0
571703319183302656,Avril lavigne is ugly she have no telant,Never underestimate the power of good brows. Most women already know this of course. Though if you’re still in doubt let’s simply change her brow shape to something less flattering:,0
571703319183302656,Avril lavigne is ugly she have no telant,"Now I’m being nice here and this new shape is still using the three line rule, it’s tidy, and not some scruffy unibrow, a drag-queen pencil-arch or something else deliberately awful. Hell, I’ve seen women pay to have their brows shaped, and come away looking worse, but the shape, while fine on its own simply isn’t suited to her face, and look what an enormous difference it makes.",0
571703319183302656,Avril lavigne is ugly she have no telant,Then you have the effect played by lighting. For example:,0
571703319183302656,Avril lavigne is ugly she have no telant,"Bad lighting in the first image. The second is probably using reflected and diffused sunlight. As you can see the difference is profound. The framing of a shot can also have a huge influence on how good it’s subject looks, with simple, perspective-based tricks able to create dramatic illusions. Like in the following picture, making the subjects legs look unnaturally long. By comparing how enormous her feet are next to her head or hand we can determine the radical difference between these two points in the image’s depth of field and get an understanding of just how silly and unrealistic it looks, but a casual viewer is not going to be focusing on such details.",0
571703319183302656,Avril lavigne is ugly she have no telant,"As for the transformative effect of good makeup, framing and lighting, all together? The results can be hard to believe. But let’s focus on some individual features, and how much they can be altered using make-up. Here’s an example of how radically overlining can transform someone’s lips:",0
571703319183302656,Avril lavigne is ugly she have no telant,"The following image roughly shows the natural lip-line and how much it’s been altered, and bear in mind this is only easily spotted because the artist did a poor job.",0
571703319183302656,Avril lavigne is ugly she have no telant,"With better technique, lighting, colour-matching and a little photoshopping even a trained eye will have trouble picking out the natural line:",0
571703319183302656,Avril lavigne is ugly she have no telant,"In this image suddenly the same woman whose upper lip is in reality quite thin is now just as full as her lower lip, both have been enlarged and re-shaped, and the result is extremely convincing.",0
571703319183302656,Avril lavigne is ugly she have no telant,Likewise makeup can completely transform the appearance of someone’s eyes.,0
571703319183302656,Avril lavigne is ugly she have no telant,"This woman’s eyes have been re-shaped, and seem not only bigger and to have a more dramatic canthal tilt but would look far more symmetrical in shape and size to the average viewer though in reality they are clearly anything but.",0
571703319183302656,Avril lavigne is ugly she have no telant,"Hell in some cases what makes a good canvas for makeup on camera, what makes you fit to be one of the ‘beautiful people,’ is in fact the opposite of what looks good in reality. For example on a ‘perfect,’ face your eyes would be separated by one eye width of distance, and large eyes are are almost universally considered attractive, yet tiny, extremely wide-set eyes are considered a huge asset to commercial models as they make for an amazing canvas.",0
571703319183302656,Avril lavigne is ugly she have no telant,"%3E Note, I couldn’t find clean Polaroid of this particular model so take the first image with a grain of salt.
And I’ve yet to even mention hair. The style of which can have absolutely dramatic influence on a person’s apparent face-shape, hide many flaws, and even the colour can have a huge impact with lighter hair highlighting the face and darker hair shading it. If you have the money you can even have your hairline itself completely re-shaped to help alter your face shape, remove things like a widows peak, or to even make your forehead higher in order to give your face better lateral symmetry.",0
571703319183302656,Avril lavigne is ugly she have no telant,"Here are two highly staged studio shots of the same women from the last image with a similar, ‘minimalist,’ style of makeup, taken from roughly the same angle. The biggest difference is her hair colour and style.",0
571703319183302656,Avril lavigne is ugly she have no telant,"With her hair swept back her forehead looks larger, her eyes and lips look smaller, and the dark colour does her no favours as she doesn’t have an especially strong bone structure, while in the opposing image her small, wide-set eyes are not even noticeable, her lips seem much larger, and the blonde hair helps to highlight her face. Note how much more vivid her eye colour seems. This isn’t just the highlighting effect either. You might imagine darker hair should contrast better with lighter eye colours, but that hair colour is a tint of yellow which contrasts strongly with blue. Though of course it’s the hair over the face that makes the most dramatic difference. This is such a simple trick. The human brain has what you might call, ‘face recognition software,’ and is amazing at filling in blanks and extrapolating about what we can’t see based on what we can. It’s why when artists draw hair they do not have to draw every individual strand to make it look convincing. In this case because everything we can see is nice when our brain fills in the blanks it assumes everything we can’t see must be equally nice due to a halo-effect like bias.",0
571703319183302656,Avril lavigne is ugly she have no telant,"Now hair is not my speciality but I still know enough to know that this example is barely scratching the surface of the astonishing ways a good hairstyle, or - as in this case - what you might call hair ‘arrangement,’ (which need not reflect any sort of tenable day-to-day style) can transform someone’s face.",0
571703319183302656,Avril lavigne is ugly she have no telant,"There are so many examples of how you can create illusions by way of what people can’t see, and the entire concept of posing is largely about creating these illusions when it comes to body-shape.",0
571703319183302656,Avril lavigne is ugly she have no telant,"Then as we, er, touched on earlier you have digital retouching. The processing of commercial images after they’ve been photographed is in no way a new thing as the term airbrushing makes clear. Traditionally images were in fact doctored by artists using airbrushes and even retouched by hand with paintbrushes before being copied. So if you’ve ever wondered why so many classic pin-ups look weirdly like illustrations it’s because they damn near were.",0
571703319183302656,Avril lavigne is ugly she have no telant,"The tools have only gotten more powerful over time, and they’re used in so many ways the average person wouldn’t even think to factor in. For example if you want a woman’s breasts to seem super perky in an unsupported bandeau top, well:",0
571703319183302656,Avril lavigne is ugly she have no telant,"Just edit out the straps holding them up, of course! You almost have to admire the sheer simplicity of some of these tricks. Though the mendacity of selling a strapless top with a doctored image of a top that actually has straps is another matter, and how it can’t be considered false advertising is beyond me.",0
571703319183302656,Avril lavigne is ugly she have no telant,"Now another comparison, and remember when you see these two images side-by-side that the first is of a woman whose sole job requirement is to look as good as possible, who has more time and money to invest in her appearance than the average person can even fathom, and who is already benefiting from every physical contrivance I’ve already mentioned; full makeup, flattering angles, diffused, reflected lighting, and a host of other cosmetic enhancements I won’t even try to cover. Yet all this is apparently still not good enough.",0
571703319183302656,Avril lavigne is ugly she have no telant,"Now some of this can be done with physical makeup too like the cleavage contouring. That’s it’s own crazy sub-discipline, and is often done terribly as in a later image I’ll show you, but you can’t use makeup to remove creases, shrink someone’s waist, enlarge their breasts, remove the furrows between their brows (why is that a bad thing?!) make a swimsuit look like it was painted on, straighten someone’s crotch (why on earth was this deemed necessary?!) make that little bit of skin bulging over the top of a tight swimsuit smaller, and give people that all-over glow that makes them look like a comic book illustration. You also can’t erase nipples (because think of the children!) whether as a result of tight clothes, or simply so that images which would otherwise be deemed pornographic (at least outside Europe, as they’re not allergic to nipples there) can be put on billboards and the like, and so much else besides.",0
571703319183302656,Avril lavigne is ugly she have no telant,"There is also body contouring with makeup, spray tanning and digital artists working to shade and highlight people’s bodies. I mean, do you not notice how people look super toned and fit in some photos (to say nothing of tattoos disappearing and reappearing) but then their abs disappear and they look soft and exiguous in others?",0
571703319183302656,Avril lavigne is ugly she have no telant,"Incidentally if you’re wondering how they get that magical glow without actually looking sweaty and flushed it’s a mixture of glycerol and water sprayed out of a bottle. Simple, but effective. Also, remember what I said about bad cleavage contouring earlier?",0
571703319183302656,Avril lavigne is ugly she have no telant,Yeah. There is no conceivable universe in which the contouring around her breasts would resemble natural shadows. The thing is people are so used to seeing contouring and generally unaware of its purpose that even the worst of it is effectively invisible to the average consumer.,0
571703319183302656,Avril lavigne is ugly she have no telant,"And all this is just a glimpse, a small glimpse, of the amount of effort, money, and contrivance that goes into making people who can afford it, or who are being used to sell you something look as ‘good,’ (quotation marks because I personally find a lot of the CGI fakery creepy myself) as possible. I mean do you know how long this answer could go on for? If I had to show you the difference between natural lashes and permed lashes, between normal lashes and volume enhanced lash extensions, between unshaped and shaped brows, between natural and filled lips, to show the before and after effects of cheek fillers, botox, spray-tans, skin primers (or specialised photo-fluids, from watered down glycerol right up to tone-correcting, full-body illuminators); to show how limbs are digitally lengthened, facial features made bigger or smaller, moved around, backgrounds digitally altered to better flatter people’s skin-tone, how things like armhair or peach fuzz are often permanently removed (the latter partly because it gets in the way of makeup) and all the rest I’d be here all week. While saying nothing of the enormous benefits of time and money in staying physically healthy and in shape to begin with when one has access to personal trainers, chefs, dietitians, a near limitless food budget, the option to attend celebrity gyms, goal-oriented boots camps, and so much else. Or in simply being able to pay publicists and lawyers to control your public image and make sure only the most flattering, pre-approved images are distributed, to negotiate with paparazzi by supplying scheduled photo ops when you’re fully prepped in exchange for leaving you alone when you’re not, and much else besides.",0
571703319183302656,Avril lavigne is ugly she have no telant,"In other words never underestimate what’s involved in making celebrities, many of whom are rather average, some of whom actually have deeply flawed features, look the way they look, in contriving super-humanly perfect images for the purpose of selling things, or the level to which some will go to control the public perception of their appearance.

571703319183302656,Avril lavigne is ugly she have no telant,The part even make-up plays is vastly bigger than most people think. Makeup can create many profound illusions; altering the apparent shape and disposition of someone’s face and features more or less at will. Moreover you can do all of this working with neutral and natural colours to create these illusions in a way that don’t appear to be the result of make-up.,0
571703319183302656,Avril lavigne is ugly she have no telant,"%3E Neither of these images is using less makeup. It’s just that the makeup in the right example is not readily obvious because it’s carefully colour matched and intended to look natural.
Hell even something as simple as the shape, colour and thickness of a person’s eyebrows is an entire crazy sub-discipline within the beauty field, and there’s a reason why the people at the top of the industry, the rock-stars of brow-grooming with their A-list clients make small fortunes doing nothing else. The effect that shaping and tinting brows can have on someone’s eyes, even their face overall, is tremendous. In fact it can be hard to really nail down just how profound a difference your brows do make unless you’ve been brow-blocked.",0

571703319183302656,Avril lavigne is ugly she have no telant,Never underestimate the power of good brows. Most women already know this of course. Though if you’re still in doubt let’s simply change her brow shape to something less flattering:,0

571703319183302656,Avril lavigne is ugly she have no telant,Then you have the effect played by lighting. For example:,0
571703319183302656,Avril lavigne is ugly she have no telant,"Bad lighting in the first image. The second is probably using reflected and diffused sunlight. As you can see the difference is profound. The framing of a shot can also have a huge influence on how good it’s subject looks, with simple, perspective-based tricks able to create dramatic illusions. Like in the following picture, making the subjects legs look unnaturally long. By comparing how enormous her feet are next to her head or hand we can determine the radical difference between these two points in the image’s depth of field and get an understanding of just how silly and unrealistic it looks, but a casual viewer is not going to be focusing on such details.",0

For example on a ‘perfect,’ face your eyes would be separated by one eye width of distance, and large eyes are are almost universally considered attractive, yet tiny, extremely wide-set eyes are considered a huge asset to commercial models as they make for an amazing canvas.",0
571703319183302656,Avril lavigne is ugly she have no telant,"%3E Note, I couldn’t find clean Polaroid of this particular model so take the first image with a grain of salt.
And I’ve yet to even mention hair. The style of which can have absolutely dramatic influence on a person’s apparent face-shape, hide many flaws, and even the colour can have a huge impact with lighter hair highlighting the face and darker hair shading it. If you have the money you can even have your hairline itself completely re-shaped to help alter your face shape, remove things like a widows peak, or to even make your forehead higher in order to give your face better lateral symmetry.",0
571703319183302656,Avril lavigne is ugly she have no telant,"Here are two highly staged studio shots of the same women from the last image with a similar, ‘minimalist,’ style of makeup, taken from roughly the same angle. The biggest difference is her hair colour and style.",0
571703319183302656,Avril lavigne is ugly she have no telant,"With her hair swept back her forehead looks larger, her eyes and lips look smaller, and the dark colour does her no favours as she doesn’t have an especially strong bone structure, while in the opposing image her small, wide-set eyes are not even noticeable, her lips seem much larger, and the blonde hair helps to highlight her face. Note how much more vivid her eye colour seems. This isn’t just the highlighting effect either. You might imagine darker hair should contrast better with lighter eye colours, but that hair colour is a tint of yellow which contrasts strongly with blue. Though of course it’s the hair over the face that makes the most dramatic difference. This is such a simple trick. The human brain has what you might call, ‘face recognition software,’ and is amazing at filling in blanks and extrapolating about what we can’t see based on what we can. It’s why when artists draw hair they do not have to draw every individual strand to make it look convincing. In this case because everything we can see is nice when our brain fills in the blanks it assumes everything we can’t see must be equally nice due to a halo-effect like bias.",0
571703319183302656,Avril lavigne is ugly she have no telant,"Now hair is not my speciality but I still know enough to know that this example is barely scratching the surface of the astonishing ways a good hairstyle, or - as in this case - what you might call hair ‘arrangement,’ (which need not reflect any sort of tenable day-to-day style) can transform someone’s face.",0
571703319183302656,Avril lavigne is ugly she have no telant,"There are so many examples of how you can create illusions by way of what people can’t see, and the entire concept of posing is largely about creating these illusions when it comes to body-shape.",0

The processing of commercial images after they’ve been photographed is in no way a new thing as the term airbrushing makes clear.

571703319183302656,Avril lavigne is ugly she have no telant,"Now another comparison, and remember when you see these two images side-by-side that the first is of a woman whose sole job requirement is to look as good as possible, who has more time and money to invest in her appearance than the average person can even fathom, and who is already benefiting from every physical contrivance I’ve already mentioned; full makeup, flattering angles, diffused, reflected lighting, and a host of other cosmetic enhancements I won’t even try to cover. Yet all this is apparently still not good enough.",0
571703319183302656,Avril lavigne is ugly she have no telant,"Now some of this can be done with physical makeup too like the cleavage contouring. That’s it’s own crazy sub-discipline, and is often done terribly as in a later image I’ll show you, but you can’t use makeup to remove creases, shrink someone’s waist, enlarge their breasts, remove the furrows between their brows (why is that a bad thing?!) make a swimsuit look like it was painted on, straighten someone’s crotch (why on earth was this deemed necessary?!) make that little bit of skin bulging over the top of a tight swimsuit smaller, and give people that all-over glow that makes them look like a comic book illustration. You also can’t erase nipples (because think of the children!) whether as a result of tight clothes, or simply so that images which would otherwise be deemed pornographic (at least outside Europe, as they’re not allergic to nipples there) can be put on billboards and the like, and so much else besides.",0
571703319183302656,Avril lavigne is ugly she have no telant,"There is also body contouring with makeup, spray tanning and digital artists working to shade and highlight people’s bodies.

571703319183302656,Avril lavigne is ugly she have no telant,"Incidentally if you’re wondering how they get that magical glow without actually looking sweaty and flushed it’s a mixture of glycerol and water sprayed out of a bottle.

571703319183302656,Avril lavigne is ugly she have no telant,Yeah. There is no conceivable universe in which the contouring around her breasts would resemble natural shadows. The thing is people are so used to seeing contouring and generally unaware of its purpose that even the worst of it is effectively invisible to the average consumer.,0
571703319183302656,Avril lavigne is ugly she have no telant,"And all this is just a glimpse, a small glimpse, of the amount of effort, money, and contrivance that goes into making people who can afford it, or who are being used to sell you something look as ‘good,’ (quotation marks because I personally find a lot of the CGI fakery creepy myself) as possible. I mean do you know how long this answer could go on for? If I had to show you the difference between natural lashes and permed lashes, between normal lashes and volume enhanced lash extensions, between unshaped and shaped brows, between natural and filled lips, to show the before and after effects of cheek fillers, botox, spray-tans, skin primers (or specialised photo-fluids, from watered down glycerol right up to tone-correcting, full-body illuminators); to show how limbs are digitally lengthened, facial features made bigger or smaller, moved around, backgrounds digitally altered to better flatter people’s skin-tone, how things like armhair or peach fuzz are often permanently removed (the latter partly because it gets in the way of makeup) and all the rest I’d be here all week. While saying nothing of the enormous benefits of time and money in staying physically healthy and in shape to begin with when one has access to personal trainers, chefs, dietitians, a near limitless food budget, the option to attend celebrity gyms, goal-oriented boots camps, and so much else. Or in simply being able to pay publicists and lawyers to control your public image and make sure only the most flattering, pre-approved images are distributed, to negotiate with paparazzi by supplying scheduled photo ops when you’re fully prepped in exchange for leaving you alone when you’re not, and much else besides.",0

He's so full of shit..,"Friendship is just as important to Cristiano Ronaldo as winning any championship is, and that is something we definitely value in a person. When a guy understands that friends are what help you get through life and achieve the greatest things, it's a good sign. And it is also a great reason to fall more in love with this great soccer player. Whether they are teammates who have turned in to life-long friends, family members that also double as friends, or just his “mates” as he calls him that come to visit, Cristiano makes time for those social connections. This is just another way we see Cristiano knowing how to balance the different aspects of life. Yes, he focuses on his career and that is very important to him, but he also wants to make sure he is giving the time and energy and thankfulness to those people who make his life even more enjoyable -- aka his friends.",0

526049230126063616,I fucking hate Cristiano Ronaldo. He's so full of shit..,"Any guy who can post a good selfie with a duck face is amazing in our books! Cristiano can make any duck face look hot. He doesn't care that the duck face is a typically a female thing, he owns it. Whether he is doing it to show off his perfectly plump lips or as a joke in some of his pictures, he makes it look good. That’s another thing: Cristiano can make pretty much anything look good, and not a lot of people have that talent. What some people would consider embarrassing or something you just shouldn’t post on your Instagram page, he doesn’t really care. He is going to display himself in whatever way he chooses. That is a good life lesson right there if I’ve ever heard one. Cristiano Ronaldo giving us duck lips in his selfie should encourage us to do whatever the heck we want without worrying about what other people will say about it.",0
526049230126063616,I fucking hate Cristiano Ronaldo. He's so full of shit..,"They say the way to every woman's heart is by making her laugh, and Cristiano Ronaldo has got that down. A man with a sense of humor is easy to fall in love with, which is another reason to love Cristiano. Whether he is acting silly with his friends, doing something crazy with his little boy, or making a bit of a fool of himself in the gym, Cristiano Ronaldo is always on the search for a good time, lots of smiles, and tons of laughter. Like any good man, he understands that if you work hard, it means you need to play even harder. And he takes this literally while on the field, and as an excuse to always be having a good time. Taking kissing face pictures with his son, throwing up the peace sign, doing his thing, Cristiano Ronaldo will definitely put a smile on your face, and we love him for it.",0
526049230126063616,I fucking hate Cristiano Ronaldo. He's so full of shit..,"We love Cristiano Ronaldo's son... almost as much as we love Cristiano himself. What is more attractive and lovable than a man who is an amazing father? The closest thing is probably a man playing with a puppy in a park, but we still think that dad things trump that. It melts our hearts every time we see him playing with his son, taking him on trips, hugging on him and spending quality time with him. As a professional athlete, it would be easy for Cristiano Ronaldo to put his son on the back burner and put all of his focus into his career, but this is not the case. Instead, Cristiano posts pictures on his Instagram of his son in the locker room with him. It's as if he has made him a part of the team as well. He puts that little boy first, and that is just another reason we can't help but love Cristiano Ronaldo.",0

Not to mention his perfect body and beautifully chiseled abs. He is definitely a sight for sore eyes. Just one look, and it is hard not to fall in love with such a good looking man. But what if I told you there are so many other reasons to love him even more. I know, it's hard to believe that such a good looking man could also have so many amazing qualities, but it's true. Cristiano Ronaldo is a full package kind of guy. Not only does he have the looks, but he also has the drive, the character, the passion, and the kindness every lady wants in a man. If you have fallen in love with him because of his good looks, we don't blame you. But check out these other 15 reasons to love Cristiano Ronaldo even more.",1
526049230126063616,I fucking hate Cristiano Ronaldo. He's so full of shit..,"Guys who take care of themselves, work out, are super strong and are generally active are just crazy attractive. Cristiano Ronaldo not only does all that but he takes it one step further by being an amazing professional football (soccer) athlete. He works hard and he plays hard, which is another reason to love this man. He trains hard in the gym and then shows us what he's got on the soccer field. And not only does he play, he is good! It's always fun to cheer for your favorite good-looking player, but it's even better when they actually know how the play the game and can slay everyone in their way. Yes, Cristiano Ronaldo has the looks, but he also has the talent to go along with it, and that is yet another reason why we love him. But there are a whole lot of reasons, as you'll see!",1
526049230126063616,I fucking hate Cristiano Ronaldo. He's so full of shit..,"There is just something about foreign guys that makes them so lovable. Cristiano Ronaldo is from Portugal, and beyond his good looks, we love him for that. You may not be able to understand him in his interviews when he is speaking a different language, but you definitely still listen anyway. He could sing you foreign love songs every night and you would never get tired of hearing them. Even more, he is proud of where he is from and he works hard to make his country proud of him. We love that Cristiano Ronaldo is a foreign man who is proud of where he is from and makes where he is from a part of his identity. In fact, we love him so much we're about to go grab our passports and head over to Portugal to see this beautiful man in all his glory. We're totally serious about this.",1
526049230126063616,I fucking hate Cristiano Ronaldo. He's so full of shit..,"A man who takes selfies is definitely a real man. And we love Cristiano Ronaldo for blessing us with multiple selfies on his Instagram page. Whether he is being super silly, posing with his son, or giving us yet another look at his beautiful eyes, we think the fact that Cristiano Ronaldo takes selfies for days is pretty good. This shows a confident man who happy to show his smiling face to the world. He likes who he is and is proud to show that to the world. And we like who he is too, so we will gladly take it. Though taking selfies has been made fun of some, and there is a somewhat negative view around it, Cristiano doesn't care. He does what he wants, and he when he wants to show us that he is laying out by the pool getting some sun to add more beautiful color to himself or that he is loving all of his fans that come to celebrate with him, we love him for it.",1
526049230126063616,I fucking hate Cristiano Ronaldo. He's so full of shit..,"Cristiano Ronaldo definitely loves his family which makes us love him even more. Family is very important to him, and he shows this by the way he celebrates and appreciates the time he does get to have with his family. Because he has to travel a lot to play professional soccer, it is not like he gets to spend time with them every day. But you do see him traveling with his family when he can and giving them shoutouts and lots of love with heart emojis on his social media and in his interviews. It could be easy for Cristiano to lose sight of everything a family has to offer in light of all the fortune and fame he has, but you see him getting in a lunch date with the whole crew, and it makes us happy. Thank you, Cristiano Ronaldo, for giving us yet another reason to love you.",1
526049230126063616,I fucking hate Cristiano Ronaldo. He's so full of shit..,"We love Cristiano Ronaldo, and he loves us, which then makes us love him even more. Yes, he is famous for being a professional athlete, but that doesn't make him cocky or act like he is too good for us normal people. In fact, he is very thankful for his fan base because he knows it is their support and encouragement that help keep him going when games get tough. They are loyal to him, and he shows appreciation to that. On his Instagram page, you can find him taking pictures with his fans and thanking them for their support. As long as you don't turn into some super creepy stalker fan girl and keep it to a normal obsession, Cristiano is totally cool with that. A man who can show thanks for his fans by including them in the celebration of the game, is definitely a man worth loving.",1
526049230126063616,I fucking hate Cristiano Ronaldo. He's so full of shit..,"Not only is he an awesome soccer player, but he also inspires others to do great things with their life, too. Instead of keeping the focus on him and everything he's amazing at, he wants to reach other people and change their lives for the better. We mean, come on, what's not to love? On his posts and during interviews he always mentions the importance of following your heart and your dreams in order to achieve all that you want in life. He is definitely representation that hard work is the way to success and this should be a lesson for everyone who follows him and sees how he lives his life. Just by seeing all he has accomplished, one can be inspired to go out and accomplish great things themselves. In this way, Cristiano Ronaldo is a great role model, and it gives us another reason to love him.",1
526049230126063616,I fucking hate Cristiano Ronaldo. He's so full of shit..,"Yes, he has been called the greatest soccer player in the world multiple times, but Cristiano Ronaldo is such a team player. He makes sure to give credit to his entire team when they win, and he knows he couldn't be the great player he is without the support of the other players both on and off the field. He has a great relationship with his teammates and their bond is what helps them win games. If he was all stuck up and liked the glory to be focused all on him, it would be hard to justify his good looks as a good reason to like him. But we don't have to worry about that. A guy who is a star, but who is always a team player, is definitely something to love in a man. He publicly talks about how much he loves his team and he definitely seems super thankful to be in the place that he is.",1

Of course, it helps that he has extremely muscular and hot legs. So really, we don't mind at all! He's definitely that perfect combination of confident and hilarious. Most guys these days would have some rude comments about his outfit choices sometimes, but we think they're just jealous they can't pull off that look as well as Cristiano Ronaldo. It may be a culture thing, or it may just be a him thing, but whatever the reason we love Cristiano in his short-shorts and we hope he continues to wear them as he does - in the gym, on the field, and just hanging out by the pool, which is our particular favorite because he rarely has a shirt on in those pictures. Not only is he good looking, but he shows it off for everyone to see. Thank you, Cristiano.",1
526049230126063616,I fucking hate Cristiano Ronaldo. He's so full of shit..,"Yes, Cristiano Ronaldo in a soccer uniform is a beautiful sight, but have you seen the other glam he puts on? Cristiano has a great fashion sense, and we just love him for it. From the watches he shows off, to his perfectly done hair, to seeing him all dressed up in a white suit, we can't get enough. It's one thing for a man to be attractive, it's a whole different (and even better) thing for a man to know how to dress in a way that makes a statement. Cristiano Ronaldo definitely knows how to make that statement. We mean, how often do you see a man rocking the white pants? He's not even just wearing them, he's looking absolutely amazing! From casual to classy, Cristiano has mastered all things fashion. He even knows how the rock the big diamond earrings, and he does it well. What a man.",1

He's so full of shit..,"Cristiano Ronaldo has been given the title of the greatest soccer player in the world, he's on the winning team of the Champions League as well as many other highly valued titles, and still he is humble. He knows that he didn't get to where he is now because he was granted a magic wish. No, he worked hard. He had to fight through injuries, losses, and more and he still came out on top. He has every reason to be proud of what he has accomplished, but he still makes sure to remember where it all started and how he had to grow to get to the place he is now. Even more, he gives credit to his teammates, his country, his fans, and knows how to be confident in himself without boasting the point of arrogance. A man who is able to find that balance is even more lovable than just a good looking man.",1
526049230126063616,I fucking hate Cristiano Ronaldo. He's so full of shit..,"He followed his dreams and became who he wanted to be, and he keeps pushing forward, unafraid to go after what he loves and be completely himself in the process. This is an inspiration in itself for us to do the same. If he wants to post selfies, he does. If he wants to give us a duck face in those selfies, he does that too. He is funny, professional, a hard worker, and best of all, he is himself. Yes, Cristiano Ronaldo is good looking - there is no denying that. But it’s all his other attributes that make him who he is that draw us to love him even more. Keep being you, Cristiano, it’s definitely working for you. We wouldn’t change a thing... expect maybe having you fall in love with us. But that’s just a minor detail. We’ll cross that path when we get there. In the meantime, we're super glad to bask in the glory of your success, talent, and super cute looks.",1

He's so full of shit..,"Becoming like Cristiano Ronaldo is a big deal, one of the toughest challenge; but not impossible. unlike Messi, it's impossible to be like the Argentinian because he is gifted, simply no one except God can make you like him. In Ronaldo case, he was an average kid just like every one, nothing spectacular, nothing extraordinary like Messi's ball control or goal scoring abilities. Ronaldo wanted himself to be the best, his will to reach the peak made him best. He would go to the ground first, leave at last, work in gym until his coach will force him to leave. He was simply not ready to put boundaries around him, nothing bothered him- with every failure he would come stronger. He had only one goal- to see the ball behind the net and to watch the goal keeper tasting the dust, no matter at what cost or what means. To become like Ronaldo in any parallel field you will have to make huge sacrifices, work hardest, and the will to not to stop after getting fails.",0

526049230126063616,I fucking hate Cristiano Ronaldo. He's so full of shit..,"* Look at Messi’s free-kicks when he was young, he wasn’t very good at them and didn’t attempt much of them. Now he is considered among the best free-kick takers in the world.
 * Look at Messi’s playmaking when he was young. Above average, sure, but far from being great at it. Now he is considered one of the best playmakers in the world.
 * Look at Messi’s penalties in the 2015/2016 season : 4/8 were converted, that is bad. Look at him in the 2016/2017 season : he scored 9/10 pens. I think that was the best record in Europe that season.
Do you see a pattern here ? When he has a weakness, he works on it and perfects it. That takes a lot of hard work, but since it is all technical and not physical, people do not notice it. I want to highlight that word : TECHNICAL. He works very hard on his technique and it shows on the pitch.",0

526049230126063616,I fucking hate Cristiano Ronaldo. He's so full of shit..,"Messi is pure talent, his game is music. His game is a painting. His game is a ballet. How do you describe a ballet, a painting, a composition with numbers? With statistics? As Ray Hudson regularly puts it, almost ad nauseam, it's not statistics, it's not the numbers, or as Oliver Holt described it, “He is one of the great performers on any stage, in any era. He is Nureyev. He is Olivier. He is Rostropovich. He is Picasso. He is Sinatra. He is someone who brings joy to everyone who sees him on a football pitch and marvels at the beauty of his art.” Messi is an artist, he touches that something in the locus of human feelings which only a handful of players in the world could in the past, like Ronaldinho, like Maradona, like Cruyff, that something makes you gasp at the artistic ease with which each pass and each shot is made, how it seamlessly flows like the music from a flute or a violin. Messi is blessed with this talent, that divine, elysian beauty that cannot be described by algebra or arithmetic. He's like the Joker to Ronaldo's batman, almost irrational, his game's qualitative appraisal escaping the confines of rational metrics.",0

526049230126063616,I fucking hate Cristiano Ronaldo. He's so full of shit..,In my opinion:-,0
526049230126063616,I fucking hate Cristiano Ronaldo. He's so full of shit..,"1. Playing in different leagues:- While Messi has kept his promise to Vilanova to stay, CR7 has meanwhile joined big clubs like Man U, RM and now Juventus and not just joined them but cemented him as one of the best players. So different leagues, exposure to more fans and hence more the fan following
2. Physical domination:- Messi isn’t exactly the physical athlete and focuses more on his talent and vision. CR7 has his talent too but he has worked hard for his current fitness after he was called skinny in his early days. So if you have a player who is well ahead on physicality, have clear-cut abs, strong biceps and leg muscles, jump power as if on a trampoline and is just packed with fitness- he becomes a role model for many. Also, people admire physicality in an athlete
3. Vocal and Visual:- Messi has a simple life on and off the pitch while on the other hand CR7 knows how to be in the limelight. It’s not like Messi doesn’t hates to loose but CR7 shows it more on the pitch, visual. Brand endorsments, donations, launching his own brands, winning international trophies, activity on instagram- he is always more visible and vocal than Messi- hence fans are able to connect with him more.
4. Aggressive and good looking- It’s natural any fan will consider following F1 racing more than a gentleman game like cricket. People love aggression. CR7 is exactly that and his slight arrogant nature, which he has earned makes him even more known amongst the fans. When it is coupled with the extremely good looks he have, no fans want anything more.
5. Sudden rise- He was good even before but there were always one or the other boxes which remained unticked with one remains that Messi was better than him. Then suddenly he started to prove everyone he is here to fight. He went from 4–1 to 5–5 in the Balloon D Or, in last year he was on the podium while Messi wasn’t. He created records and became a boss in Champions League- which has a massive coverage and this golden period of his, attracted a lot of fans. His discipline and workaholic nature have created like a magnetic field and people prefer him over Messi.

 * Zlatan is spot on here.Ronaldo is surely a trained product.Messi arguably the greatest player ever to grace the game.He is a supreme talent and worked really hard to get there.There are so many players who are talented than Ronaldo but most of them fade into oblivion because of their poor attitude.Mario Balotelli is a great example of wasted talent.Ronaldo,on the other hand,is less talented than Messi,but developed into a beast of a player only with his hard work and dedication.
 * Ronaldo,when he came to United, was often called a show pony .He was considered a very selfish player who had very poor decision making abilities.Sir Alex brought him because of his trickery and he believed that Ronaldo can take United up an extra level if he could use those skills for the benefit of the team.Because of his tricks,flicks and step overs,Ronaldo was most fouled player during his time at United.Critics were quick to point out that he dives a lot and plays to win fouls for the team.Sir Alex explained it to him that “Everyone is looking for you to fail,Everybody sees you as the enemy…You gotta rise up to it,you gotta be stronger in your mentality.The only way you can wear the opponent down is to get up and get on with it.”That beating he took on the pitch made made that lanky portuguese boy into a man.

526049230126063616,I fucking hate Cristiano Ronaldo. He's so full of shit..,"Do you think a loved player will ever be left out of a dream team? Cristiano is one of the most, if not the most hated players of all time. He is also one of the most loved if not the most loved. There is 50–50 split. You either despise him (All non-Real Madrid and Manchester United supporters) or you love him almost unconditionally for what he has done for your team. There are neutrals but they are too far and few in between.",0
526049230126063616,I fucking hate Cristiano Ronaldo. He's so full of shit..,"Messi gets a lot of love too but a lot less hate in comparison. Most Real Madrid (not Ronaldo) fans do not hate Messi. They do not cringe when he does well. Same can’t be said for most Barcelona fans who always find some new stat to prove Ronaldo less than he is. Messi, as a result is always the safer bet to include in your dream 11 and Cristiano is conveniently left out cuz he is, according to them, “just a goalscorer” and the team already has a lot of other goalscorers…",0
526049230126063616,I fucking hate Cristiano Ronaldo. He's so full of shit..,"Come to think about it, it makes me sad for Cristiano. After contributing so much to the game, he is always going to be the first one to be forgotten by non-Real Madrid/Manchester United supporters… In fact it has already started. His stardom is already being attributed to his looks rather than his football in some of the other answers on this question. They reduced him first to just a goalscorer, then to just his looks. It is sad, really.",0
526049230126063616,I fucking hate Cristiano Ronaldo. He's so full of shit..,"Though I am a Ronaldo fan but the thing you mentioned ""Ronaldo is liked more than Messi"" is debatable.

526049230126063616,I fucking hate Cristiano Ronaldo. He's so full of shit..,"Well obviously he is more smart and handsome than Messi. We all agree on this already. And then being so handsome, you get a lot of advertisements, sponsorship's and other media stuff that makes you popular. And moreover, Cristiano is very generous and kind person. As a human, he is really nice. That makes him more like-able.",0

526049230126063616,I fucking hate Cristiano Ronaldo. He's so full of shit..,"I'm not sure if Cristiano is liked more than Messi or has just done a better job of marketing himself. Of course Real Madrid fans will always like Ronaldo better and Barca for Messi. Also Cristiano is a model and brings more women who otherwise would be disinterested into the equation. He has done a great job selling perfume, underwear and his image. Messi appeals more to soccer purists and kids because of his childlike joy and small stature.",0
526049230126063616,I fucking hate Cristiano Ronaldo. He's so full of shit..,I think it is more of the other way around. Many people like Messi and hate Ronaldo.,0
526049230126063616,I fucking hate Cristiano Ronaldo. He's so full of shit..,"The reasoning is because people find Ronaldo to be cocky and Messi to be humble. But neither is true, the only difference is that Ronaldo speaks his mind and speaks his goals into existence. An example of this is this year during the Champions League in the second leg versus Atletico Madrid. Juventus was down 2–0 and Ronaldo said before the match even started that he was going to score a hat trick and bring Juventus to the round of 16. Same day he hit the field and scored an insane hat trick.",0
526049230126063616,I fucking hate Cristiano Ronaldo. He's so full of shit..,"Messi and Ronaldo are both the best football players to ever grace the field, but the hate that you see on either of them is dumb fans who aren’t really football fans, but are rather fanboys of either athletes. Any true football fan can come to appreciate their rivals elegance with the ball at their feet and their will to win every game.",0
526049230126063616,I fucking hate Cristiano Ronaldo. He's so full of shit..,My answer is I adore Ronaldo because he worked extremely hard to be where he is right now.,1
526049230126063616,I fucking hate Cristiano Ronaldo. He's so full of shit..,* He is a complete player.He played for arguably two of the biggest clubs in world football and became the prima donna there.He adapted really quickly and evolved into a phenomenal player.He currently averages more than one goal per game for Real Madrid and that is an astonishing fact for a winger.,1
526049230126063616,I fucking hate Cristiano Ronaldo. He's so full of shit..,* He is brave as a Lion.He takes up responsibility when the team needs him. The best example is his magnificent hat-trick against Sweden which qualified Portugal for the 2014 FIFA WC.Watch his lethal finishing below.,1
526049230126063616,I fucking hate Cristiano Ronaldo. He's so full of shit..,* His brilliant performance against Hungary in EURO 2016 which kept the eventual champions Portugal in the tournament.Watch his performance below.(2 goals and 1 assist),1
526049230126063616,I fucking hate Cristiano Ronaldo. He's so full of shit..,"* He was a master at taking the free kicks at United.When others were trying to master the art,Ronaldo was inventing new techniques to smash the free kicks. He mastered that unique Knuckle-ball free-kick technique . In this free-kick the ball swerved TWICE in the air.",1
526049230126063616,I fucking hate Cristiano Ronaldo. He's so full of shit..,"* Ronaldo did not like heading the ball.He thought that the concept of heading the ball was beneath him.He thought why would I want to head the ball when I have a dynamite in my boots?.It reached to a point where his team mates at United made a mickey out of him because heading the ball would mess up his hairstyle.When he realized that heading the ball would get him an additional 10 goals , he worked very hard on that aspect and became one of the best in the world.Because of his upper body strength, he could generate a lot of power and hang in the air. Look at the amount of power he generates in this header in the following video.He literally takes the Roma defender out.",1
526049230126063616,I fucking hate Cristiano Ronaldo. He's so full of shit..,"He developed those attributes by spending thousands of hours on the pitch & gym and it has eventually paid him off.Now, its fair to argue that all the professional footballers spend a lot of time honing their skills and physique.But,a very select few have the ability to produce the goods week in and week out. Ronaldo,along with Messi and Zlatan,has been doing that every season consistently since 2006 . He went from England to Spain and that transition had made him only better.His team mates and coaches speak very highly of his work ethic and that itself is a testament for what believing in hard work can do for an average player coming from a very modest background.",1
526049230126063616,I fucking hate Cristiano Ronaldo. He's so full of shit..,"Cristiano Ronaldo, however, has been conveniently left out of most of the higher voted answers with the legendary players.

526049230126063616,I fucking hate Cristiano Ronaldo. He's so full of shit..,He's a brand. He advertises himself well courtesy of his looks. By God's grace he's always in the news be it his controversial life or records.,1
526049230126063616,I fucking hate Cristiano Ronaldo. He's so full of shit..,"That's because of his style of play. He doesn't dribbles like Messi but do you think he needs to. Look at his goal scoring average. His overstepping skills, side runs, Rebecca kicks, deadly free kicks are a treat to watch. He's like a freestyle footballer in the field just with 21 players more.",1
526049230126063616,I fucking hate Cristiano Ronaldo. He's so full of shit..,"Because he has all childlike features:
1. Energetic
2. Focused in what he likes
3. Ruthless (for achieving target)
4. His celebrations like Claw. 
Other reasons:
1. Even when I started football, just like 99% Indians, I started with ManU. Rooney and Ronaldo became everyone's role model. 
2. The ManU-Real transfer made him further popular. 
3. A demi-God of football (come on, we know the God. Messi all the way)",0

526049230126063616,I fucking hate Cristiano Ronaldo. He's so full of shit..,"United then signed him, and after a season or two of showboating and histrionics, he knuckled down under Fergie’s direction and became the best player in the world. Let’s not forget here that Ronaldo, carried that United team for a good 3–4 years. He was our talisman and everything went through him. He made things happen and could produce magic from nothing. In over 35 years of being a season ticket holder at Manchester United, I’ve never seen a better or more influential player - and that includes Keano. Ronaldo led by example and his impact on the team was galvanizing and cannot be underestimated.",0
526049230126063616,I fucking hate Cristiano Ronaldo. He's so full of shit..,"He then joined a very workmanlike Madrid in 2009. Now, make no mistake, Madrid have always had a decent team but, when Ronaldo joined, they weren’t great. They had good players but, none were of the calibre that Messi had around him at Barcelona (and that 2008 - 2012 Barca team remains the greatest club side I have ever seen).",0
526049230126063616,I fucking hate Cristiano Ronaldo. He's so full of shit..,"Slowly but surely, Ronaldo's influence on the Madrid team started to take hold. By hook or by crook they started to challenge Barcelona and their wrestling back of the La Liga title in 2012 against the best club side in history was a stunning achievement and Ronaldo, more than any other Madrid player, was instrumental in that title win. Added to that he has won four European cups (five with United) and has averaged something like 50 goals a season for nigh on ten years. That is an insane statistic and especially so when you consider the teammates he’s had around him. The fact none of his teammates have got anywhere close to his returns tell you all you need to know. The guy is a freak of nature and the only comparable player is Messi.",0

Also, a high percentage of his goals came in friendlies against woeful opposition and had he tried his hand in Europe, my guess is he wouldn’t be anywhere near the elevated position of GOAT’s he currently finds himself.

526049230126063616,I fucking hate Cristiano Ronaldo. He's so full of shit..,Ok let us agree. Cristiano has almost the perfect body. He is extremely lean putting the scales at less than 10%BF. His lack of excess weight put less pressure on his joints which do not get damaged that easily.,1

Even the thought of Cristiano being the only player to work out at his home is funny,but he is the only one to post it on social media,you should check it up. It is not a secret that usually after practice in the Real base he goes at home and does exercise but most of all stationary bike which helps his hip flexors stay strong and lets his muscle wind down after the day's work.",1

I am not saying that he does not give world class passes but at times, he becomes selfish and tries to net the goal himself when there is a player marked free somewhere to whom he could pass the ball easily.

He’s certainly the most prolific striker we’ve ever seen if not the most blessed skillfully. What ranks Ronaldo as one of the GOAT’s in my opinion, is his work ethic. This is not to denigrate the likes of Messi or others but, unlike Messi, Ronaldo has never been fortunate enough to be integrated into a team already overflowing with world stars. Messi’s Barca was already the world’s best side when he broke through and he simply complimented them and flourished. He’s had it easy by comparison because he’s never had to struggle. Ronaldo, on the other hand, has had to graft to be the best, often carrying teams with inferior players with him.",1

Ronaldo’s supreme talent allowed him to rack up insane amounts of goals and helped his teams to important trophies. Eventually Ronaldo has closed the gap of the Balon D’or lead from 4–1 to an incredible 5–4.

440346829352603649,But Sandra Bullock is bad at acting you dumb stupid idiots,"The space-time continuum smacks the shit out of Sandra Bullock in, the latest in nonlinear nonsense, but the fun really gets going when she starts to smack back. As Linda Hanson, humdrum mom of Anywhere, U.S.A., Bullock sets things up by doing her thing, effortlessly establishing herself as the girl next door (to the loony bin, as we shall see). With a pair of adorable daughters and her handsome husband Jim (Julian McMahon), she seems the happiest of campers, so when later developments  and there will be ever so many of them  require us to think her a complacent ingrate, bored with the comforts of her middle-class cocoon, it doesn't quite parse  which is, I suppose, par for the crazy course of the movie.",0
440346829352603649,But Sandra Bullock is bad at acting you dumb stupid idiots,"One sunny afternoon Linda opens her door to a police officer bearing news that Jim has been horribly mangled in a car accident. Rising from a black night's sleep, she wobbles to the kitchen only to find Jim very much alive, nonchalantly non-mangled, eating a bowl of cereal. Whew, thinks she, gnarliest dream ever, and the day goes by more or less swimmingly. Next morning Linda wakes to find a bottle of lithium in her bathroom, a funeral assembly in her living room, Jim re-mangled, and her eldest daughter ominously posed on a swing set, her face a Frankenstein mess of fresh scars and stitches.",0

440346829352603649,But Sandra Bullock is bad at acting you dumb stupid idiots,"Actually, her reality has been hijacked by an imp of the perverse named Bill Kelly, practitioner of the dark arts of Screwy Screenwriting. Directed with loopy sincerity by Mennan Yapo, Premonition strings its heroine up in a temporal torture apparatus and watches her squirm. There is, for example, a spooky shrink played by Peter Stormare who commits Linda to an institution one day, then listens patiently the ""next"" as she pays visit to his office for the first time, having located him via the lithium bottle, which, of course, he has yet to prescribe. ""Obviously,"" notes the doctor, ""you're dealing with some inconsistencies.""",0
440346829352603649,But Sandra Bullock is bad at acting you dumb stupid idiots,"Tell me about it. You might need to watch Premonition twice to fully sort out its helter-skelter hijinks, though once is more than enough for all other purposes. Yet the real surprise of this chick-flick mindfuck is that once is almost worth it  though not for the bird-brained message about appreciating life, and definitely not for the suggestion that Linda's limbo was triggered by a lack of faith. As an exercise in ""the new cinematic disorder,"" as David Denby recently trademarked the trend of flagrant non-linearity, Premonition may lack the suavity of Babel, but it also escapes from its mirthless pretense and gloomy self regard. Closer in spirit to the schlocky kicks of Déjà Vu, it's a B-level entry in the cracked-continuity genre, with a winningly humble, workmanlike vibe; a poor-man's puzzle picture with a heart of gold  OK, maybe pyrite  and a glinting sense of humor, not all of which may be intentional.",0
440346829352603649,But Sandra Bullock is bad at acting you dumb stupid idiots,"""If I let Jim die, is that the same as killing him?"" Linda wonders in a moment of delicious perplexity. Deep in the sludge of her metaphysical mindfuck, she has unearthed the details of an affair, unconsummated, between Jim and a co-worker (Amber Valletta; can you blame him?). Self-awareness is the thread through the Premonition labyrinth, and the movie kicks into gear when Linda grabs it and yanks. Exhaustion gives way to exasperation as she digs into her existential mess and gets organized, plotting the scramble of events and clues on a large desk calendar and running around town putting the pieces together.",0
440346829352603649,But Sandra Bullock is bad at acting you dumb stupid idiots,"Bullock's affable performance starts strong then muscles up as a faint but lifesaving strain of humor creeps into the material. Otherwise hackneyed, Premonition finds a new groove in this middle stretch as Linda goes from beleaguered to what can only be described as slightly peeved. Had the film maintained a tone of kooky, Kafkaesque tragicomedy, narrowing in on Linda's wacko wrestling match with the laws of physics, we might really have had something here. I'd kill to watch girlfriend whip out a Palm Pilot and start calculating vectors of the vortex.",0

2. She tried doing more serious dramatic acting in things such as In the Cut and Courage Under Fire, and she simply wasn't that believable in those roles.
3. Her highly publicized affair with Russell Crowe did not do her any favors, damaging her reputation.
4. I think she did one too many romantic comedies with Tom Hanks, which somewhat cemented her typecasting. It made it more and more difficult to see her paired up with anyone else, though I liked her a lot in Kate and Leopold with Hugh Jackman. When Harry Met Sally was a great movie, but her pairing with Billy Crystal didn't work.
Sandra Bullock has managed to avoid all of these situations, and has kept herself very clean. The only smudge on her reputation was her divorce from Jesse James, but that was really due to his cheating, not her.",0

She can do action and hold her own or be more of a badass than the male lead — often saving him, not the other way around. Even when she plays a mom, she’s a Grisly badass mom. Even when she plays a victim, she’s doesn’t play that character as being victimized. She plays characters who don’t care what others think of them; the opposite of needy.

2. Crash -- While the film is regularly dismissed and criticized as unworthy of winning an Oscar for Best Picture (I don't consider the film as bad as many others do, but I do think there were other films more worthy of the Oscar that year), I feel that several actors gave really strong performances, especially Bullock. 
3. Gravity -- In a restrained role requiring her to emote about the loss of a  child and of her sense of place in the world, while also emoting utter  terror and panic every few minutes as she faces constant disaster,  Bullock's achieves a perfect balance where other actors might have been  either too understated or too melodramatic.
4. Infamous -- In a supporting role as Harper Lee, Bullock really is one of the best parts of this otherwise good-but-not-great film that had the misfortune of coming out the same year as the Oscar-winning Capote. That other film is superior, but Bullock really shows her acting chops here.
5.

Such men are dangerous” (I., ii). Miller also has a “lean and hungry look.” Although Miller’s passion since he was an assistant to figures such as Rep. Michele Bachmann and Sen. Jeff Sessions has been to limit or end immigration, it is only through his role in the Trump administration that he has been able to put his ideas into policy. Like Cassius, he is practical, shrewd and politically vicious (“I think it is not meet, / Mark Antony, so well beloved of Caesar, / Should outlive Caesar.” (II, i)). Cassius, like Miller, is ambitious and scheming. Like Miller’s plans, Cassius’ initial plans go well, and he is able to effect the social changes he wants. After that, not so much.

Who cares what that old fart thinks. 😂,"I am a big fan of Shakespeare’s “Measure for Measure.” Vincentio, the Duke of Vienna, realizes the city has become a corrupt cesspool of vice (“the swamp”?) and so pretends to travel abroad, placing Angelo, his deputy, in charge, knowing he will clean up the town and the duke will be able to avoid being unpopular for finally enforcing the law (“draining said swamp?”). Things do not go as planned when Angelo falls in love with Isabella, a woman about to become a nun, who petitions him to spare her brother’s life. The brother is due to be executed for the crime of fornication. Angelo agrees to spare his life if Isabella will sleep with him. The duke, now in disguise, manipulates the situation so that all are exposed. Nothing in this story is near what Elizabeth Warren does, but I think of her as the inside reformer, part of the system that needs to be reformed. Also, like Warren’s enemies, the duke’s speak rather unkindly of him (“the duke is a great eater of mutton” — let’s bring back that insult!). In Act V, he reveals all and sweeps reforms through the city, pardoning Angelo for his hypocrisy but forcing him to marry his abandoned fiancée. The duke then informs Isabella that instead of becoming a nun, she will marry him. We are meant to like the duke. He is genuine and genuinely concerned about the citizens under his leadership. Yet there is also something about the way in which he does things that renders him suspect. I see in the polls that same sort of concern for Sen. Warren — what would she do if actually in charge.

1496201212856840193,Newt Gingrich is demented; Cawthorn a mindless apostle.,"In a corner office in the U.S. Capitol, a short stroll down the marble corridor from the room where Speaker of the House Jim Wright is writhing in a stew of ethics charges, the man who's put Wright in that fix seems quite out of sorts himself. ""I'm a controversial guy,"" Newt Gingrich says, with the air of a man who has discovered something surprising about himself. He isn't sure he should make himself available for a magazine story, explaining, ""I'm not up to speed on the national press."" It is an amazing assertion, coming from the congressman who once declared he was ""reshaping the entire nation through the news media,"" who just a week earlier had been quoted in Newsweek as saying, ""If you're not in The Washington Post every day, you might as well not exist."" Gingrich, Congress's own automated-teller machine of quotes, is not up to dealing with the press? Something is definitely wrong. In fact, it has been a terrible week for the chunky, forty-five-year-old Republican congressman from Georgia, and this is only Thursday afternoon. On Tuesday, The New York Times gave prominent display on its op-ed page to an article written by one of Gingrich's most bitter Democratic foes, Representative Bill Alexander of Arkansas, who branded Gingrich a neo-McCarthyite and urged his colleagues to take up the fight against him. Then Gingrich and his wife, Marianne, met with reporters to answer charges (filed by Alexander) of possible improprieties in an unusual book-promotion deal --improprieties loosely similar to those with which Gingrich has charged Speaker Wright. It was a difficult, testy news conference; the press couldn't resist probing the obvious parallels, and after just a few moments Marianne Gingrich stalked out of the press gallery, sobbing. The event landed Newt and Marianne Gingrich on the front page of Wednesday's Washington Post . Thursday is going downhill fast. It began with a morning meeting with House Republican officials in the office of Bob Michel, the minority leader. Gingrich discovered that four Democratic congressmen were asking the House ethics committee to appoint an outside counsel to investigate the charges against him. The next item on his schedule was a National Press Club luncheon, at which he was to be the featured guest. Marianne Gingrich was supposed to attend as well, but she had been so upset that she refused to accompany her husband. Now, when he returns to his office following the lunch, she is on the phone, in tears; a friend from Ohio has called, asking about an account of the press conference in the Cleveland Plain Dealer . ""He is a little testy today,"" says Sheila Ward, Gingrich's faithful young press aide, who has just earned a wicked blast of Gingrich ire for turning up the sound on an office television (tuned, appropriately enough, to C-SPAN, the public-service cable network that covers government). It was probably inevitable that Gingrich, himself an accomplished slinger would get splattered in Washington's current mud bath. Not only is he the man who put Jim Wright, the top Democrat in the country, on the spit, but his decade-long career in the House of Representatives has been one sustained assault on the opposition party --known in the Gingrich lexicon as ""the corrupt left-wing machine"" that exists to perpetuate ""the corrupt liberal welfare state."" Almost from the moment he arrived in town, Gingrich, who looks like Pete Rose (and, for that matter, plays Congress in the headfirst style in which Rose played baseball), has been practicing what he calls ""confrontational activism,"" a standard theme of which is the defeatist psychology of the Soviet-appeasing Chamberlains on the other side of the aisle. But even this is not why Newt Gingrich stands at center stage in the political theater just now. To many in Washington, both those who admire and those who loathe the Georgia representative, Newt Gingrich is the future of American politics, arrived; a hope, or a nightmare, come true. This spring, in an extraordinary jolt to the usually somnolent politics of House Republicans, Gingrich leapt from his niche as a back-bench bomb thrower to the post of minority whip, a key position in a party leadership. His ascension changes the chemistry of politics on Capitol Hill and signals a dramatic new Republican strategy. After thirty-four years as the minority party in Congress, years of deep frustration, the Republicans seem ready to launch an all-out war on Democratic dominance, attacking the Democratic Party as a whole with the same spectacularly successful (if ungentle) tactics that George Bush's campaign managers used against Michael Dukakis in 1988. The Bush campaign sank Dukakis by playing to the national gut --driving the public perception of the Democratic candidate to the far left with such devices as the Willie Horton ads, which portrayed Dukakis as being soft on crime by focusing on Massachusetts's prison-furlough program. (Horton, a scary-looking black man, raped a white woman while on a weekend leave from a Massachusetts prison.) The architect of that campaign, political consultant Lee Atwater, is now chairman of the Republican National Committee, and his former boss, political consultant Ed Rollins, is head of the National Republican Congressional Committee. Atwater was among the first to applaud Newt Gingrich's selection as whip: ""He talks the kinda talk I like."" It is clear that the Atwater-Rollins wing of the party, at least, intends Gingrich to be the Republicans' front man in the drive to do for all of the G.O.P. what Atwater did for George Bush--to ""Willie Horton"" the Democratic House of Representatives by hammering away at the theme of ""institutional corruption."" ""I think Newt Gingrich has an opportunity to have a somewhat unprecedented role for a Republican House member,"" Atwater says. ""He can truly be a national political guru for our party. He can be a spokesman, he can be a philosopher, and he can be a strategist for our party. As Teddy Roosevelt once said about the bully pulpit, Newt Gingrich has an opportunity to be as big a man as he can be."" Gingrich is eager for the role. By Saturday he has shaken off the setbacks of the news conference and the Democrats' attacks--""a smear campaign by Jim Wright's cronies""--and is pounding away once more at the ""corrupt left-wing machine."" He spends most of the day at Atwater's home, plotting strategy. His goal: a Republican majority by 1992. (""And the great thing about Gingrich,"" says Atwater, ""is that he really believes it."") That evening, after attending the White House correspondents dinner, Gingrich makes an appearance on a public-television talk show, where he says that God has given him a mission: ""To find honest self-government and to survive as a free people."" It will be hard for the Democrats to campaign against that. Not surprisingly, Gingrich has often been diminished by his colleagues in the House as a fast-talking demagogue, or worse. Beryl Anthony Jr. of Arkansas,the head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee says simply, ""He's crazy."" In 1985, The Washington Post wrote that ""Newt Gingrich may be just about the most disliked member of Congress."" Why, then, would Republicans choose him as a leader? Because he is a rare and compelling politician. In public meetings and speeches, Gingrich is an extremely engaging fellow. His defense of his book deal before the National Press Club (no pit bulls, but not exactly the Young Republicans, either) prompted thunderous applause. He takes complete possession of the room, even when he's speaking what one critic calls ""GobbledyNewt""--his philosophical mix of futurism, high technology, free enterprise, and space. A former college professor, he has the instructor's command, rather than the lawyer's equivocation, a compelling directness in a world of frayed smiles and glazed expressions. But most of all Gingrich has something that is of great practical value to the Republican just now --the zealot's single-minded drive. It is grounded in a childhood that was divided and rootless. He was born Newton Leroy McPherson near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, in 1943, his parents' only child. His father was in the navy, but his parents broke up after the war, and his mother married a career army officer, who adopted Newt when the youngster was five. Both of Gingrich's parents had children in their second marriages, and although Newt was an army brat, following his mother and stepfather from base to base, he stayed in touch with his natural father. Then, as a fifteen-year-old high school student in France, where his stepfather was stationed, Gingrich was ""called"" to politics. ""I got active in this business of politics and self-government in 1958, when my father, who was serving in the U.S. Army, took us to the battlefield of Verdun."" The boy stared at the bone pile left by the great battle, and ""over the course of the weekend, it convinced me that civilizations live and die by, and that the ultimate margin in a free society of our fate is provided more by, elected political leadership than by any other group. That in the end it's the elected politicians that decide where we fight and when we fight and what the terms of engagement are, and what weapons systems are available."" That awakening, he says, led to a 180-page term paper on the balance of world power. When he turned in the paper, he informed his teacher that his family was being transferred to Fort Benning, Georgia, where he would become a Republican congressman. It is a story that Gingrich tells at least three or four times a week. It is his self-explanation, his Genesis. It is possibly even true. Who would make up a story like that? In any case, Newt Gingrich was a driven lad by the time he arrived at Baxter High School, and politics was his passion --as a junior, he passed out campaign literature for Nixon's 1960 campaign. His singular determination was perhaps best seen in his first successful romance, a schoolboy crush he developed on his high-school math teacher. Lots of boys get romantic notions about pretty young teachers, but Newt Gingrich didn't let go of his. After graduation, when she moved to Atlanta, he went to Atlanta too, enrolling at Emory University. Gingrich pursued his former math teacher, seven years his senior, until Jackie agreed to become his wife. They were married at the end of his freshman year, and soon they had their first child, Kathy. Gingrich then entered that hazy passage through ambiguity experienced by the majority of young American men during the 1960s. Like most of his generation, Gingrich was moderately anti-Establishment (he tried pot, and participated in a campus protest at Tulane University) and chose not to go to Vietnam, opting for deferments available to him as a father and a student. But unlike most young men his age, Gingrich would be haunted by his decision. Later, when, as a hawkish congressman, he would lash out against the ""weak-on-defense left"" and espouse universal military training, his opponents would investigate Gingrich's own military background. Sure enough, he found himself listed among a sizable group of noted conservative hawks (including George Will and Richard Perle) who had managed to avoid the war-the ""war wimps,"" as they came to be called. In 1985, he told Jane Mayer of The Wall Street Journal that he still believed that ""Vietnam was the right battlefield at the right time."" Why didn't he go? ""Given everything I believe in, a large part of me thinks I should have gone over,"" he allowed. But, recovering, he added, ""Part of the question I had to ask myself was what difference I would have made."" After graduating from Emory, he and Jackie and Kathy moved to New Orleans, where the Gingriches had a second daughter, and Newt worked on his graduate degrees in history. He ultimately earned his Ph.D. from Tulane, but maintained his vivid interest in politics throughout. He took a year off in 1964 to manage a congressional campaign in Georgia and worked on Nelson Rockefeller's presidential quest in 1968. In 1970, Gingrich moved his family to Carrollton, a quiet town south of Atlanta, where he took a job teaching environmental studies. One of the things Gingrich liked about the job was its location-in Georgia's Sixth Congressional District, which Gingrich soon identified as the seat of his boyhood visions. The seat, which had been solidly Democratic since Reconstruction, was held by a longtime incumbent, Jack Flynt. Gingrich's first two campaigns, both against Flynt, were unsuccessful, but it was a measure of his political acumen that the races were even close. In 1974 he was hurt by Watergate and Gerald Ford's pardon of Richard Nixon-a political act that he later termed ""just unbelievably dumb. Gerald Ford personally cost me a Congressional seat...Just utterly stupid."" And in 1976 he was hurt by the presence at the top of the Democratic ticket of a native Georgian, Jimmy Carter. But Jack Flynt retired after his 1976 term, and 1978 was Gingrich's year. His Democratic opponent was Virginia Shapard, a state senator. The campaign was so rough that Shapard is still more than a little bitter about it. ""It was, early on, that same sort of technique that you saw in this last campaign at the presidential level,"" she says, ""the Willie Horton type of thing."" Gingrich, seeking to drive Shapard to the left and carve out the middle and right for himself, campaigned as a hard, no-tax, anti-welfare conservative. One Gingrich ad, which Shapard says was particularly effective, showed hands reaching out and grabbing at a pile of dollar bills-taxpayer dollars-""and this voice-over said, 'Virginia Shapard says she's against welfare fraud, but she voted against...' and then they cited the bill number, and it was absolutely devastating."" Another Gingrich theme in that campaign was moral leadership and family values. He drove the point home with an ad claiming that if Shapard were elected to Congress she would leave her husband, a local businessman, behind, while Gingrich would keep his family together. This issue was a subject of particular irony among the Shapard campaign staffers, where gossip about Gingrich's roving eye was widely believed and it was assumed that the Gingrich marriage was on the verge of breaking up. ""As the days dwindled down in the end of the campaign,"" Shapard says, ""the campaign workers had an unofficial pool going on to see how long it would take him when he got to Washington to dump [Jackie.]"" Not long, as it turned out. Jackie Gingrich went to Washington with her newly elected husband, but she did not return for his second term. She says that Gingrich walked out on her in the spring of 1980. That fall, while she was in the hospital recovering from surgery for uterine cancer, he appeared at her bedside with a yellow legal pad outlining the details for their divorce. The next year, he married his current wife, Marianne Ginther, a small-town Ohio woman fifteen years younger than Jackie, who was then a personnel clerk with the Secret Service. ""I was very fond of Jackie, and I felt sorry for the whole way that it turned out for her,"" Shapard says. ""But...you could have written that down before it happened, and many people did."" It's hard now for Jackie Gingrich to talk about her life with Newt. Her daughters are grown, and though she talks with them regularly by phone, Jackie lives alone in Carrollton, still teaching, and tutoring at night. She no longer has any contact with Gingrich whom she refers to as ""the congressman."" ""I do not talk to him, he does not talk to me, and I do not even get junk mail from the office."" In Washington, the second Mrs. Gingrich bristles at the suggestion that she was just the new model that Gingrich traded in for when it became convenient . ""He's a public figure and people will attack him,"" Marianne says. ""He's just got to take it and keep moving."" In fact, she adds, she and Gingrich spent long hours discussing his troubled previous marriage, which was years in the undoing. ""I've seen bills where they both went to marriage counseling before they split up, before she got ill. The documentation is there."" ""When you're the second wife and you're trying to uphold what you did or who you are, you'll say those things"" is Jackie's only comment. Asked about his divorce by The Atlanta Constitution , Newt Gingrich said, ""Even if I had been sensitive, it would've been a mess."" It is not easy to become the most disliked man in Congress in the space of three terms, but Newt Gingrich was no ordinary congressman. Even before he got to Capitol Hill, when he was making his first run in 1974, he said, ""I intend to go up there and kick the system over, not try to change it."" It was not your usual sort of campaign promise, but then, Gingrich did not keep his word on it. When he arrived in Washington, he ignored the traditional course for freshmen congressmen of quietly taking backseat and doing party and committee grunt work while learning the ropes. Instead, he openly cultivated the press and, of course, he developed his romance with C-SPAN. Nothing was so sweet a piece of happenstance as the arrival of Gingrich and C-SPAN in the House of Representatives at the same moment. They were made for each other. A Washington newsman, Brian Lamb, had had the idea of bringing the proceedings of both houses of Congress to American television viewers as a nonprofit public service. Congressional leaders, accustomed to the clubby seclusion of Congress and frankly skeptical about the television appeal of their work, were doubtful --particularly since Lamb wanted gavel-to-gavel coverage --but House Speaker Tip O'Neill eventually gave the go-ahead. Gingrich, the new face, quickly recognized an opportunity. The House, which limits the length of debate over legislation, has a rule allowing so-called special orders --permission to give lengthy speeches at the end of each legislative day. These have long been a means by which congressman could read into the Congressional Record various matters of importance to their constituents, usually matters of trivia. But Gingrich, concerned less with the Record than with the potential television audience, began to use special orders regularly as his platform for advancing ideas and, especially, for attacking the Democratic majority. At first, his approach gave the impression that he was a brave young crusader, taking on the opposition in heated floor encounters, but, in truth, most of his diatribes were delivered before a virtually empty House. When, in 1984, he escalated his attack on Democrats to the point of questioning their patriotism-- accusing them of being ""blind to Communism"" --Speaker O'Neill lost his cool. In a legendary head-to-head encounter on the floor of the House, the Speaker blasted Gingrich : ""You deliberately stood in that well before an empty House, and challenged these people, and challenged their patriotism, and it is the lowest thing that I've ever seen in my thirty-two years in Congress."" The end of the story, however, was a Gingrich coup: Trent Lott, who was then minority whip, protested O'Neill's attack on Gingrich as being out of order, and O'Neill's remarks were stricken from the record. It was the first such rebuke of a Speaker of the House since 1798. Gingrich was famous. Gingrich gradually developed a political manifesto, a sort of New Age Reaganism, and called his blueprint for a new America the ""Conservative Opportunity Society"" (as opposed, of course, to the Liberal Welfare State.) By 19(86?), although he held no committee chair or leadership position, Newt Gingrich was named by The Almanac of American Politics as one of the twenty-six most influential members of the House. His recognition and his gathering power were not the result of the legislation he drafted or helped to pass, which, in fact, was negligible. And he was scorned by detractors for some of his wackier notions --which ranged from the off-the-wall (plans for statehood in outer space) to potential political dynamite (he once proposed abolishing Social Security and replacing it with mandatory I.R.A.'s). Still, Gingrich's accessibility, and his willingness (and ability) to glibly hold forth on his various notions at a moment's notice, gave him a reputation as a brainiac, a kind of walking lecture, and won him some fans within the more activist branch of the Republican Party. Guy Vander Jagt of Michigan, for one, is as impressed with Gingrich as ever. ""In terms of the sweep of intellect and the energy to drive those intellectual conceptualizations, he has no equal."" For Gingrich, politics is his profession, his sport, and his hobby, and his private life is pretty dull. He and Marianne have never been regulars on the party circuit, they have no children, and they have no pets --because Newt is partial to reptiles. (They bought a boa constrictor at one point, which Newt then donated to the zoo; he wanted to keep it, but Marianne knew they wouldn't be able to find neighbors willing to boa-sit when the Gingriches were out of town.) Marianne says she has only one friend in Washington, and much prefers her life back in Georgia: ""I find Washington an extremely cynical, transitional, unstable place --it's not an easy place."" But Newt thrived in the bright light of the recognition he was receiving, to the point, some would suggest, where his ego became a trifle overfed. Even for a town not populated by self-effacing people, Gingrich has said some pretty memorable things, such as his observation to The Atlantic that his attendance at a National Press Club dinner ""made no sense except that the news media could see me walking through the crowds."" Still high from his success at the '84 convention, when he managed to persuade Reagan's speech writers to include the term ""opportunity society"" in the president's address, he told The Washington Post , ""I have an enormous personal ambition. I want to shift the entire planet. And I'm doing it. Ronald Reagan just used the term ""opportunity society"" and that didn't exist four years ago. I just had breakfast with Darman and Stockman because I'm unavoidable. I represent real power."" He was already a favorite target of the Democrats, and such pronouncements made him even easier prey. ""Newt Gingrich can unify the Democratic Party better than anyone in America,"" says Democratic whip Tony Coelho of his longtime opponent. In 1985, some Democratic staff members assembled a collection of Gingrich's quota, and distributed it under the title Talking Heads-A Newt Gingrich Chrestomathy . In May, a sequel (Son of Talking Heads) was produced, and included this Gingrich gem: ""Vision must lead to words. Our vision cannot exist if we cannot say it. Strategy must lead to policies, to strategies, and they must lead to structures for implementation. Operations must be definable tasks for which we can hold people accountable. The tactics on a daily basis must be a doctrine that fits our vision of strategy."" Gingrich had taken on Democrats almost from the moment he hit town, but in May 1988 he went after the big fish: the Speaker of the House. After spending months preparing his case against Wright, he filed charges of ethics violations with the House Committee on Standards of Official conduct. It was a lonely course; while some Republicans privately cheered Gingrich's move, none would join him in those first months as he fought to bring his complaint. The Speaker of the House --any Speaker-- is a force not to be trifled with, and Wright was held to be particularly vindictive. Also, many Republicans were (and are) unsure about the propriety of making ethics a partisan issue; beyond that, there is the ""glass house"" syndrome in Congress, a work unto itself where ethically questionable behavior is sometimes explicitly within the rules. But Gingrich was determined. It was, politically, the perfect moment to attack Wright; the protracted Ed Meese scandal promised to give Democrats the sleaze issue for their convention, and Gingrich's assault blunted that. So he whaled away at Wright, calling him ""the most corrupt Speaker of the twentieth century,"" and was vindicated, to a degree, when the committee issued its report this April. Essentially, it charged Wright with sixty-nine potential violations. The Speaker, asked at the time about his feelings for Gingrich, said they were like those ""of a fire hydrant for a dog."" The Wright triumph proved to be a clear asset to Gingrich in his campaign for party whip, but, ironically, the position had become vacant only because of a Republican ethics mess --the John Tower affair. When Tower was rejected by the Senate in March, President Bush nominated Dick Cheney of Wyoming, who had just been elected minority whip, for secretary of defense. Gingrich was in his field office in Griffin, Georgia, when he heard the news about Cheney's nomination from a USA Today reporter. He made up his mind instantly. ""It was 3:45 in the afternoon,"" he says. ""I decided by the time I hung up. It was so obvious that, having lost Lott [Trent Lott of Mississippi, who'd been elected to the Senate] and Kemp [who'd moved into Bush's Cabinet] and Cheney, we needed somebody with a good deal of drive and energy to fill the vacuum that those three guys left behind them. And so I decided to try it."" It may have seemed obvious to Gingrich, but not to others. The whip's job (the title does in fact derive from a literal use of the word: the ""whipper-in"" at a fox hunt is a man who keeps the hounds together in a pack) is the ultimate inside party position, involving the counting of noses, the corralling and delivering of votes, the building of coalitions. Gingrich was the quintessential party outsider, a freelancer with no known expertise in vote gathering, several well-known antagonisms within his own party and, of course, with Democrats, and he was no ally of minority leader Bob Michel's. Michel, in fact, was supporting his fellow Illinoisan Edward R. Madigan, who had the traditional qualifications for the role to a T. But Gingrich once again was prepared to seize his moment. He had heard about the Cheney appointment on a Saturday, and immediately got on the telephone, rounding up support for his candidacy. He called Marianne into his office to get food and run errands, while he and his allies worked the phones late into the night. By Monday, he'd built a sizable base of support. Madigan didn't get around to announcing until Monday. Gingrich won the election by two votes, 87 to 85, put over top by some of his longtime moderate adversaries in the party. After Gingrich's victory, Wright sent him a copy of his book Reflections of a Public Man , with the inscription, ""For Newt --who likes books, too...To be chosen by your peers is a great honor."" Gingrich called the Speaker and thanked him --but had second thoughts when it occurred to him that Wright's gesture ""was meant as a publicity stunt."" The vote made clear, Michel said, that the G.O.P. members wanted a more activist leadership. As Gingrich sees it, ""The party went through a twelve-day introspection trying to decide which was the greater risk, and decided on balance it was less risky to have more risks."" Some, including Gingrich himself, believe that his new party ""insider"" status will moderate the former bomb thrower, ""I have to be more cautious now,"" he says, ""because I no longer just speak for myself."" Coelho says that in the early going he has been cooperative, helping to pass the budget through the House without obstruction. But there are also those in the G.O.P. who say that Gingrich is biding his time, that it is one thing to be conciliatory on the budget, and that when it comes to real ""wedge"" issues, those gut issues that can be used against Democrats committed to policies outside the moderate-conservative spectrum, the Gingrich strategy will be to raise hell and publicize the divisions. ""You'll see them more energized, more involved in drawing the line to show the difference between Republican and Democratic behavior,"" Vander Jagt says, ""and therefore you'll see more sharply defined confrontational votes that we can play to. One of my frustrations has been you do not change public perception by issuing press releases from the Republican National Committee. You change it by headlines that result from action under that Capitol dome and votes that are taken there."" But far more important than Gingrich's congressional role is his place in the wider campaign to win the House for the Republican Party. There is in this Republican quest a weird factor at play. Polls cited by both parties show that about half of all Americans don't perceive the House as an institution run by Democrats. When Reagan was in the White House, in fact, more people thought that it was a Republican body. Republican strategists believe, perhaps inevitably, that if voters saw the House as a Democratic monolith, they'd make the same values connection they make in presidential races and take it out on their local Democrats. That's what G.O.P. strategists believe occurred in 1980, when, with Jimmy Carter in the White House, people took for granted that the House was democratic and proceeded to go out and vote for Republican congressional candidates. So Gingrich's role is to drive home the message that the House is a Democratically controlled institution. Or, rather, that it is a ""corrupt, left-wing, Democratically controlled institution."" ""Exactly,"" Vander Jagt says, ""exactly. We don't have Jimmy Carter to help us anymore. Now we've got Newt Gingrich."" Democrats, naturally, consider that underlying premise --that Americans will vote Republican if they realize the House is Democratic-to be, in the words of Representative Anthony, ""poppycock."" Still, they do worry about losing seats when congressional districts are reapportioned before the 1992 election. (As many as twenty seats will shift to the West and South, growing Republican strongholds.) And a Gingrich-led campaign to Willie Horton the Democratic Party figures to hurt individual candidates in the South, where many Democratic congressmen already have to out-conservative the Republicans to win elections. All of this, of course, makes Newt Gingrich a more tempting target for Democrats than ever before, which is why Alexander's ethics complaint against the Georgian should have surprised no one. Democrats considered it the height of hypocrisy for Gingrich to go after Wright for his peculiar book deal when Gingrich himself had made not one but two unusual book arrangements. The first was in 1977, before he actually won his seat, when he accepted $13,000 from his supporters to write a book that he never completed. The second case, involving Gingrich's 1984 manifesto for the Conservative Opportunity Society, concerned a unique arrangement by which twenty-one ""investors"" paid $5,000 each to a limited partnership, run by Mrs. Gingrich, to raise money to promote the book. Gingrich stoutly maintains that his deal is ""fundamentally different"" from Wright's because the money given for his book by each partner was ""an investment, not a gift"" --so defined by Gingrich because each partner had a chance to reap a profit if the book became a best-seller. (It didn't.) However, Gingrich's wife didn't recruit just businessmen in forming the partnership, she recruited supporters of Gingrich's, many of them constituents, and at least fifteen of the people who have contributed to his political campaigns. Some of them have said that they had no intention of making money, they just wanted to do something for Gingrich. Gingrich has taken the assault hard, and was reportedly shaken to the point of tears when he heard that four Democratic colleagues were asking that a special outside counsel pursue the charges. He says he was ""surprised and hurt,"" and spent long, anguished hours wondering if he had in fact done something worthy of investigation. But Newt Gingrich didn't get this far by indulging in self-doubt. The next day the bomb thrower was back on the attack, accusing the Democrats of ""an amateur smear,"" and bullying the press for refusing to blithely accept his definition of an ""investment"" (House rules prohibit gifts from individuals in excess of $1,000). He played the annoyed college instructor, hectoring and ridiculing reporters. When he told Andrea Mitchell of NBC News that she was ""overreaching"" with a question, she expressed the sentiment of many in the room by snapping back, ""It's an environment you helped to create."" It's an environment that figures to get muddier. Newt Gingrich has touched off a scandal of truly historic proportion. The various investigations of Wright's personal and business conduct range far beyond Gingrich's original charges, and the ethics committee is now probing allegations of wrongdoing related to Wright's unusual good fortune in an oil well deal (his blind trust turned a nifty $292,000 profit in a month). As the revelations continue, congressional and media scrutiny of the Speaker has intensified. The Washington Post published a devastating retelling of a brutal stabbing by the man who was Wright's top aide on Capitol Hill. Though the story had been common knowledge in congressional circles, the article was the talk of Washington for several days and resulted in the aide's resignation. It gave vivid, spine-chilling details of John Paul Mack's 1973 assault on a twenty-year old customer of the Virginia store in which he was then working as a clerk. He went berserk, slashing the woman and crushing her skull with a hammer, then left her for dead. After two years in jail, Mack was released on a work program; he had been promised a job in the office of Congressman Jim Wright --whose daughter was then married to Mack's brother. The sordid allegations and news stories multiply, and it has become clear to members on both sides of the aisle that Wright is unlikely to survive as Speaker of the House. At best, he'll be allowed to resign his post and retain some shred of dignity. Furthermore, one of the likely choices to succeed him, Tony Coelho, may himself be facing an ethics-committee inquiry for failing to make required disclosures about his highly profitable purchase of a Drexel junk bond. The bottom line is that Gingrich has delivered a crushing blow to the Democratic Party, and he's prepared to escalate the battle if necessary. ""There are at least nine cases of documented Democratic scandals that by their standard would require independent counsel,"" he notes, then goes on to make what sounds very much like a threat. For the Democrats to press the case against him, Newt Gingrich warns, would be ""an act of self-immolation that is irrational."" Both Republicans and Democrats agree that this highly partisan ethics war has already inflicted heavy damage. But in the brave new political world personified by Newt Gingrich, a world in which confrontation is an end as well as a means, the bloodletting almost certainly won't stop here. more about newt . interviews . his work and writings . his reading list . a chronology",0

As the archbishop of Buenos Aires, Bergoglio had never been an especially gifted public speaker. But now that he’s Pope Francis, his recognizable humanity comes off as positively revolutionary. Against the absurd, impossibly baroque backdrop of the Vatican, a world still run like a medieval court, Francis’ election represents what his friend Elisabetta Piqué, an Argentine journalist who has known him for a decade, calls “a scandal of normality.” Since his election last March, Francis has consistently confounded expectations with the simplest of gestures: surprising desk clerks at the hotel where he’d been staying during the papal conclave by showing up to pay his own bill; panicking bodyguards by swigging from a cup of maté (the highly caffeinated tealike beverage popular throughout South America) handed to him by a stranger during a visit to Brazil; cracking up cardinals with jokes at his own expense hours after being elected (to those assembled at his first official dinner as pope, he deadpanned, “May God forgive you for what you’ve done”).",0

By eschewing the papal palace for a modest two-room apartment, by publicly scolding church leaders for being “obsessed” with divisive social issues like gay marriage, birth control and abortion (“Who am I to judge?” Francis famously replied when asked his views on homosexual priests) and – perhaps most astonishingly of all – by devoting much of his first major written teaching to a scathing critique of unchecked free-market capitalism, the pope revealed his own obsessions to be more in line with the boss’ son.",0

1496201212856840193,Newt Gingrich is demented; Cawthorn a mindless apostle.,"Alongside many noble men of God, there have been plenty of truly terrible popes, as John Julius Norwich’s history of the papacy, Absolute Monarchs, which often reads like a freaky hybrid of House of Cards and Game of Thrones, makes clear. There was Stephen VI, who exhumed the eight-month-old corpse of his predecessor, Formosus, and subjected the body, dressed in papal vestments and propped up on a throne, to a mock trial. (The corpse was found guilty and thrown into the Tiber.) Writing of the Church under Clement VI, elected in 1342, Petrarch described prostitutes “swarm[ing] on the papal beds,” adding, “I will not speak of adultery, seduction, rape, incest; these are only the prelude to their orgies.” Norwich quotes the writer Gerard Noel on Pope Innocent VIII, who “grew grossly fat and increasingly inert, being able, toward the end of his life, to take for nourishment no more than a few drops of milk from the breast of a young woman.” The loathsome, anti-Semitic Paul IV “took a special delight in the Inquisition” and managed to halve the Jewish population of Rome in five years.

In his fight against the liberalizing efforts of the Second Vatican Council, JPII, as he’s known around the Vatican, cracked down on progressive Catholic groups like the Jesuits, while welcoming controversial hypertraditionalists Opus Dei into the Church’s mainstream.

At the same time, his team responded to the endless pedophilia revelations that wracked the Church in recent decades with “denial, legalistic foot-dragging and outright obstruction,” to quote an exhaustive 2010 New York Times investigation.",0
1496201212856840193,Newt Gingrich is demented; Cawthorn a mindless apostle.,"After he became Pope Benedict in 2005, Ratzinger couldn’t seem to catch a break, and he certainly lacked the ability to apply his widely acknowledged brilliance as an academic to snuffing out fires in the real world. In 2009, a massive money-laundering scandal was uncovered at the Vatican bank, which controls about $8.2 billion in assets. Then came the betrayal known as VatiLeaks, in which Benedict’s own trusted butler stole reams of secret documents revealing embarrassing inner workings of the Holy See. The Italian press thrilled to the juiciest particulars, including allegations of a gay smear campaign, missing cash, attempted tax evasion (abetted by the Berlusconi administration), runaway spending (e.g., a $350,000 crèche) and suspicious gifts (e.g., the $100,000 worth of truffles offered to the pope by an Italian businessman).",0

Shortly after Benedict shocked the world last February by announcing he’d be the first pope to resign in more than 700 years, one final indignity followed him out the door: the disclosure in La Repubblica that Italy’s largest gay bathhouse happened to be a tenant of a building owned by the Vatican.",0

In particular, politicians. The religious right’s pact with the GOP had initially been brokered by evangelicals like Pat Robertson, historically never huge fans of their spiritual brethren in Rome. (As recently as 2011, a spokesman for the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod attempted to clarify accusations of anti-Catholic bigotry by explaining that his group “primarily views the office of the papacy as the Antichrist, not the individual popes themselves.”) But the lines have blurred. Right-wing Catholics like Newt Gingrich, Paul Ryan, Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush populate GOP presidential fields past and future, and Rick Santorum as well as Gov. Sam Brownback of Kansas have been linked to Opus Dei.",0
1496201212856840193,Newt Gingrich is demented; Cawthorn a mindless apostle.,"Open dissent, of course, is a rare thing in an organization as hierarchical as the Catholic Church. But I figured if any group would express a distinct lack of enthusiasm about their new Jesuit pope, it would be Opus Dei, and so one afternoon, I met up with Father John Paul Wauck, an American Opus Dei priest who has been living in Rome for nearly 20 years, where he teaches literature at the Pontifical University of the Holy Cross. Before taking his vows, he worked as a political speechwriter for William Barr, the attorney general under George H.W. Bush, and Gov. Robert Casey of Pennsylvania, whom Wauck describes as “the last of the big pro-life Democrats.” A trim, cheery 50-year-old who grew up in the same Chicago suburb as Hillary Clinton, Wauck displays a Midwestern eagerness to please as he leads me on a tour of Holy Cross. Up on the roof, which provides a panoramic view of Rome, he points out a villa where Galileo was imprisoned by the Church during his Inquisition for promoting the dangerous idea that the Earth revolves around the sun. Downstairs, we duck into an 18th-century chapel where, Wauck says, Mozart played as a boy. Wauck directs my eye to a painting of Aloysius Gonzaga, the great Jesuit saint. At Gonzaga’s feet, a fat cherub holds a tiny spiked whip. “Corporal mortification used to be universal!” Wauck says. “Until fairly recently, pretty much all religious orders did it. Mother Teresa’s nuns still do. It’s not something unique to Opus Dei. We just didn’t abandon it.”",0
1496201212856840193,Newt Gingrich is demented; Cawthorn a mindless apostle.,"Wauck, who does not seem all that conservative for a member of Opus Dei – at one point, he asks excitedly if I’ve read Eminent Hipsters, the new memoir by Donald Fagen of Steely Dan – nonetheless downplays the pope’s call for a truce in the culture wars. “I certainly have no problem at all with anything the pope says,” he tells me. “I do think there has been a bit of selective reading. People are emphasizing certain things and forgetting other things that he also said.” For instance, Wauck points out that the pope often speaks about the devil, “much more than I ever remember Benedict doing.” Likewise, he notes that Francis’ comments about the church’s obsession with gay marriage and abortion did not propose any real doctrinal changes. “The pope never said those issues weren’t important,” Wauck says. “He said that when we talk about these things, we have to talk about them in a context. And who would disagree with that? So when people are trying to figure out what kind of guy is this, you have to hear all the bells, not just the ones that sound like, ‘Oh, he’s going to change everything.'”",0
1496201212856840193,Newt Gingrich is demented; Cawthorn a mindless apostle.,"This is a common retort among conservative Catholics about Pope Francis: You guys in the secular liberal media just aren’t listening. Santorum has insisted the pope’s comments on gays and abortion were taken out of context. New York Cardinal Timothy Dolan, a conservative who had made a number of papal long lists in March, also wasted no time in translating Francis’ message, telling CBS This Morning, “Pope Francis would be the first to say, ‘My job isn’t to change church teaching. My job is to present it as clearly as possible. . . . While certain acts may be wrong . . . we will always love and respect the person and treat the person with dignity.'”",0
1496201212856840193,Newt Gingrich is demented; Cawthorn a mindless apostle.,"While much of this sounds like wishful thinking, they also have a point: The pope’s tonal changes don’t necessarily signal a wild swing from tradition. Francis has ruled out the ordination of women, for example, and he still considers abortion an evil. But those obsessed with contextualizing Francis would do well to take a look at the impromptu press conference he granted last summer to gathered Vaticanisti (members of the Vatican press corps) during the flight back from a trip to Rio. Father Federico Lombardi, director of the Vatican press office, told me he’d expected the press conference would go about 20 minutes. It lasted for nearly 90, and ended up including the pope’s famous “Who am I to judge?” response, which is normally the only part of the exchange that’s quoted. But reading the full transcript or, better yet, watching longer excerpts on YouTube helps to convey the true context.",0
1496201212856840193,Newt Gingrich is demented; Cawthorn a mindless apostle.,"A reporter asks Francis, who is standing at the head of the aisle, about the existence of a “gay lobby” within the Vatican. Francis begins by making a joke, saying he hasn’t yet run into anyone with a special gay identification card. But then his face becomes serious and, gesturing for emphasis, he says it’s important to distinguish between lobbies, which are bad – “A lobby of the greedy, a lobby of politicians, a lobby of Masons, so many lobbies!” he says later in the press conference – and individual gay people who are well-intentioned and seeking God. It’s while speaking to the latter point that he makes the “Who am I to judge?” remark, and this part of the video is really worth watching, because, aside from the entirely mind-blowing fact of a supposedly infallible pope asking this question at all, his answer is never really translated properly. What he actually says is, “Mah, who am I to judge?” In Italian, mah is an interjection with no exact English parallel, sort of the verbal equivalent of an emphatic shrug. My dad’s use of mah most often precedes his resignedly pouring another splash of grappa into his coffee. The closest translation I can come up with is “Look, who the hell knows?” If you watch the video, Francis even pinches his fingers together for extra Italian emphasis. Then he flashes a knowing smirk.",0
1496201212856840193,Newt Gingrich is demented; Cawthorn a mindless apostle.,"Father Thomas J. Reese, a senior analyst at the left-leaning National Catholic Reporter, says the arguments about style versus substance when it comes to Pope Francis are missing the point entirely. “In the Catholic Church, style is substance,” Reese says. “We are a church of symbols. That’s what we call the sacrament: symbols that give us grace. These things really matter. So Francis is already changing the church in real ways through his words and symbolic gestures. He could sit in his office, go through canon law and start changing rules and regulations. But that’s not what people want him to do.”",0
1496201212856840193,Newt Gingrich is demented; Cawthorn a mindless apostle.,"Reese, who is 68, used to be editor in chief of America, the Jesuit magazine that published a long interview with Pope Francis in the fall. Reese was forced to resign in 2005 after the Vatican – specifically, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, just before he became Pope Benedict – repeatedly complained about articles challenging church orthodoxy on issues like stem cell research, gay marriage and ecumenicalism. “I was Ratzinger’s last victim,” Reese jokes. The election of Francis took him completely by surprise. He hadn’t expected to see another pope who created such hope for the church.",0
1496201212856840193,Newt Gingrich is demented; Cawthorn a mindless apostle.,"“The problem with the last two popes is they were academics at heart,” Reese says. “Both had taught at universities where students write down everything you say, go home, memorize it and give it back on an exam. The European educational system is even worse that way than the U.S. The word ‘magisterial’ comes from magister, ‘the teacher,’ and that was their attitude.”",0
1496201212856840193,Newt Gingrich is demented; Cawthorn a mindless apostle.,"For Reese, this pedagogical obsession, which he traces back to “Martin Luther, a brilliant theologian, leading everyone astray as far as the Church is concerned,” gets to the heart of what’s driving conservatives crazy about the loose-speaking ways of the new pope. “You’ve heard the phrase about generals fighting the last war?” Reese asks. “Well, the Church has been doing that for centuries. We’re still fighting the Reformation!”",0
1496201212856840193,Newt Gingrich is demented; Cawthorn a mindless apostle.,"Thus far, Francis’ humble lifestyle decisions as pope – riding around town in a Ford Focus instead of a chauffeured Mercedes limo, for example – have been terrific and all, but the hosannas directed his way can feel a bit like he’s being graded on a curve. Yes, obviously you shouldn’t live in an insane palace if you’re the head of a religion based on principles of charity and compassion and founded by a homeless proto-hippie. But Francis threw down a real marker in November, with the release of his first apostolic exhortation, or official written teaching. Apostolic exhortations under John Paul II and Benedict tended toward the dogmatic (JPII’s Familiaris Consortio restated orthodox Church teaching on birth control and the traditional family) or the wonky (Benedict’s Sacramentum Caritatis spent 32,000 words on the Eucharist). In this context, the blistering attacks on income inequality in Francis’ Evangelii Gaudium (“The Joy of the Gospel”) resonate like a bomb.",0
1496201212856840193,Newt Gingrich is demented; Cawthorn a mindless apostle.,"He describes a “culture of prosperity” that “deadens us” to the misery of the poor: “All those lives stunted for lack of opportunity seem a mere spectacle; they fail to move us.” Debt, corruption, tax evasion, mass layoffs (“attempting to increase profits by reducing the workforce and thereby adding to the ranks of the excluded”) and environmental degradation all come under attack. Some people, Francis wrote, “continue to defend trickle-down theories,” a belief that “has never been confirmed by the facts” and one that “expresses a crude and naive trust in the goodness of those wielding economic power. . . . Meanwhile, the excluded are still waiting.”",0
1496201212856840193,Newt Gingrich is demented; Cawthorn a mindless apostle.,"It’s one thing to question God’s will when it comes to sexual morality, but for American conservatives, taking on the sacred economic doctrines of Ronald Reagan is a mortal sin. Sarah Palin told CNN some of the pope’s statements have “taken me aback” and sounded “kind of liberal.” (She later apologized for even such a mild rebuke.) Rush Limbaugh was less circumspect, calling the pope’s message “pure Marxism.” Ken Langone, the billionaire Home Depot co-founder and would-be Republican kingmaker, told Cardinal Dolan that a multimillion-dollar restoration of St. Patrick’s Cathedral might run into funding difficulties if wealthy Catholics keep getting their feelings hurt by “exclusionary” papal remarks.",0
1496201212856840193,Newt Gingrich is demented; Cawthorn a mindless apostle.,"And yet, in a stroke of what one might be tempted to call divine justice, the GOP, having played the God card so shamelessly for so many years, finds itself largely powerless to rebut the most prominent critic of income inequality on the planet. Paul Ryan, the architect of a budget proposal so regressive he drew the ire of a group of nuns, explained away Francis’ analysis by saying the pope never experienced “real capitalism” in Argentina. (Shantytowns are bad and all, but come on: Has His Holiness been apprised of the employer mandates in Obamacare?) Newt Gingrich, on the other hand, seems to see the writing on the wall, telling The New York Times, “I think the pope may, in fact, be starting a conversation at the exact moment the Republican Party itself needs to have that conversation.”",0
1496201212856840193,Newt Gingrich is demented; Cawthorn a mindless apostle.,"The reaction on the other side of the spectrum has been less complicated. “Pope Francis is a gift from heaven, a prophetic voice willing to be a critic of capitalism and imperialism,” says Cornel West, long a leading voice on the Christian left. “I don’t want to fetishize the pope. He heads a deeply patriarchal and homophobic organization that I’m critical of. But I love who he is, in terms of what he says, and the impact of his words on progressive forces around the world.”",0
1496201212856840193,Newt Gingrich is demented; Cawthorn a mindless apostle.,"Bergoglio was born in Buenos Aires, but his parents were Italian; his father fled Italy when Mussolini came to power. The family settled in Flores, a leafy, solidly middle-class neighborhood. There were many Italian relatives around, including a great-uncle whom Bergoglio described in a 2010 book of interviews as a “rascally old man” who “taught us to sing some rather risqué ditties in Genoese dialect. That explains why the only things I can say in Genoese do not bear repeating.”",0

1496201212856840193,Newt Gingrich is demented; Cawthorn a mindless apostle.,"Bergoglio studied chemistry at a technical school, worked in a laboratory, moonlighted as a bouncer at a Buenos Aires bar, loved soccer and dancing the tango. Then, at 17, while meeting some friends, he walked past a church and had an epiphany. In an interview with a Buenos Aires radio station, Bergoglio described feeling “like somebody grabbed me from inside and took me to the confessional. . . . While I was there I felt that I had to become a priest, and I didn’t doubt it.”",0
1496201212856840193,Newt Gingrich is demented; Cawthorn a mindless apostle.,"Bergoglio didn’t tell anyone about this incident for the next four years, while he continued to work and go to school, but in 1958, at age 21, he entered a Jesuit seminary. His mother was unhappy with his decision, and for years refused to visit him. “My mother experienced it as a plundering,” Bergoglio recalled. “‘I don’t know, I don’t see you as . . . you should wait a bit. . . . You’re the eldest. . . . Keep working. . . . Finish university,’ she said. The truth is, my mother was extremely upset.” Bergoglio later said he was drawn to the Jesuits because of their emphasis on obedience and discipline, and also because he hoped to work as a missionary in Japan, where the Jesuits had been the first to introduce Christianity in the 1540s, though health problems – he’d lost part of a lung after a bout with pneumonia – prevented him from such travel. Instead, he taught literature at a Jesuit school, bringing in the great Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges for a lecture and, eventually, at the age of 36, found himself appointed provincial superior of the Jesuits in Argentina, which meant he oversaw the activities of the religious order throughout the country. “That was crazy,” the pope acknowledged in his interview in America. “I had to deal with difficult situations, and I made my decisions abruptly and by myself.” According to Paul Vallely’s biography Pope Francis, Untying the Knots, Bergoglio was a divisive figure, seen by some Argentine Jesuits, ironically enough, as a conservative throwback clinging to pre-Vatican II tradition. Bergoglio used the word “authoritarianism” to describe his leadership style back then, admitting, “I did not always do the necessary consultation. . . . My style of government as a Jesuit at the beginning had many faults.”",0
1496201212856840193,Newt Gingrich is demented; Cawthorn a mindless apostle.,"Bergoglio’s term as provincial superior coincided with one of the most traumatic eras in his country’s history, the so-called Dirty War that tore Argentina apart in the wake of a 1976 military coup. For the next seven years, the country was ruled by a right-wing dictatorship; death squads terrorized the nation as tens of thousands of civilians were “disappeared.” The junta was outwardly Catholic, and many church leaders openly collaborated. One of the few Argentine bishops to speak out against the government was murdered in a faked car accident.",0
1496201212856840193,Newt Gingrich is demented; Cawthorn a mindless apostle.,"If there is anything close to a stain on Bergoglio’s record, it’s his behavior during this period. As a provincial superior, he had far less power or stature than a bishop, and public denunciations of the junta would have likely gotten him killed. Defenders argue that he worked effectively behind the scenes, risking his own life by disguising hundreds of targeted civilians as seminarians and sneaking them out of the country. But critics believe he was complicit in the arrest and torture of a pair of activist Jesuits with whom he’d been feuding. Bergoglio has strongly denied the charge, insisting that he immediately “set the ball rolling” to orchestrate their release, but one of the priests, Orlando Yorio, wrote a book claiming Bergoglio had been the one who tipped off the junta. Yorio died in 2000. The other priest, Francisco Jalics, refutes Yorio’s account; in October, he met with the pope in Rome, and they had previously celebrated Mass together. Elisabetta Piqué, who has spent much of her career as a journalist covering wars, believes Jalics, dismissing the controversy as “totally fake, as we know now. Bergoglio has a clear conscience. He’s at peace with himself. He did whatever he could.”",0
1496201212856840193,Newt Gingrich is demented; Cawthorn a mindless apostle.,"At the same time, liberation theology was spreading throughout Latin America. Its Marxist focus on the class struggle and open calls for revolution – some priests actually took up arms and joined groups like the Sandinistas – petrified Catholic traditionalists. John Paul II’s Vatican denounced liberation theology as heresy and all but smothered it (clandestinely abetted, in many countries, by the CIA). In Vallely’s telling, Bergoglio was also hostile to the movement during the Dirty War, even though the spirit of liberation theology has clearly influenced his own papacy, most markedly in the language of Evangelii Gaudium. He may have been responding to pressure from Rome in obedient Jesuit fashion; he also clearly worried that overtly radical activity by any of his priests could make the entire order a target of the junta. Whatever his true feelings back then, as pope, Francis has made his sympathies clear: Last September, he invited the Peruvian founder of the movement, Father Gustavo Gutiérrez, to visit him at the Vatican.",0
1496201212856840193,Newt Gingrich is demented; Cawthorn a mindless apostle.,"Bergoglio’s self-described “authoritarian” reign ended in banishment. After his stint as provincial, his new Jesuit superiors received so many complaints about his difficult personality that he was eventually assigned to a new post in Córdoba, 400 miles away. There, Vallely writes, he “brooded,” feeling “sidelined and belittled.” The colleagues he’d alienated could barely recognize him when he returned to the capital in 1992. The chastening had forced Bergoglio to mature, mellow, open his mind. Six years later, in 1998, he became archbishop of Buenos Aires. Foreshadowing his behavior as pope, he rejected many of the princely trappings of his new office, getting around town via bus, residing in a simple apartment and cooking his own meals on weekends. An interviewer once asked if he was a good cook, to which Bergoglio responded, “Well, no one ever died.” He would ask friends to tape CDs for him, because all he had was a cassette player.",0
1496201212856840193,Newt Gingrich is demented; Cawthorn a mindless apostle.,"Much of his attention was focused on the dispossessed: He wandered the city’s worst neighborhoods, kissed the feet of AIDS patients in a hospice, heard confessions from prostitutes on park benches, disguised himself in a poncho to march in a slum procession, stood up to drug dealers who threatened one of his priests. Piqué’s husband, Gerry O’Connell, also a journalist, who covers the Vatican for La Stampa, recalls visiting the archbishop’s palatial residence shortly after Bergoglio took office. The “grand meeting room,” where previous archbishops had received visitors, was now stuffed with boxes of clothes and food for the poor. “It was amazing – he’d turned it into a storeroom!” O’Connell says.",0
1496201212856840193,Newt Gingrich is demented; Cawthorn a mindless apostle.,"Bergoglio’s ascension to the top of the Argentine church coincided with a national crisis that would leave indelible marks on his thinking: The year he took office, Argentina’s economy plunged into a brutal recession, a situation that worsened when the International Monetary Fund pressured the government to undertake harsh austerity measures. More than half of the population fell into poverty, bringing a level of misery unfathomable in the United States. Riots broke out; paco, a cracklike drug made from cheap cocaine residue and additives like sulfuric acid, rat poison and kerosene, swept the shantytowns. Things began to turn around in 2003, when the country decided to default on its debts to the IMF, which, to the anti-globalization left, had come to be seen as a thuggish loan shark undermining the sovereignty of the developing world. It was a move that surely did not go unnoticed by Bergoglio, who, in Evangelii Gaudium, lashes out at “ideologies which defend the absolute autonomy of the marketplace . . . reject[ing] the right of states . . . to exercise any form of control” and calls the deification of the free market “a new tyranny . . . which unilaterally and relentlessly imposes its own laws and rules.”",0
1496201212856840193,Newt Gingrich is demented; Cawthorn a mindless apostle.,"A slapping-around by the forces of global capitalism tends to focus the mind, even one preoccupied with the mystical. You can see how “obsessing” over gay marriage and birth control might begin to feel like a first-world problem. Though still outwardly orthodox, Bergoglio joked to a friend about church leaders who “want to stick the whole world inside a condom.” He also made enemies of Argentine president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner and her late husband (and predecessor), Néstor Kirchner, embarrassing them with denunciations of feeble poverty initiatives and unbridled corruption. One of the U.S. diplomatic cables released in the WikiLeaks dump described Bergoglio as a “leader of the opposition”; when news broke that Bergoglio had been elected pope, Kirchner allies in Congress passed on a tribute in favor of testimonials devoted to the late Hugo Chávez.",0

Bergoglio, behind the scenes, pushed a compromise involving civil unions, but failed to win over conservative bishops. A private letter he wrote describing gay marriage as “the total rejection of the law of God” leaked, bruising his image, though Vallely argues he wrote the letter as a strategic means of currying favor with the conservatives. Marcelo Márquez, a gay-rights leader in Buenos Aires, delivered Bergoglio an angry note – and received a call an hour later. “He listened to my views with a great deal of respect,” Márquez told The New York Times. They met on two occasions. Márquez told the future pope about his marriage plans, and departed with a gift: a copy of Bergoglio’s biography.",0

It seems unlikely that the job of pope was something Bergoglio sought or had even mentally prepared for. He later remarked, in a leaked private speech, that he’d come to Rome “only with the necessary clothes. . . . I did not have any chance! In the London betting houses I was in 44th place.

2) Newt did not know where to drop the line.  Newt shut government funding down. He later admitted he made this dangerous precedent due to personal pique -- he was insulted by being ignored while on a flight with the President.

There has been a renaissance of sorts when it comes to women becoming empowered against their treatment both in the workforce and in their private lives, and they have built up the courage en masse to come forward with how they have been treated by their peers and superiors. While a great step in the right direction, there have been bad actors that have unfortunately taken this movement for personal gain and have “come forward” with accusations of rape and sexual misconduct that were later discovered to have been completely made up. This combined with the tailwind on the movement flagging somewhat has resulted in some mental pushback against the idea that “you should just trust women about these things”, and in the minds of some this has gone full circle to “women are just seeking attention”.",0

1453715004323254273,bill cosby is a sexual predator lol,"%3E In evaluating the likelihood of a successful prosecution of Cosby, the district attorney foresaw difficulties with Constand’s credibility as a witness based, in part, upon her decision not to file a complaint promptly. D.A. Castor further determined that a prosecution would be frustrated because there was no corroborating forensic evidence and because testimony from other potential claimants against Cosby likely was inadmissible under governing laws of evidence.
Now, in most countries, it isn’t even permissible to mention accused previous convictions in criminal trial, never mind unproven accusations which alleged to have happened for different occasions. Guilty verdict should be built on evidence about the fact of the crime the accused is charged with, and not based on personal profile and impression of the accused. “The guy is “rapey” enough, so he is guilty”, or “6 accusation so at least some of the allegations must be true. Let just convict him on the one he just happened to be charged with.” is not how a civilised society should reach a guilty verdict.",0
1453715004323254273,bill cosby is a sexual predator lol,"Yet, the prosecutor brought in, and the trial judge permitted 5 additional alleged victims who all testified that they were raped by Cosby.

The fact that both of them are elected so need to deliver verdict their electorates want is probably a factor here.",0
1453715004323254273,bill cosby is a sexual predator lol,"3. The accuser, Andrea Constand, has a serious issue of credibility.

Cosby didn’t just got off on technicality. Had the trial being fair, Cosby probably got not-guilty verdict. The trial was travesty, so the Pen Supreme Court had to step in.",0

1453715004323254273,bill cosby is a sexual predator lol,"I think the biggest problem is that, in the US, it doesn’t provide anonymity to the accused. In many other countries, they do provide anonymity at least until the conclusion of the criminal trial. And only in case of a guilty verdict the case can be publicised. This is partly because damage of accusation alone is often irreparable even after a not-guilty verdict. But also, anonymity is there to prevent copy-cat (or call it malicious me-too) accusations, especially when an account of rape accusation get widely reported.",0
1453715004323254273,bill cosby is a sexual predator lol,"The problem is compounded in the US because US civil litigation use punitive damage where you are likely to make a mint if you accuse rich person instead of penniless person, even though the damage suffer from wrongdoing would be the same. This create perverse incentive. The fact that every accusers of Cosby can expect substantial monetary compensation taint the entire accusations. Yes it is unfair if the accuser is genuine victim but so is the case for innocent person being maliciously accused for profit. This is what you get when you incentivise accusers to take the matter to the court of public opinion, then, in case of Cosby, bend all sort of rules including constitution to get what activists and pitchfork crowd want.",0
1453715004323254273,bill cosby is a sexual predator lol,"Yes, “believe women” is fine for the police. The police’s job is to investigate suspect so certain bias in favour of the accuser and bias against accused/suspect is expected and even beneficial. If the police have a multiple accusations of rape or domestic abuse, that is a probable cause for further investigation, and not “there isn’t anything we can do” which was a norm in the previous century.",0
1453715004323254273,bill cosby is a sexual predator lol,"But this doesn’t mean the standard of due process should be lowered. Introducing “believe women” into criminal trial like it happened in the Cosby trial is not a progress. It is in fact regression to bad old days. In addition, when the accuser take the accusation to the media, that accusation should face public scrutiny just as a matter of fairness to the one being accused. There is an overwhelming attitude in the public that question these women is something morally wrong, and public should “believe women”. That is a group think of the worst kind. I would rather prefer that the public and journalist scrutinise these accusations so good (accusations) can be separated from bad. And in Cosby case at least large portion seems bad, just that, whether all of is bad, or just one good one at least is unknowable at the moment. For the accusations against the nomination of Kavanaugh that what happened. All accusations against him bar Ford’s seem to be motivated by publicity seeking, and Ford’s accusations faced scrutiny. That was a good thing. As things stand for Cosby, accusations are accepted so uncritically that none can be said to to stand up under scrutiny. And I’m shocked that not just the court of public opinion but the actual trial essentially went down the route of trial by mob.",0
1453715004323254273,bill cosby is a sexual predator lol,"5. The last unmentionable is the fact that Cosby is black. The US has an ugly history of black men being killed by mob, sometimes when they were just accused of whistling to a white woman. It is all fairness and equality in normal circumstances. But once there are some sort of excuses for it, it is back to bad old days where “This got nothing to do with his race but,,,” Manufactured falsehood about “Cosby admitted rape” to blatant disregard to due process of law, it isn’t far fetched to say there was an orchestrated conspiracy against him.",0

1453715004323254273,bill cosby is a sexual predator lol,"Bill Cosby admitted he drugged those women. He admitted he administered drugs to them so he could have sex with them , which was consensual in his mind because they didn’t resist. The reason they didn’t resist however was because they were unable to because they were heavily sedated. Andrea Constand is openly gay. Obvioulsy, she was not interested in having sex with him!!! In addition, she was 30 and he was 66. In addition, in 2005 she sued him for money and she was paid 3.8 million $ for damages. However, she pursued a criminal trial, so she would see him behind bars because money doesn’t make everything ok. If she lied and only wanted money she wouldn’t have pressed charges, she had already taken money and Cosby could not settle a criminal trial out of court, noone can, so there was no more money for Constand!!! It was about justice!!! In addition, even if some of the 67 women who have accused him so far are indeed liars and opportunists and are probably lying for money, not all 67 women are lying!!!! Also, they have all described a very similar pattern which he used to sedate them and then have sex with them, which is not consensual, thus it is rape. Predators do indeed have multiple victims, like Harvey Weinstein , who has been accused by 90 women so far, if not more and most of the time act in a certain way. I do believe he is guilty. What i don’t understand though is why some women kept in touch with him even after he raped them. He raped Lili Bernard twice. Then, she accepted a minor part at the Cosby show. How could she work with him if he had raped her? But i do believe he did rape her.",0
1453715004323254273,bill cosby is a sexual predator lol,"I think he is guilty, and the court agrees. He was in the perfect position of fame and power that seduces many men to abuse their power. What I still find maddening is that it took the testimony of 67 women to outweigh the testimony of one man, and it took multiple trials. At some point, America has to come to terms with the fact that seemingly very nice, wonderful men can be sexual abusers. Fame and fortune should not give people immunity to the law. The usual excuse of ""She's just doing it for the money, or she just hates republicans/democrats"", or whatever is the popular excuse at the time is nothing but an attempt to shut the victim up. How victims of sexual assault are treated by our justice system is a tragedy, and it contributes to women not reporting it. There is no motivation for these women to lie, they usually end up slandered, threatened and incapable of getting justice anyway. There is every motivation for the perpetrator to lie.",0

comedian that did a show on stage, I don’t even remember where. He got talking
about Bill Cosby and making fun of the fact that he had been accused of raping

1453715004323254273,bill cosby is a sexual predator lol,"Question: How likely is it that Bill Cosby will spend even a single night behind bars, whether he is sentenced to prison or not?",0
1453715004323254273,bill cosby is a sexual predator lol,Subjective opinion (Based upon similar cases): Not very likely at all.,0
1453715004323254273,bill cosby is a sexual predator lol,Why?,0
1453715004323254273,bill cosby is a sexual predator lol,"1. He’s worth $500 million - Not drug money; REAL MONEY. That means that he could conceivably bankroll a series of appeals that could set legal precedents in the United States. He can employ the titans of the criminal defense world; and he could do so for a relatively tiny fraction of his total net worth. That will keep him out of jail for the next 3–5 years until he has exhausted his appeals…if he doesn’t prevail during his retrial.
2. He’s 80 years old - While a man of his wealth could theoretically live for another decade or so, it’s likely that the strains of his legal troubles have taken their toll upon Cosby and his health. The recent death of his daughter couldn’t have helped, and he is likely suffering some measure of depression from his hard-earned public legacy crumbling around him. Not knowing the state of his health personally, it would still be difficult to imagine that a healthy man would want to spend his 80s and 90s in a prison cell, much less one who has endured the rigors (self-generated, of course) that Cosby has.
3. He’s Bill Cosby - While the prosecutor made the perfunctory request that his bail be revoked and that Cosby be sent to prison immediately, the cold reality of the matter is that no prison wants Bill Cosby as an inmate. Not only would he present a major security headache (after all, there are racists and losers who in attempting to make a name, who would try to harm him), the curiosity factor would mean an increased strain on security. Additionally, Cosby, being a wealthy man, means that ANY mistakes or failures on the part of the correctional staff mean that his army of attorneys can bury the prison system in legal filings. The longer that Bill Cosby stays out of prison, the “happier” the prison system will be.
4. He’s Bill Cosby #2 - While the entertainment community and the majority of the Black community have largely remained on the sidelines during Bill Cosby’s trials, that won’t be the case if he ends up in prison. Important people will be concerned with his safety, and that will put extreme amounts of pressure on the prison system. Additionally, while the American Black community has not viewed his trial as being a racial issue, if or when Cosby entered the prison system, they WOULD view his treatment there as potentially being one. Few bureaucrats want (or need) world famous celebrities disparaging them and their institutions in the media as that is certainly a means to their careers ending.
5. It serves little purpose - Bill Cosby is 80. He won’t be “reformed” by a prison stay at the end of his life. He won’t be “punished” to any significant degree, as his wealth and fame will insulate him from the worst of that. He’s already been disgraced by the entire proceeding and his public stature being reduced. Even he lives for another decade or so after he might be incarcerated, he certainly won’t be spending it in prison as health concerns and the costs defend the system against the litigation that his family will file, would strain an already tenuous budget even further. And finally, his incarceration won’t be a deterrent to anyone. Basically, sending him to prison might satisfy his victim and others who claim that he also victimized them. However, their wants and needs aren’t serious metrics that would be used in any determinations concerning his imprisonment.
When you look at the matter pragmatically, Bill Cosby was tried and sentenced at least 15–20 years too late for his incarceration to be a certainty. At 80 years of age, he would have likely have only 5–15 years left to live, with most of that time suffering from a variety of illnesses and ailments. He would need to be held in a prison hospital ward, under heavy guard, and his security at whatever institution that houses him would paramount. His stay would also be scrutinized by his wealthy (and potentially litigious) family as well as a media and celebrities who would be concerned about his condition.",0
1453715004323254273,bill cosby is a sexual predator lol,"Assuming that he survives until his appeals run out and he is eventually imprisoned, it would likely be for a few months or perhaps 1–2 years at most. A judge would have to take that into consideration during sentencing and they would likely hand down a term that reflects the ugly realities of matter. I certainly don’t see him spending a decade (or even a large fraction of one) in prison, if he does any time at all.",0

1453715004323254273,bill cosby is a sexual predator lol,"1. Prisons are overcrowded - While it sounds trite, there are actually people waiting for their “opening” in prison, and so the system only works when nonviolent or less violent felons are released early or in a timely manner.
2. It’s cheaper to keep a portion of the felon population out of jail on probation or a in halfway house - Again, prisons are overcrowded and it’s cheaper and often easier to let first time offenders spend a portion (or even all) of their sentence in some type of monitored or suspended confinement outside of a penal setting.
3. Prisons give “good time” credits to encourage good behavior and reduce their overcrowding - Basically, inmates are provided with points that can be used to reduce the length of their sentence. These are only withdrawn for serious violations of prison rules as doing so at a whim risks devaluing the entire process.
4. Most first time felons receive the lower ends of their sentence, especially for nonviolent or less violent crimes - While Bill Cosby sex-based offenses are egregious, they are vastly overshadowed by what many offenders are imprisoned for having committed. Since he’s a first time offender, he almost would have to serve the lower range of his sentence or, at worst, something closer to 50%.

1453715004323254273,bill cosby is a sexual predator lol,"1. He’s worth $500 million - Not drug money; REAL MONEY. That means that he could conceivably bankroll a series of appeals that could set legal precedents in the United States. He can employ the titans of the criminal defense world; and he could do so for a relatively tiny fraction of his total net worth. That will keep him out of jail for the next 3–5 years until he has exhausted his appeals…if he doesn’t prevail during his retrial.
2. He’s 80 years old - While a man of his wealth could theoretically live for another decade or so, it’s likely that the strains of his legal troubles have taken their toll upon Cosby and his health. The recent death of his daughter couldn’t have helped, and he is likely suffering some measure of depression from his hard-earned public legacy crumbling around him. Not knowing the state of his health personally, it would still be difficult to imagine that a healthy man would want to spend his 80s and 90s in a prison cell, much less one who has endured the rigors (self-generated, of course) that Cosby has.
3. He’s Bill Cosby - While the prosecutor made the perfunctory request that his bail be revoked and that Cosby be sent to prison immediately, the cold reality of the matter is that no prison wants Bill Cosby as an inmate. Not only would he present a major security headache (after all, there are racists and losers who in attempting to make a name, who would try to harm him), the curiosity factor would mean an increased strain on security. Additionally, Cosby, being a wealthy man, means that ANY mistakes or failures on the part of the correctional staff mean that his army of attorneys can bury the prison system in legal filings. The longer that Bill Cosby stays out of prison, the “happier” the prison system will be.
4. He’s Bill Cosby #2 - While the entertainment community and the majority of the Black community have largely remained on the sidelines during Bill Cosby’s trials, that won’t be the case if he ends up in prison. Important people will be concerned with his safety, and that will put extreme amounts of pressure on the prison system. Additionally, while the American Black community has not viewed his trial as being a racial issue, if or when Cosby entered the prison system, they WOULD view his treatment there as potentially being one. Few bureaucrats want (or need) world famous celebrities disparaging them and their institutions in the media as that is certainly a means to their careers ending.
5. It serves little purpose - Bill Cosby is 80. He won’t be “reformed” by a prison stay at the end of his life. He won’t be “punished” to any significant degree, as his wealth and fame will insulate him from the worst of that. He’s already been disgraced by the entire proceeding and his public stature being reduced. Even he lives for another decade or so after he might be incarcerated, he certainly won’t be spending it in prison as health concerns and the costs defend the system against the litigation that his family will file, would strain an already tenuous budget even further. And finally, his incarceration won’t be a deterrent to anyone. Basically, sending him to prison might satisfy his victim and others who claim that he also victimized them. However, their wants and needs aren’t serious metrics that would be used in any determinations concerning his imprisonment.
When you look at the matter pragmatically, Bill Cosby was tried and sentenced at least 15–20 years too late for his incarceration to be a certainty. At 80 years of age, he would have likely have only 5–15 years left to live, with most of that time suffering from a variety of illnesses and ailments. He would need to be held in a prison hospital ward, under heavy guard, and his security at whatever institution that houses him would paramount. His stay would also be scrutinized by his wealthy (and potentially litigious) family as well as a media and celebrities who would be concerned about his condition.",0

1453715004323254273,bill cosby is a sexual predator lol,"Several things have occurred which (or may not) have caused him to take a somewhat lower public profile:
1. Cosby's only son, Ennis was murdered in a bizarre random attack in Los Angeles in 1997. Cosby has rarely spoken about this situation nor has it been given much attention considering the high profile of its victim and his family.

In 2004, Cosby settled a lawsuit brought against where a woman claimed that he gave her some sleeping pills and sexually assaulted her while she was unconscious. While Cosby claims that the incident didn't occur, he rather quickly settled the lawsuit and refuses to publicly discuss the matter.
3. In 1997, at the same time Cosby's son was killed, a woman named Autumn Jackson was arrested and accused of attempting to extort money from Cosby by claiming that she was his daughter. Although Cosby claims to have taken a DNA test, the results were never released and Jackson was convicted and sentenced to five years in prison. She was released and has since disappeared from the public spotlight. The matter has never been publicly resolved.
4. Cosby engaged in several public events where he severely criticized the African American community for what he perceived to be personal and moral failings. The responses to Cosby's statements were mixed and he discontinued making similar statements in the few public appearances he has made since that time.",0

His Fox News talk show is known not so much for considering the viewpoints of its guests (be they live or featured via clips in the public domain) as drawing targets on them for thousands of angry viewers to act upon. He also, perhaps unsurprisingly, considers himself a victim of “the mob.” About a decade ago, so the world learned thanks to audio clips excavated in early 2019, Carlson expressed a number of opinions during regular appearances on a radio show, including: “Iraq is a crappy place filled with a bunch of, you know, semiliterate primitive monkeys” who should “shut up and obey” Americans; white men deserve credit for “creating civilization”; women are “extremely primitive”; and, of seventeen-year-old beauty pageant contestant Caitlin Upton (who was, by her account, driven almost to suicide by this humiliation), that he “was thinking about tapping my foot next to her stall” because “she’s so dumb, she’s vulnerable, she’s like a wounded gazelle, separated from the herd.”",0

I’m in that demographic, yet, as of June 2019, I knew just a handful of things about Carlson: that he is a white nationalist, self-styled populist maverick, and Republican Party millionaire whose “red-brown” talking points (brown as in “brownshirts”) have won him the time of day from far too many leftists.",0

For instance, in his Ship of Fools: How a Selfish Ruling Class Is Bringing America to the Brink of Revolution (a putrid pile of veiled anti-Semitism and xenophobia for which Simon & Schuster, incidentally, paid $10 million), one can find the following perfectly correct statements: “The earliest feminists saw nothing virtuous about [abortion]. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, one of the first suffragettes, called abortion the ‘murder of children.’ Susan B. Anthony referred to it as ‘infanticide.’” Carlson privileges, in other words, some of the same information that I do in my published critiques of (historic and actual) white feminism—only with opposite intent and opposite conclusions.",0

I am not interested in where a human life starts to exist.” From his point of view, this quote—which, by the way, I stand by entirely—is the ultimate “gotcha”; proof positive of whither feminism was always tending despite its more respectable nineteenth-century proponents’ concerns.

But privately I still feel, for my part, like it’s a pretty fair cop. I hate all manner of things in this world, and people, too—though mainly things people do. To be honest, it hadn’t even occurred to me to feel embarrassed about this hatred.

For conservatives, liberals, and socialists alike, hate itself is the thing to reject, uproot, defeat, and cast out of the soul. Yet anti-hate ideology doesn’t seem to involve targeting its root causes and points of production, nor does it address the inevitability of or the demand—the need—for hate in a class society.

It means seeking to undo the harms: to practice, instead, love and solidarity. Capitalist social relations are not purely and altogether outside of ourselves.

That the best path for me, should hating on my person ever recur at scale, is to deploy, to the best of my ability, relentless sincerity, credulity, wit, and yes, shamelessness, but, crucially, shameability, too—openness to being justly shamed.

By the same token, two academics, Jenny Sundén and Susanna Paasonen, have lately published research on Finnish Twitter users’ reclaiming of what were once powerfully silencing misogynist terms like hagga (hag), kukkahattutäti (literally “aunt with a flower hat,” referring to supporters of cultural diversity, gender equality, and social justice), and suvakkihuora (“overtly tolerant whore”). They end on a hopeful note: “A networked politics of reclaiming is taking shape, one using collective imagination and wit to refuel feminist communities.”",0

When my onslaught came, several people advised me to depart from social media, not to read any of the threats I received, and certainly not to take them to heart. But, paradoxically, I feel like that’s taking the Fox News route: gas-lightily implying you would apologize if you had something to apologize for, while stopping up your ears and declaring that you will “never bow to the mob.” I don’t dislike mobs per se. And I think it hurts my heart less if I not only read my hate-mob’s screeds, but read them as real pieces of communication, really meant for me, from real people who mean what they say—not broadcasts to the void. It has occurred to me that, if this orientation hasn’t driven me mad, it might actually be the case that I was mad already. Two years ago, after all, I had no inkling that I might one day be invited onto an ultra-lucrative crypto-fascist talk show to discuss family abolition and abortion.

Since he bravely dissbled comments like so many other right wing snowflakes let me point out the deception of his response. He is stating that todays Democrats are the same party that supported slavery and ran the south until the mid 1900s. Even middle school children here in Atlanta Georgia learn better Ron. When Democrat President FDR, then Democrat President LBJ worked to improve the lives of poor, often black, voters the Democrat party began to be popular with people of color. This was intolerable to the racists in the party, who were known as Southern Democrats. These racists began looking for a new political home. The Republican party was concerned about losing its supporters so was looking for new voters at the same time and came up with the successful “southern strategy” to attract those Southern Democrats. The end result was a mass migration of racists from the Democrat party to the Republican party, and at the same time the Democrat party embraced new voters who wrre of minority backgrounds. By now the racists have completely abandoned the Democrat party and have overtaken the GOP. Take a look at the migration of overtly racist politicians from the Democrats to the GOP in the late 1950s through the 1960s. Look up the GOP southern strategy. You will find the proof of what I just wrote.",0

They’ve begun to believe that people “on the left” can’t possibly be Christian’s, etc. The list goes on and it’s incredibly discouraging.

I would argue that anytime you hear someone “on the right” begin a sentence with “The left believes…. or The Libs want… or The radical left don’t want you know know about…”. Anytime a comment is made with those statements as precursors, your “spidey sense” should be on alert. Why? Because blanket statements like those aren’t true. One of the hundreds of example of this comes from Tucker Carlson, who said “The left believes that sending your child to a public swimming pool is tantamount to murder….but the virus suddenly won’t affect you if you go out to loot, destroy property and protest”. Statements like these are the basis for his show. He normalizes the absurd. He rattles off multiple statements that he knows are inflammatory and deceptive. Always beginning with something similar to “The left believes…etc”. What he basically does is create the belief that they (meaning Tucker and Fox News, etc) are the only ones with the real truth. They have the inside track on what is truly happening, everyone is just “fake news”. Do you really think that everyone on “The Left” believes that allowing your child to go swimming in a public pool is equal to murder? By normalizing the extreme with absurd statement after absurd statement, he’s intentionally misleading his viewers into believing that “The Right” has a monopoly on truth. The other thing is, repeat something enough times until it becomes an acceptable truth. You’ll hear common themes from Fox News’ commentators. They will all hit a certain concept or statement or story over and over and over again. They’ll say the same kinds of things and repeat, rinse then repeat until the deceptions become truths.",0

1453579829689737218,@bblock29 Tucker Carlson is a slut of the lowest order for how he indulges his abuse of decency.,"First, it’s important to differentiate between Fox’s news reporters and their commentators. Fox News has a small number of well-respected journalists, like Bret Baier, John Roberts, and Chris Wallace, who strive to be fair to the facts and try to avoid overt partisanship. But while their reporting is often admirable, they are not what Fox News’ viewers love the most. The network is far better known for its commentators, who are rarely objective, and who often manipulate or even make up the facts, in service of a pro-Republican agenda. They intentionally promote conspiracy theories, make inflammatory remarks about social issues, and frequently misrepresent anything that Democrats have said or done, in order to make Democrats look bad and Republicans look good.",0
1453579829689737218,@bblock29 Tucker Carlson is a slut of the lowest order for how he indulges his abuse of decency.,"If you know Fox News’ history, this is not shocking, even if some of us who like factual information find it disappointing. Fox News was created in 1996 to be the media arm of the Republican party. Its mission is to provide a safe space for pro-Republican viewpoints and a friendly platform for pro-Republican politicians. Some commentators have even openly campaigned on behalf of Republican candidates, using misinformation and myth that has frequently been debunked by fact-checkers (but is widely believed on the right). So, if you want a network that caters to conservatives and Republicans, often at the expense of accuracy, then Fox News is for you. The network’s audience (which tends to be white men and women over the age of fifty-five, the vast majority of whom identify as conservative) is passionately loyal and has remained so over the years.",0
1453579829689737218,@bblock29 Tucker Carlson is a slut of the lowest order for how he indulges his abuse of decency.,"But the problem is the network’s journalists must often do their work while surrounded by people who are rarely fair to the facts. Sometimes, the journalists (who pride themselves on being accurate) have objected to what their commentator colleagues are claiming, but it doesn’t matter to the viewers. The Fox News audience has come to love and believe folks like Bill O’Reilly (gone from the network now, but very popular when he was on the air) and Sean Hannity, even when what they say is demonstrably false.",0
1453579829689737218,@bblock29 Tucker Carlson is a slut of the lowest order for how he indulges his abuse of decency.,"So, for me, it’s not the right-wing ideology that’s the problem. It’s the willingness to disseminate falsehoods in support of a partisan political agenda. For readers who want to bring up the (allegedly) “liberal media,” my point is that commentators who spread false information, even if what they are claiming makes you feel good, are not helpful for our democracy— news consumers need accurate information so they can make informed decisions. Fox News is not making the electorate more intelligent or better informed. And that, in my view, is what makes Fox News, and other overtly partisan outlets like them (talking to you, Sinclair), detrimental to our culture.",0

Poor Pucker Carlson, he scrunches up his nicely groomed face and squeaks his right-wing hoohah, leaving the diehard Trumpists and Rushists to long for the olden days.",0

1453579829689737218,@bblock29 Tucker Carlson is a slut of the lowest order for how he indulges his abuse of decency.,"Tucker Carlson is more of a libertarian than a mainstream conservative like Rush although there are some similarities. They both have a unique ability to get under the skin of lefties. I think that Tucker has let some of his recent fame get to his head and seems to be taking himself much too seriously now days —which Rush never did. Still, Tucker has the cajones to say things that other, even others in conservative media, and certainly Republican politicians would never say, such as when he suggested that FBI undercover agents and informants might have been instigators of Jan 6th. Tucker drives the folks at CNN batty and the more they attack him, the more popular Tucker will become. But he will never be Rush.",0

1453579829689737218,@bblock29 Tucker Carlson is a slut of the lowest order for how he indulges his abuse of decency.,I doubt it. Rush became an institution in the political world and changed it. Carlson’s got a following only because of his employer and their decision to give him a prime time show slot. Carlson’s not a great thinker. He’s still very much a little boy on the maturity spectrum.,0
1453579829689737218,@bblock29 Tucker Carlson is a slut of the lowest order for how he indulges his abuse of decency.,There will never be another Rush but he led the way for many conservative talk show hosts. Tucker Carlson has been in news and commentary for many years but has found his niche with his current show. Carlson already is very influential and his show has more viewers each night than all of the other cable shows combined.,1

The other quarter of comments are Waaahing about her plastic surgery, and only the final quarter sing sacred songs of her fierce immortality.",0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"So hey. If recognition and societal relevance is the gauge of a happy life, Madonna, Debbie, and a big, fat etcetera are damned if they do try to keep up their original style and damned if they don’t. For both/all sexes, it gets harder to be taken seriously as a culture-shaker the less collagen you have in your skin, and people with a lot of collagen in their skin (and not a lot of wisdom in their skulls) control what is recognized as cool and what is not.",0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,And that’s what happened to Madonna.,0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"Keep breathing and it’ll happen to you, too.",0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,It has taken me a few days to be ready to actually answer this question ... I spent a few years in Madonna's inner circle ... but keep in mind that the Madonna I knew and worked with was a very different version than what she is today. Unlike other Artists I have worked with I don't see or speak with her anymore.,0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"When I was twenty-four and a working dancer, I was given the extraordinary opportunity to become a Choreographer. Now mind you I was happy being a working dancer who at that time had established myself with Choreographers in both NY and LA, so that I could work as much as I liked in in jobs that I enjoyed, be it Stage, Films, commercials or Music videos …",0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"Well in the space of three months I was offered my first two Choreography jobs … the first was a feature film … I met with the producer and the director and listened to their vision for the sequence to be choreographed…it was right up my alley as I had recently finished touring with Stevie Nicks and the script called for the hero to play a rock and roll song at the “enchantment under the sea” dance which was the climax of the movie … the character was to play guitar in multiple styles that, within the story … had not been invented yet... The film was Back to the Future, and it turned out to be quite a great way to begin my Choreography in Film career.",0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"I apologize for the digression, but it seems important to tell the story in context … So after I booked the job, but had yet to start rehearsals for it, I did another dance gig for my friend Choreographer Kenny Ortega. It was the American Music Awards and it was always a fun job as it only took about three weeks to rehearse, and Kenny always hired the best dancers and the most fun by far!!! We danced the opening number and if my memory serves me right, it was with Lionel Richie who at the time was at the peak of his popularity. Well I was featured quite a bit in the number as Kenny used to like to utilize my skills in a way that gave me plenty of solo featured time…Madonna was in the front row, and was to perform Like a Virgin later in that broadcast. Now I had already been listening to her first album Borderline and enjoyed it quite a bit but Virgin was just being released and had yet to climb the charts. I will admit that I very much played to her during the number, making eye contact several times, and focusing very much on her,seated front and center.",0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"Two days later I received a phone call from Madonna asking if I would care to go to dinner with her. “Sure,” I said, having no idea what this might be about. Well I picked her up at her hotel room (she had not actually made the move to LA and was therefore staying in a hotel until she could get her bearings in the sprawling suburbs that is Los Angeles) and we went to one of my then-favorite restaurants Le Dome … it no longer exists but was in its day a Hollywood watering hole where one never knew who might be at the adjacent table … Well not three minutes into the conversation she asked me is I would be interested in Directing and Choreographing her upcoming first American tour … The Virgin Tour. After swallowing my stomach, I said “YES”, and we then spent the rest of the meal getting to know each other and sharing bits and pieces of our histories … We also talked of the album which had been released several weeks earlier, and she shared with me some ideas regarding how she had conceptualized the look of the show etc… after dinner she invited me to accompany her to a club where her ex-Jellybean Benitez was D.J.-ing. We went and stood in the DJ booth … danced a few tracks and I took her home.",0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"So to the question: What is Madonna like in person? She was one of the most magnetic women I have ever met. She somehow demanded that everyone look at her when she walked in a room. She had the ability to seduce everyone, period. Men, women, straight, gay, it didn’t matter. She had that rare IT quality that makes a star … Other stars I’ve worked with have it, like Cher. But I’ve never seen anyone use it with such razor sharp focus … like a weapon. Once she decided she wanted something or someone, BOOM, she got them. It was like being caught in a spider’s web … I watched her use her charms on every person she met. It was like her super power! I often would say that she was a triple threat … she couldn’t sing, dance or act very well. Really her talent was minimal at best. But what she had was determination and charisma with a capital C. What her real talent was, I believe, was her ability to work harder than almost anyone I know. That, and her ability to market herself … I believe if she wasn’t a performer she would have been a marketing genius for some advertising company.",0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"The years I knew and worked with her were the at the very beginning of her career. I remember I was in her kitchen eating cold pizza with her for breakfast, (she had moved into the same building as I so that we could drive to rehearsals together and to band rehearsals together), when the phone rang … ""hello? uh-huh … ok, cool."" She hung up. I asked her who that was and she calmly told me without missing a beat, ”that was my accountant in NY … he said I just made my first million” … I almost gagged on my pizza and she was as calm as a cucumber. She knew that this would be only the first of hundreds of millions of dollars she would make. She had SUCH confidence in herself.",0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"During the time we were working on putting the tour together her star was rising quickly … She was suddenly on the covers of magazines like Time … it was a very heady time. The Virgin Tour turned out to be a monster success with the video of it being the #1 seller that year. And I was nominated for an MTV award for best choreography for one of the videos taken from it. I continued to work with her into the True Blue album, working on Open Your Heart, and earning another nomination for it …",0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"One of my sweetest memories of that time with Madonna was sitting in an almost empty movie theater on a Sunday night, sharing a tub of popcorn and watching The Breakfast Club... talk about your Eighties moment.",0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"Madonna in my opinion is not very talented in any way. She is not the best singer, the best dancer, the best actress or the best looking girl. She is also said to be very rude. In fact, music producers and record company’s executives questioned her existence in music industry for a long time and thought she would be soon forgotten . Her rival at the time was if you remember Cindy Lauper who is by far more talented.Only to be proven wrong.Madonna is the ultimate byproduct of shock value and self promotion. She is no doubt very clever. Everyone knows that in the beginning of her career she slept her way to the top.But, apart from being promiscuous, which is not so rare after all, she is also very disciplined, hard working and resilient. The moment she started being successful she quit drugs. When everybody hated her for being too provocative she used all the bad publicity for her own benefit. She didn’t crack no matter her turbulent personal life, professional mistakes or failures, she moved on.Not only did she put everything behind and moved on, she was literally resurrected from her own ashes. She managed to stay relevant by changing completely her style every time she released an album she was a completely different woman in every single way, her outfits, her hair style, her music, her songs.She evolved, didn’t remain static. While others indulge to drugs and alcohol, like Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey, she found an outlet to sports and yoga.I think her self confidence is that makes her so special though, she may lack everything else. She is very self confident and works very hard. I think of her more of as a business woman rather than an artist. As she herself said when asked about her height ‘’everything about me is average’’.She must have had a bad reaction to some medicine as she actually told the truth. Madonna is mediocre at everything she does, to say the least, but she has built her career on manic ambition, courage and physical strength. Her most successful imitator Lady Gaga is musically far superior.",0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"Madonna was insecure because she knew that she had very limited talent and was very average thus she dissed younger artists than her . Of course they answered to her insults. Madonna when asked about Mariah said that she would rather be dead than be Mariah Carey and Mariah, the queen of shade, said ‘’Madonna used to be popular many years ago , when i was still on 6th grade so i am not familiar with her songs any more’’. Janet on the other hand said that she believed that what she did as an artist, unlike Madonna, had some class to it. Madonna has also referred to Lady Gaga as reductive. Cher said that Madonna is one of the rudest people she has ever met in her entire life.",0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"The reasons why Madonna became such a memorable presence in the 80's and 90's were because of her:
- Rebellious and controversial songs 
- Brash sexuality 
- Presence in multiple media (music, books, films, documentaries, etc) 
- Iconic Fashion 
- Dancing/Choreography
- Consistent collaborations with guys like Stephen Bray and Patrick Leonard, who helped her craft songs that connected with a generation.",0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"Madonna no longer has any of those things going for her. 
 * She's too old to make songs about youthful rebellion (""Papa Don't Preach"") and there is nothing controversial about her or her music. 
 * Even with lots of cosmetic surgery, her sex appeal is gone
 * Her empire and overall marketability have faltered. 
 * She's no longer a fashion icon. That crown is held by other pop stars like Lady Gaga, Rihanna and Iggy Azalea. 
 * She can't dance anymore. As an example, just watch a replay of her performance at the Super Bowl XLVI Halftime show, where her background dancers left her in the dust. 
 * She collaborates with anyone and everyone nowadays. This results in the occasional popular single, as when she worked with Mirwais, Timbaland or The Neptunes, but nothing groundbreaking and nothing lasting.",0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"Her career is far from over. She will continue to make music, and it will generate moderate sales. But after two decades of dominance (80's and 90's) and another decade of relevance (00's), it was only a matter of time before she eventually hit a decline.",0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"I think that it should be said that Madonna is very petty, very immature and an all around rotten person. Don't get me wrong, I was a huge Madonna fan back in the “Borderline/Like a Virgin"" days and I thought Madonna was great… in magazines. Over time, I learned that Madonna wasn't a very nice person, didn't care about her fans and was only in the music industry because she could talk/BS her way into just about anything. She didn't play any instruments, could barely carry a tune, forced out choreographed dance routines and blew off fans because they “annoyed"" her.",0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,Enter Lady Gaga.,0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"After Lady Gaga’s popularity began to skyrocket, Madonna's true colors really began to shine through. I never even imagined that anyone could be so petty, so immature and so wrong at the same time. I have posted a link to a video that very clearly demonstrates how a 58 year old woman can be so self-absorbed, petty and jealous at the same time. Be sure to watch until the very end where Madonna truly shows who she really is.",0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"https://youtu.be/nNQxsFcyALU
And on another note, I was both a Madonna fan and a Gaga fan, believing that there was room for both of them in the music industry. Then Madonna started running her mouth about Gaga. Calling her a ‘dog' and ‘reductive' implying that Gaga was nothing but a copy-cat on national television! The ‘fued' that Madonna has kept burning for years but has YET to confront Lady Gaga face-to-face.",0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"I have yet to hear Gaga put Madonna down or ridicule her in any way. Today, Madonna is 60 years old and Lady Gaga is 32 and even to this day, Madonna can only talk sh*t behind Gaga's back. I do believe it is time for Madonna to call it quits and let the younger generation, the generation with REAL talent, take over the industry.",0

1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"Madonna was known to grow up as a vegetarian as she said in an interview many years ago that she started while young. Then she started employing the so-called Macrobiotic living, a fad like Keto, for as long as she’s been friends with Rosie O’Donnell, as attested by the latter. The Macrobiotic diet [ https://draxe.com/macrobiotic-diet/ ] is known for it’s restrictive food choices and that it comes with many different levels, each level becoming more and more restrictive with respect to food selections. The fad diet seem to resemble a failed Japanese experiment on green living and nutrition but even today it has picked up some modern vegan adherents, most of which you can follow online. You can start with eating various seafoods and end with not eating any of them at all. Going through your midlife employing deficient diet methods is detrimental, if not dangerous.",0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"Madonna is also known for her daily devotion to working out, as attested by her lean, if not gnarly, extremities. She practiced yoga daily and in her mid-50s she kept the lifestyle of a 25–30-year-old with the strenuous workouts, which in my opinion should not be advisable anymore for those who’s already gone thru midlife.",0

1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,she is an entertainer and a world famous scrutinized one at that! Her every move is under a microscope.,0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,she has to put on a mask because it sells and her “performance” as an artist catapulted her to fame.,0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,i dont know her personally but as a woman dominating the charts in a patriarchal old school mens club she is an expert in keeping herself relevant to many generations.,0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,to her credit she advocates for human rights and the lgbtq community and donates shitloads of money for hiv and aids research,0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,hey that is remarkable.,0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,on the flip side is she arrogant yes,0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,is she a tad narcissistic i would say so yes,0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,im sure success fame and money can reshape you in ways we can only imagine,0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,is she good ? Well she stands firmly against trump so to her credit (as a canadian) that is a bonus,0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,listen is she soulless well i cant judge her because just by stating im canadian or gay i automatically have been prejudged in a negative light to some folks.,0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,on a different level she is known for her dip into spirituality now my gut instinct and years of experience with cluster b types is a lot are incapable of growth or introspection,0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,I cannot judge her heart and relationship with the creator thats not for me,0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,but all that veing said she did tell former prince harry that canada is boring does that make her a narsole? It makes her a bitch which we kinda already gathered. Personally i love my country and i cant say that canada that i know is boring so again that just makes her look terribly because i can sit in the mountains and breathe crisp air watching the sun bath the mountains and lakes watching a train slowly creep along and be completely in awe with the beauty and ill take that any single day over disney land !,0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,is she a bit of an elitist wealthy and uppity yes,0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,but again she is entertainer so do we really know her true personality i dunno …,0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,i hope when my time is done ill be known not for my money fame or wealth but how i treated people and how i gave not took,0

1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,There's your answer.,0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,Age! That is the real reason. Radio will just not play her anymore. They think teens (radio’s market) won’t listen to a 61 Pop star even though her new music is just as good as always.,0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"For example, her single Ghosttown is incredible and would have been played over and over and even hit #1 had it been sung by a young artist. The same applies to one of her latest singles called I Rise. It’s such an awesome song almost like an anthem.",0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"On a positive note, all her songs made into remixes for the clubs still go to #1 on the Dance Charts. Her newest song Crave went to #1 giving her her 49th #1. That’s mind-blowing.",0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"Madonna has a large loyal fan base, though, so she still sells. Her newest album Madame X debuted at #1. She also still tours and her current tour called The Madame X Show has been a huge success all over the world. Every review gives the tour high praises.",0

1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"That’s an unknown, probably to her too. She peaked. She has a library of great music which is a bit dated. She’ll always have that, which is quite an achievement.",0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"She’s also outspoken about her political views. Because she lives in a great country, or she used to live here, she was free to be outspoken. Should she have been outspoken? That depends.",0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"Not if she still wants to have mass appeal, musically, as an entertainer. She’s using her gift of freedom to alienate a lot of people. That’s her choice, nothing wrong with that decision.",0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"My guess is that she doesn’t care if she has mass appeal anymore. She has enough money. That money is probably the root of her not making music that we want to listen to meaning that she’s lost her edge. She’s not hungry anymore.

Maybe what you really mean is that she is no longer popular or musically relevant. That’s true she no longer is. Her current standing has also been damaged by her recent musical attempts that have fallen flat. You are only as good as your last hit in the music industry. Still, she is already a legend and will always be respected because of her past accomplishments, whereas most of the popular ones today have no chance of becoming a legend.",0

1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"There’s nothing “wrong” with any of the above. The business has been kind to Madonna, and in her 60s she is still making music and putting bums on seats, which she is perfectly free to do.",0

1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"I think there is a reason while bands like Depeche Mode and AC/DC are still very popular although never being the biggest stars in the world, while other artists are more or less forgotten two weeks after their last hit.

The exception being when you get so ridiculously big and famous as Michael Jackson or Elvis Presley.",0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"One way to get remembers is if your music created a new genre or inspired a lot of other bands of later generations. That is why a band that barely sold a records like Velvet Underground is so well remembered by people who know rock music to this day, while someone like Leo Sayer that sold over a million of his greatest record and won Grammies is forgotten. If you inspired artists you get remembered because you constantly get referenced by later generations of bands and music journalists.",0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"Another reason for being remembers if you are one of those artists that people use to create an identity, even though this is not as much of a thing now as it used to. Bands like Iron Maiden and AC/DC were once the mark of youth working class identity and dress many places, Depeche Mode and the Cure inspired the subcultures of “alternative youth” in the eighties and so on. When an artist is so important to someone they will help keep their memory alive for decades to come.",0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"When it comes to Madonna however, she made great music and many listened to it, but she did not inspire a subgenre of copycat artists and few if any youth identified as “Madonna fans” as such.",0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"As I have said before, liking any artist or singer or musician is relative. Relative to what or who YOU like. Some might say Elvis was a bad singer? Well, again what do you think?",0

1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,Some of Madonna’s many achievements:,0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,She has been known as the Queen of Pop since the 1980’s.,0

1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"She is listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the best-selling female recording artist and the fourth best-selling act of all time, behind The Beatles, Elvis Presley, and Michael Jackson with 300 million albums sold.",0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,She holds the record for most No. 1’s on all combined Billboard Charts.,0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,She is the Highest Grossing Solo Artist of all time with over $1.4 Billion in concert tours throughout her career.,0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"Various music journalists, critical theorists, and authors have deemed Madonna the most influential female recording artist of all time.",0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,She topped VH-1’s 100 Greatest Women in Rock.,0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"She is an accomplished Singer, Songwriter, Dancer, Choreographer, Producer, Director, Actress and businesswoman tat has not only set new boundaries in Rock, Pop, Disco, Dance, etc… but built them, torn them down and built them again.",0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"These are merely a drop in the bucket in terms of the myriad of accomplishments this woman has achieved. Now, I would not call myself a Madonna Superfan, but as a Singer/Songwriter, I do appreciate the efforts put forward by individuals that have excelled in their craft and Madonna has certainly done that.",0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"If you were to actually go into a room, put on some of her music and just listen undisturbed to her voice and the way she uses it, I’m confident you might find a certain appeal to what she does. I believe that most people never really LISTEN to music or singing. I tend to believe that people find something that grabs their immediate attention, turn it on, and while they do whatever it is they are doing, hear the sounds in the background. It is easy to like something that is really catchy in the background, but to actually listen and hear the sounds is how one can really begin to appreciate the musicianship, the singing as an art, the production and then all of it together. It really is quite amazing as to what is out there… Not so much the current stuff as opposed to the stuff from the 60’s, 70’s, and 80’s.",0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"I agree completely with the answer before me. I will also add that I’ve seen her in concert 5 times and have watched many-many times her tour dvd/blurays. In both the live in-concert and on tv, she sings well in almost all cases. Important to point out that in all her performances she is dancing like crazy while singing. If you yourself have done this then you will know it is not easy to do. So, I think that gives her extra points.",0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,I want to point out a few things about her singing performances seeing there are several doubters out there:,0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"* She HAS lip synced during performances, but it is rare. She is a live singer.
 * Her best live performance IMO is Drowned World Substitute for Love on the Confessions Tour. I’ve seen it live and on dvd many times. It’s remarkable and full of so much soul! Please watch it!

1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"No,shes not a powerhouse like Whitney or Mariah.But that means her voice is suited to nearly every genre.",0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"She has great tone,and shes a very emotive singer.",0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,Now Bob Dylan cant sing.,0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"Um, no. Bad singers don’t sell out arenas time after time after time and have hits that span decades. I point to her ballad collection ‘Something to Remember’ with songs like ‘You’ll See,’ ‘Live to Tell,’ or the title track to prove she a vulnerable, talented vocalist.",0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"Is she Whitney Houston? No. But, ‘bad’ is in the ear of the beholder at the end of the day.",0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,I LOVE Madonna. But it’s difficult to hear her real voice.,0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"It was a live Van Halen album , “Right hear right now” I remember it being called the first live album that used new technology to enhance its sound and I've been noticing such touch ups of live performances ever since. Especially on youtube.",0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"I watched Madonna preform at the Oscar's singing “Hanky Pankey” and “You Must Love Me,” and when I hear those performances now, they have been totally altered.",0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"I've seen that done with Mariah Careys performance in Tokyo and even Arerha Frankin when she had her own Divas Live..the year after the good one. The one where she attempted Nesum Dorma.. not the Grammy’s. I cringed. I get it, it happens, but I rewatched that performance shortly after and camera shots were added from the back and audio had been completly dubbed.",0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,Even live live performances use a type of auto tune to have the voice become magically in tune. Tim McGraw and Faith Hill have been criticized for using it.,0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,Madonna is to smart not to use it.,0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"She sings in tune, and has a pleasant sounding voice. So in my view, yes, she is a good singer.",0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"I haven’t seen much on other people’s negative opinions of Madonna, but I do know that she has this habit of changing the tonality of her voice to sound more nasal and girlish when she sings higher notes (which a singer should not do). When I was younger, I thought it was two different people singing “Music.”",0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"Watch her “performance” at Eurovision 2019. Yes, she is just as bad, if not worse than she’s said to be.",0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,She was pretty bad.,0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"Was she a genius at marketing herself with “sex sells"" approach and became a huge star? Yes.",0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,Is / Was she a good singer? I won't say so ..she could carry a decent tune but gets quite pitchy in her own songs (well written for her by others of course)...that's about it.,0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,I'll say this..there are 1000 other female singers from 80s that sang better..I think she kinda brought the whole “can't sing for sh*t? Market yourself baby!” to mainstream. I admire her videos but can't stand it if I'm listening to the song on radio.,0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,It has taken me a few days to be ready to actually answer this question ... I spent a few years in Madonna's inner circle ... but keep in mind that the Madonna I knew and worked with was a very different version than what she is today. Unlike other Artists I have worked with I don't see or speak with her anymore.,0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"When I was twenty-four and a working dancer, I was given the extraordinary opportunity to become a Choreographer. Now mind you I was happy being a working dancer who at that time had established myself with Choreographers in both NY and LA, so that I could work as much as I liked in in jobs that I enjoyed, be it Stage, Films, commercials or Music videos …",0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"Well in the space of three months I was offered my first two Choreography jobs … the first was a feature film … I met with the producer and the director and listened to their vision for the sequence to be choreographed…it was right up my alley as I had recently finished touring with Stevie Nicks and the script called for the hero to play a rock and roll song at the “enchantment under the sea” dance which was the climax of the movie … the character was to play guitar in multiple styles that, within the story … had not been invented yet... The film was Back to the Future, and it turned out to be quite a great way to begin my Choreography in Film career.",0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"I apologize for the digression, but it seems important to tell the story in context … So after I booked the job, but had yet to start rehearsals for it, I did another dance gig for my friend Choreographer Kenny Ortega. It was the American Music Awards and it was always a fun job as it only took about three weeks to rehearse, and Kenny always hired the best dancers and the most fun by far!!! We danced the opening number and if my memory serves me right, it was with Lionel Richie who at the time was at the peak of his popularity. Well I was featured quite a bit in the number as Kenny used to like to utilize my skills in a way that gave me plenty of solo featured time…Madonna was in the front row, and was to perform Like a Virgin later in that broadcast. Now I had already been listening to her first album Borderline and enjoyed it quite a bit but Virgin was just being released and had yet to climb the charts. I will admit that I very much played to her during the number, making eye contact several times, and focusing very much on her,seated front and center.",0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"Two days later I received a phone call from Madonna asking if I would care to go to dinner with her. “Sure,” I said, having no idea what this might be about. Well I picked her up at her hotel room (she had not actually made the move to LA and was therefore staying in a hotel until she could get her bearings in the sprawling suburbs that is Los Angeles) and we went to one of my then-favorite restaurants Le Dome … it no longer exists but was in its day a Hollywood watering hole where one never knew who might be at the adjacent table … Well not three minutes into the conversation she asked me is I would be interested in Directing and Choreographing her upcoming first American tour … The Virgin Tour. After swallowing my stomach, I said “YES”, and we then spent the rest of the meal getting to know each other and sharing bits and pieces of our histories … We also talked of the album which had been released several weeks earlier, and she shared with me some ideas regarding how she had conceptualized the look of the show etc… after dinner she invited me to accompany her to a club where her ex-Jellybean Benitez was D.J.-ing. We went and stood in the DJ booth … danced a few tracks and I took her home.",0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"So to the question: What is Madonna like in person? She was one of the most magnetic women I have ever met. She somehow demanded that everyone look at her when she walked in a room. She had the ability to seduce everyone, period. Men, women, straight, gay, it didn’t matter. She had that rare IT quality that makes a star … Other stars I’ve worked with have it, like Cher. But I’ve never seen anyone use it with such razor sharp focus … like a weapon. Once she decided she wanted something or someone, BOOM, she got them. It was like being caught in a spider’s web … I watched her use her charms on every person she met. It was like her super power! I often would say that she was a triple threat … she couldn’t sing, dance or act very well. Really her talent was minimal at best. But what she had was determination and charisma with a capital C. What her real talent was, I believe, was her ability to work harder than almost anyone I know. That, and her ability to market herself … I believe if she wasn’t a performer she would have been a marketing genius for some advertising company.",0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"The years I knew and worked with her were the at the very beginning of her career. I remember I was in her kitchen eating cold pizza with her for breakfast, (she had moved into the same building as I so that we could drive to rehearsals together and to band rehearsals together), when the phone rang … ""hello? uh-huh … ok, cool."" She hung up. I asked her who that was and she calmly told me without missing a beat, ”that was my accountant in NY … he said I just made my first million” … I almost gagged on my pizza and she was as calm as a cucumber. She knew that this would be only the first of hundreds of millions of dollars she would make. She had SUCH confidence in herself.",0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"During the time we were working on putting the tour together her star was rising quickly … She was suddenly on the covers of magazines like Time … it was a very heady time. The Virgin Tour turned out to be a monster success with the video of it being the #1 seller that year. And I was nominated for an MTV award for best choreography for one of the videos taken from it. I continued to work with her into the True Blue album, working on Open Your Heart, and earning another nomination for it …",0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"One of my sweetest memories of that time with Madonna was sitting in an almost empty movie theater on a Sunday night, sharing a tub of popcorn and watching The Breakfast Club... talk about your Eighties moment.",0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,She can`t tell time.,0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"She shows her fans a lot of disrespect by starting so many of her concerts an hour ,two or three hours late Too many that it it could not all be blamed on technical problems. Any artist, Madonna ,Lauren Hill or any others that have a history of extremely late concerts make it obvious they don`t respect the fans who make their lifestyle possible.",0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"She is not very talented. Her vocal abilities are very limited. Her talent is her tireless work ethic, manic ambition and military discipline. She is rude. She is jealous of younger artists like Lady Gaga, whose vocal abilities are ten times better. She was also jealous of Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston. She considers Sean Penn who beat the shit out of her when they were married the love of her life. She is promiscuous. She was smitten with Michael Jackson who did not like her at all. He named a python he had after her because he did not like her. By her own admission she is average at everything. She is a shrewd businesswoman. She is extremely intelligent. She is a mediocre singer, actress and dancer. She is very resilient. Her son Rocco preferred to live with his stepmother than her because Madonna would put him down in public non stop. She has adopted 4 kids from Malawi and has funded a hospital and schools there.",0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"I think that it should be said that Madonna is very petty, very immature and an all around rotten person. Don't get me wrong, I was a huge Madonna fan back in the “Borderline/Like a Virgin"" days and I thought Madonna was great… in magazines. Over time, I learned that Madonna wasn't a very nice person, didn't care about her fans and was only in the music industry because she could talk/BS her way into just about anything. She didn't play any instruments, could barely carry a tune, forced out choreographed dance routines and blew off fans because they “annoyed"" her.",0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,Enter Lady Gaga.,0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"After Lady Gaga’s popularity began to skyrocket, Madonna's true colors really began to shine through. I never even imagined that anyone could be so petty, so immature and so wrong at the same time. I have posted a link to a video that very clearly demonstrates how a 58 year old woman can be so self-absorbed, petty and jealous at the same time. Be sure to watch until the very end where Madonna truly shows who she really is.",0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"https://youtu.be/nNQxsFcyALU
And on another note, I was both a Madonna fan and a Gaga fan, believing that there was room for both of them in the music industry. Then Madonna started running her mouth about Gaga. Calling her a ‘dog' and ‘reductive' implying that Gaga was nothing but a copy-cat on national television! The ‘fued' that Madonna has kept burning for years but has YET to confront Lady Gaga face-to-face.",0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"I have yet to hear Gaga put Madonna down or ridicule her in any way. Today, Madonna is 60 years old and Lady Gaga is 32 and even to this day, Madonna can only talk sh*t behind Gaga's back. I do believe it is time for Madonna to call it quits and let the younger generation, the generation with REAL talent, take over the industry.",0

1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"Horrible person. I was in one of Guy Ritchies films. We were filming at Cafe de Paris, in London. To be honest even Guy isn’t a very nice person. Anyway the scene I was doing that day required me to be be in stockings and not much else really, apart from a horrendous black wig, when I was blonde. I was shooting a very intense scene, closed set obviously. Anyway who suddenly walks in..Madonna! Firstly, in real life she doesn’t look anything like she does in magazines. She wasn't even pleasant to her own husband, or the other actors. So to be honest I don’t know why she even bothered coming there.",0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"She stared at me constantly for about 40 minutes, then demanded all filming had to be stopped. I was like ok, it will just be a break, nothing abnormal about that, it happens all the time on set. But this scene hadn’t been cut, there was much more dialogue to get through. But anyway she decided filming was over. Guy didn’t look happy. But what does she do? She makes only females go back to the hair and makeup room, and not just make sure we stay there, but she makes them, her team, lock us in! There wasn’t even a toilet in there. We must have been in there for about 3 hours. So she was either incredibly insecure with women around Guy, or she was either jealous or god knows what.",0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"So I didn’t actually talk to her, but I got evil looks for about 40 minutes and then got locked in a room. She didn’t have to talk to me, for me to know she had serious issues and thought she was above even God. Also her treating her then husband like a piece of crap. I know it’s not that interesting. But unfortunately I was locked in a room by her crew! Janet Jackson was actually the nicest person I’ve worked with, and Colin Firth.",0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"I ‘met’ Madonna a decade or so ago at the gym that my wife and I used to attend in London. On Friday nights we used to like to go to the gym to destress after the working week. As we got to the reception my wife whispers to me ‘Hey that’s Lourdes, Madonna’s daughter’. Now I had had a rough week and not being a big fan I kind of shrugged an acknowledgement and grabbed our coats and headed to the locker room to put them away. I walked onto the gym floor toward my wife who was on one of the exercise bikes and as I pass by she says to me ‘Can you get me some water?’ so I turn around and say ‘Honey you just sat down, how about you grab yourself some water’. At the same time as she’s saying this she is doing this strange repeated sideways nod with her head so I say ‘ Honey are you feeling alright?’ and then I look left and there’s Madonna on the next bike. Anyway unconsciously I mouth the words ‘Ah….Madonna’ and I crack an awkward smile and slink off to the mats to do some stretching with Madonna eyeballing me the whole time. A minute or two later from across the room I see my wife and Madonna engaging in a conversation and laughing, so at the end of the workout I ask my wife what they talked about and she goes ‘Madonna said ‘I hope he’s good in bed because he’s not very clever….’",0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,Oh and she is probably one of the fittest people I’ve ever seen in the gym - she spent an hour or so just doing chin ups with her personal trainer and she would put most professional athletes to shame.,0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"Although I did not meet her officially, we had an interesting exchange at a party one time. It was a small get together for some friends in a bar in New York around 2005. I went to the bar to get a drink and when I returned to my friends guess who was standing directly behind me? Madonna! And she remained arms distance away for about 30 minutes as she spoke with her friends. (She is tiny, happy and was smiling/ laughing a lot). At this point Madonna and group proceeded to the dance floor and she disappeared from my sight. I grabbed a drink and also went to dance with my friends, though Madonna was nowhere to be seen. After an hour had passed she reappeared - directly in front of me as she was saying good bye to someone in my group. This was my chance haha - I said, “Madonna I love you”. She just stood there smiling, so I said “No really, I love you”. To my shock, she then came right up and kissed me. No words exchanged. Just a simple kiss. I have heard she can be cold and unfriendly, however my experience shows that she can be the exact opposite. Her human side was shown. And she could sense my genuine adoration. (I am not one of those “crazy” fans). I don’t feel she would have done this under “normal” circumstances from a fan in day to day life, but instead felt comfortable doing it due to the intimate nature of the party we were both attending for a mutual friend.",0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"I was lucky enough to meet Madonna (one on one was brief) during the Blonde Ambition Tour in Ann Arbor Hills, Michigan back in 1990.  I would venture to say she was truly just beginning her ascension into her unwavering status of iconic legend.  Don't get me wrong, she has always been popular & a media focal attention but as I said, I believe this era to be where she was becoming parallel to the likes of Michael Jackson...and the price of her concert tickets soon reflected that.",0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"I spent the better part of two days (there were 2 performances as the first show sold out) back stage hanging out and talking with everyone working the show (including her musicians, opening band - Technotronic, family members in the audience & VIP persons).  Back in my younger days,  I was said to resemble Ms. Ciccone & perhaps I did, a stage persons (manager?) grabbed me & gave me a back stage pass saying something under his breath about family not being marked or treated well & Madonna would freak.   He thought I was a sister & I didn't correct his error.  Duh?!",0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"The ""help"" really seemed to enjoy working with Madge or Mo,  as they called her.  The majority of those who would talk, (confidentiality forms were signed prior to employment) had good things to say about her.  I heard she was kind, a bitch (isn't any woman in an authoritative position who wants shit done right), fun, hard working, motivated, creative, caring (she constantly handed out condoms to staff & told them to use them), focused, crazy...etc.  People feared getting on her bad side but I could see they respected her as well.  There was admiration for her, not just because she employed them.  I believe,  they knew they were in the presence of someone powerful.  This is all purely speculative on my part, but based on conversations and body language from those I spoke with for 2 days.",0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"When I met Madonna, she had just come off stage from the end of her show the second night.  I had been standing in front of the front row all night with her father, brother & some others.  At the time, Truth or Dare was being filmed.  Our eyes met several times when she was looking down at her family from the stage she was probably wondering who I was & what the hell I was doing with her family.",0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"When she came off stage, someone introduced us.  She was cordial, she said hello.  I nodded, younger days of being starstruck prevented me from speaking.  Good thing, I'm sure I would have regretted anything that spewed from my mouth.  I remember thinking about how small & tiny she looked in person.  I walked behind her with the rest of the group to the after party area.  Along the way, listening to everything she was saying.  Her presence demanded attention but her words were seeking approval.  She wanted to impress her father, she was concerned about her brother (was drunk or fucked up or something of the sort), she was focused on next performance,  she was exhausted (learned later was under the weather) & she wanted everyone there to have a good time.  She acted differently around different people.  It was apparent when she wanted to be the center of attention.  I could give more intimate details but the summation would be the same.",0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"Madonna was a force to be reckoned with but in the end, if you look past the facade,  she was human just like the rest of us.  She was charismatic and driven (which obviously has had some bearing on her success) & she wanted to be loved & adored by millions.  Who doesn't?",0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"I once heard a story told by Billy Steinberg who wrote Like A Virgin with Tom Kelly. More than any other song, Like A Virgin turned Madonna into a superstar, but some years after its release, Billy and Tom had still never met her, so the story goes that they went to a party where they’d heard she would be, approached her and said “Hi Madonna, we’re Billy and Tom, we wrote Like A Virgin and we’ve always wanted to meet you.” Apparently Madonna said “Well now you have”, turned her back to them, and that was the end of the conversation.",0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"I was about 14 and was the babysitter for a guy who co-wrote songs for her True Blue album. (Pat Leonard) He had a studio in his basement & were working all day; me upstairs with the toddler. Up until that day I was a huge fan, so excited to meet her. But when I did it was brief. She was rude and dismissive to me. I was crushed & so disappointed. I think Pat was even embarrassed and felt bad, but what could he do?",0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"She's hard to earn her trust, she can be mean, but once you earn her trust. You're there.",0

1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,So that's what she give.,0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,Her MBTI type is ESTP. That means she is extroverted. It also means that she is a sensor and gets most of her intellectual stimulation from her senses as opposed to intuition. The letter T signifies that she is a thinker instead of a feeler. This means she usually takes decisions listening to her brain instead of her heart. Finally the letter P means she is a perceiver as opposed opposed to a judger. This implies that she tends to be slightly on the disorganized side of things but it gives her the advantage of letting thoughts mingle in her mind effortlessly to create new ideas.,0
1453579438218694659,Madonna is that bitch !!!!,"I often wonder that myself! As a 13 year old fan, I'd love to know what who my idol really is. So, I watched about 150 interviews, spoke to some fans who have met her, read up about people who have met her and gathered enough information to get her real personality.  Madonna is a nice bitch. If that makes any sense at all. She is a nice person, but you don't want to piss her off!",0

The film starts well, with 'everyman' Dean being drawn into a game of cat and mouse, framed for a crime he didn't commit and forced to go on the run from Government agents. Will Smith carries the film only so far but it realy gets interesting when Hackman turns up as Brill. He casts light on the ability of the government and is almost able to play them at their own game. Brill makes an appearance when the film starts to become too much of a staight chase movie.",0

Reports can smell blood and they run in to lick it up.","To me the use of Hackman as Brill is the best bit of casting ever and makes this film stand out as being clever. In the 70's Hackman played a surveillance expert in Copolla's The Conversation. The film ends with Hackman being monitored himself, with him ripping his house apart looking for the bugs. What makes his casting as Brill so good is that Brill is where Hackman's ""The Conversation"" character would be 20 years on - it feels like it's the same character again. The director also deserves a lot of praise - he manages to keep the pace up throughout the film, whether it be scenes of chasing action or technological pursuit. The script helps as well - the conspiracy and the paranoia is strong throughout.",0

Smith also struggles to carry the whole movie and the chases do get a bit samey after a while. Fortunately Hackman is brilliant as Brill, he is a classy actor and brings a lot of weight to the film just as Smith begins to feel the strain. Jon Voight is also good as the villian of the piece. The supporting cast is deep! There were so many famous faces in small roles that I really felt this was an allstar cast, despite the fact that it's a Smith vehicle. Gabriel Byrne makes a fleeting appearance, Ian Hart is there, Jake Busey (son of Gary) shows up, Jason Lee (actor in many Kevin Smith films) witnesses the murder, a gorgeous Lisa Bonet has a small part, James Le Gros, Regina King etc etc. The cast is well packed with famous faces - they don't all get the chance to put on a show but it adds quality at all levels.",0

The answer was simple, Barron replied. It was dirty because of all the immigrants. “Part of the reason is because her district is actually one of the least American districts in the country,” Barron replied. “Now by that, I don’t mean that it’s not part of America, but that it’s occupied by relatively few American citizens.

After proposing a number of theories against the shipping company, Carlson went on to detail the every-nook-and-cranny search for the documents throughout the “entire cavernous sorting facility,” adding, “The envelope was securely sealed. We know that.… UPS does not dispute that. Was the package torn open accidentally by a machine? That seems unlikely. UPS says that almost never happens.” He then leaped to a more malicious and specific accusation: The contents of his package had been stolen, which he described as the most “obvious explanation. Someone, for some reason, opened our package and removed a flash drive containing documents that were damaging to the Biden family.”",0

https://t.co/6356Sca6Wg","However, the day after the Fox News host began banging the war drums against UPS in front of his millions of viewers, the company explained to Daily Beast reporter Will Sommer that Carlson’s package had actually been located, which suggested that the Biden camp’s package-targeting extraction team had not, in fact, tactically removed the top secret contents of the parcel. (While Trump’s allies and the right-wing media have been consumed with Hunter Biden developments, NBC News reported Thursday evening that one “intelligence” document making the rounds, and its author, were fake.)",0
1453566009756028933,"Tucker Carlson is a colossal douchebag.

https://t.co/6356Sca6Wg","But after all of his commotion, Carlson suddenly backed off the story by Thursday night. “There are a lot of documents about Hunter Biden’s personal life that we haven’t brought to you and we’re not going to, and we should tell you why,” he said, adding that “Hunter Biden is a fallen man at this point.” And while he believes the Biden son is not “a bad person,” he does have “demons” and “lost control of those demons, and the world knows that now. He’s now humiliated and alone. It’s probably too strong to say we feel sorry for Hunter Biden, but the point is, pounding on a man, jumping on, piling on when he’s already down is something that we don’t want to be involved in.”",0

https://t.co/6356Sca6Wg","It’s not entirely clear why Carlson suddenly backed off the story, or why one of his own producers sent him documents in the most archaic, analog way possible instead of simply uploading them.

We will have all the details for you next week.”",0
1453543866511020041,@TuckerCarlson Tucker Carlson is a domestic terrorist.,"Tucker Carlson faced widespread condemnation from media figures, Republican lawmakers, and even one of his own Fox News colleagues after airing a trailer for his upcoming project that seemingly portrays the January 6 Capitol riot as a “false flag” operation orchestrated by the government. The promo for Carlson’s documentary series, titled Patriot Purge and airing next week on the Fox Nation streaming service, features one voice suggesting the U.S. government is waging a “domestic war on terror” against “half of the country.”",0
1453543866511020041,@TuckerCarlson Tucker Carlson is a domestic terrorist.,"The trailer, which opens with onscreen text that reads, “The true story behind 1/6” and “The War on Terror 2.0 and the plot against the people,” includes interviews with a man who claims “the left is hunting the right” and “sticking [American citizens] in Guantanamo Bay…leaving them there to rot.” Later in the promo, a woman asserts that “false flags have happened in this country. One of which may have been January 6.” A man is then shown firing a rifle at a shooting range as a narrator states “We are dealing with an insurgency in the United States,"" before the ad cuts to Joe Biden giving a speech in which he describes white supremacy as “the most lethal threat” in America.",0
1453543866511020041,@TuckerCarlson Tucker Carlson is a domestic terrorist.,"Carlson, who has previously suggested that federal agents may have set up the Trump supporters who are facing prosecution for storming the Capitol building, makes a personal appearance in the trailer, saying, “The helicopters have left Afghanistan, and now they’ve landed here at home.” While discussing the three-part series on Tucker Carlson Tonight, Fox’s most popular host said that he believes “it answers a lot of the remaining questions” regarding the Capitol riot. “Our conclusion? The U.S. government has in fact launched a new war on terror. But it’s not against al-Qaida, it’s against American citizens,” he added.",0
1453543866511020041,@TuckerCarlson Tucker Carlson is a domestic terrorist.,"On this week’s edition of Carlson’s Fox Nation program, he went as far to say that “you can see why the people who showed up in Washington on January 6 were mad,” and in September, he said that “the vast majority of people inside the Capitol on January 6 were peaceful. They were not insurrectionists, they shouldn’t have been there. They weren’t trying to overthrow the government. That’s a total crock.” Carlson’s remarks echo those of Republican lawmakers who have tried to downplay the deadly attack perpetrated by Trump’s supporters and fueled by his lies—with one congressman even characterizing the riot as a “normal tourist visit.”",0
1453543866511020041,@TuckerCarlson Tucker Carlson is a domestic terrorist.,"In an interview with The New York Times, Fox News host Geraldo Rivera criticized his colleague’s new project. “Tucker’s wonderful, he’s provocative, he’s original, but—man oh man. There are some things that you say that are more inflammatory and outrageous and uncorroborated,” he said. “I worry that—and I’m probably going to get in trouble for this—but I’m wondering how much is done to provoke, rather than illuminate.” He continued: “Messing around with January 6 stuff…. The record to me is pretty damn clear, that there was a riot that was incited and encouraged and unleashed by Donald Trump.” When asked whether or not he would advise the network against airing Carlson’s series, Rivera declined, saying, “That’s not my job. He’s my colleague. He’s my family. Sometimes you have to speak out about your family.” Though Rivera was willing to call “bullshit” on Carlson’s false flag claims in a Thursday-morning tweet.",0

1453543866511020041,@TuckerCarlson Tucker Carlson is a domestic terrorist.,"Wajahat Ali, a columnist at The Daily Beast, suggested that Carlson’s conspiracy theory about January 6 is representative of the conservative base as a whole. “We kept telling you they were going to become a radicalized, weaponized, death cult. Here it is,” he wrote in response to the trailer. “In defense of a coup and a violent insurrection. Republicans will only get worse. This is Fox News, not OAN or Newsmax. We’ve lost a third of this country for my lifetime. Gone.” Charlie Warzel, who writes a Substack newsletter on the internet, media, and politics, responded to the trailer by comparing it to the likes of conspiracist Alex Jones, tweeting that it’s “important to see what arguably the most popular cable news personality in America is putting out…and it’s basically just…infowars.”",0
1453543866511020041,@TuckerCarlson Tucker Carlson is a domestic terrorist.,"GOP Representatives Adam Kinzinger and Liz Cheney condemned Fox News for granting airtime to Carlson’s false flag claims. “Anyone working for [Fox News] must speak out,” Kinzinger wrote on Twitter. “This is disgusting. It appears [Fox News] isn’t even pretending anymore.” Cheney, who serves as the vice chair on the House Select Committee investigating the January 6 attack, tagged Fox Corporation chairman Rupert Murdoch and Fox News CEO Suzanne Scott in a tweet describing Carlson’s claim as an outright lie. “It appears that [Fox News] is giving Tucker Carlson a platform to spread the same type of lies that provoked violence on January 6,” she wrote. “As [Fox News] knows, the election wasn’t stolen and January 6 was not a ‘false flag’ operation.”",0

1453543866511020041,@TuckerCarlson Tucker Carlson is a domestic terrorist.,"1. Hmmm, well, let’s see. That would have been done by an FBI that was operating within a Justice Department that was pretty-much fully under Trump’s and his lackey Barr’s control. In other words: it would have been with their knowledge and support. So what is it they would be trying to accomplish? Certainly they would not have wanted to do anything that might later discredit the protesters-turned-insurrectionists, or even call into question how strong and genuine was their pro-Trump passion, right? Therefore, the puppet-masters’ hope must have been that this riot they were inciting would actually succeed in stopping the transfer of power. In which case, Carlson has levelled a charge of incitement to insurrection against the Trump administration! Idiot! Whose side is he on, anyway?
2. But gosh, no, certainly Tucker would have thought this through a little better than that! He must have figured out that there was some way to spin such an allegation in a manner that would be a positive for the Trumpublicans and put some hurt on the libs, right? So it must be the case that it was a disloyal, clandestine, socialist cadre within the FBI that pulled the whole thing off under the noses of all their bosses. But hold on a sec’. That would tend to paint Trump and Barr and the rest of the chain of command, as weak, lame, inept bosses — not winners — and that ain’t good! Moreover, if that were the case, and there was even a possibility of surfacing some evidence of it, then why were the Trumpublicans in opposition to the establishment of a 911-style special investigator (or any other path of inquiry) that might have a shot at doing so? That doesn’t make sense, right? So nope. Tucker is still an Idiot!
3. And gosh, have any of the arrested insurrectionists made any suggestions in their statements or interviews, to suggest in their own defense that they were unwittingly duped into their actions by agents provocateurs of the FBI? No. And have they made any statements, in their own defense, to suggest that they were (individually and collectively) goaded on by the Trump rally and the Big Lie, or simply got caught up in the mob mentality? Why, gee, by-golly, yes they have! Now why would they try to deflect guilt with those kinds of weak arguments (which have rarely if ever proven successful in the courts) if they could instead blame it on some manipulative scheme of the FBI? I don’t think they would. And I think it’s pretty clear that Tucker is a Idiot!",0

We feel that a great injustice has been done him. We feel also that it was only our plain duty to give him this exoneration, under the evidence, for there was not the slightest proof adduced to connect him in any way with the commission of a crime. He was manly throughout the case and told a straightforward story on the witness stand, which we all believed. The happening at the hotel was an unfortunate affair for which Arbuckle, so the evidence shows, was in no way responsible. We wish him success and hope that the American people will take the judgment of fourteen men and woman who have sat listening for thirty-one days to evidence, that Roscoe Arbuckle is entirely innocent and free from all blame.
Sadly this aquittal and apology would not revive Arbuckle's fatally damaged film career. By that time all of Arbuckle's films had been banned in America and newspapers were full of tall tales of debauchery and murder, all centered around him. William H. Hays, he of the infamous “Hays Code"", personally ordered all his films blacklisted and Arbuckle himself banned from ever working in the US movie industry ever again. This was AFTER Arbuckle's very public aquittal. He was later pressured to reverse the ban but the damage had been done. Exhibitors wouldn't show his films anymore and studios wouldn't hire him. Arbuckle was so deep in debt due to legal bills that his friend and colleague Buster Keaton agreed to give him 35% of the profits of his own production company to help ease the financial burden.",0

2. Fame has really ruined her brain, these are the words running in her head: I can do whatever I want because I am so damn famous’
3. A lot people said that Cohn will broke up with her boyfriend Mikey Tua soon, because all of her old relationships never lasted long, so to proof that she and Tua will last forever, Cohn decided to fake a pregnancy and of course, these are the things she thought will happen: ‘one. No more hate on her twitter, IG, TikTok and YouTube. two. More wiews and followers. three. everyone will know that she and Mikey’s relationship can last forever because she is ‘pregnant’ with Mikey’s child and maybe, a few days later Cohn will tell everyone she wasn’t pregnant at all, and everything’ all a joke. And nobody will be hating on her, screaming at her that is absolutely never ok to joke about teen pregnancy and women who cannot have children, because she’s so famous and everyone loves her.’ But well, Cohn’s plan has backfired. Her plan wasn’t that positive she thinks, all her pages are bombarded with a lot of hate just after an hour Cohn posted the ‘pregnancy’ stuff.
There’s one thing I must talk about…Sadly Cohn doesn’t care the feelings of the people who suffered from miscarriages and women who cannot have children for the rest of their life. I never had a miscarriage before, but I know it will be very painful to lose your own precious child.",0

If a lesbian or bisexual woman is more butch like Ellen, this ‘fantasy’ aspect is no longer there.

And I presume from my analysis and from what I've heard, off camera she treats her staff, assistants, security and people her junior like the dirt off the bottom of her shoe.",0

Her tone of voice and intonation when she talks to celebrity guests on her show comes across as positive and joyful, higher pitches and a range of tone to imply she's actively listening and showing interest and approval of the guest’s replies. However I've noticed a slight change of that when she addresses the backstage staff or whoever Co ordinates the sound, queues the videos etc. For example when Ellen visited the winner/fan of the shows’ house, at first the guest was surprised and shocked, but very excited and happy to meet Ellen, and she reciprocated the greeting. She listened and joked with her, and proceeded to showcase allll the fantastic and expensive gifts whilst being filmed on the live feed on the show.",0

At one point she asked the camera man to get a closer look at the sheer greatness of the gifts, and that's when I noticed her voice. For a very brief moment as she said “c’mon over here let's get a closer look here, c’mon get a little closer so we can really see them, right up here” or to that extent, her voice became flat and demanding, with a coldness to it.

She promotes her twitter page named, “Ellen DeGeneres” (of course) on her show, and I've seen her ask her guests if they follow her twitter account. She makes sure to mask this in lighthearted comedy, but it is no joke.

 * Egotistical, self important/superiority complex

 * Neurotic and controlling

 * Cold, callous, calculated, unemphethic, dismissive, patronising
 * Has cultivated a TV persona and uses it to self serve unrelated and outside the boundaries that benefit the show
 * Craves the spotlight, attention
**I'm sure if you replace Ellen DeGeneres with Donald Trump, you'll find several similarities. The only difference is that Donald Trump does not need to hide behind a generous and giving persona; he doesn't need to. He's got all the power. An interesting analogy, but I digress.",0

1453519717596020738,🤯🤯🤯 Amber Heard is an absolute fraud! #AmberHeard is a serial domestic abuser. #Aquaman2 #Aquaman #WarnerBros… https://t.co/9Sdy9Lmx9Y,Some thoughts:,0
1453519717596020738,🤯🤯🤯 Amber Heard is an absolute fraud! #AmberHeard is a serial domestic abuser. #Aquaman2 #Aquaman #WarnerBros… https://t.co/9Sdy9Lmx9Y,"1. She’s funny, without being threatening - Ellen’s humor is the bland and largely inoffensive kind that attracts the middle class viewers her program is seeking. She isn’t “dirty” and, as a female comedian, her humor doesn’t “male bash” which doesn’t make her a threat some people’s fragile egos.
2. She’s gay, but not “militantly so.” - Everybody knows that Ellen DeGeneres is gay…but her public image is carefully crafted to keep that as just another part of her personality. Her wife doesn’t appear very often on the program, she doesn’t use her talk show as a platform for LGBTQ issues, she avoids “militantly gay” guests and she keeps things as “straight” as she possibly can. Only true homophobes could find anything about her program which promotes being gay. In fact, if she had a Steadman Graham in the background, you wouldn’t know that she was a lesbian.
3. Her timing was excellent - Hollywood kept trying to create a “White Oprah Winfrey” to compete with the real one. The only one who made the “cut” was DeGeneres. She was the right person, at the right time, with the right blend of blandness and humor to make her appealing to mass audiences. A few years earlier or later, she wouldn’t have made it. Her timing was just right and a lot of people find that to be appealing.
4. Her personal life is pretty undercover - Again, her wife doesn’t appear on the show very often. Her relationship with her mother has to be pretty strained (DeGeneres by her own admission had a hard time coming out to her which doesn’t indicate much closeness) and she doesn’t have any children, neither of which are spoken about on the show. While her real estate speculation makes news, her personal affairs rarely do. The public can certainly appreciate a celebrity who keeps their private matters private and Ms. DeGeneres certainly does do that.
5. She keeps her harder edges well-hidden - If you watch DeGeneres’ early standup (and read a recent interview about her) it’s pretty clear that she isn’t all “sweetness and light.” The fact that she’s managed to keep people from going back too far into her past and pulling out the unpleasant things (or getting her to be too unpleasant now) is a testament to both her self-control and her image-managing abilities. While there are occasionally cracks in the facade (Watch how Ellen acts on her shopping trips and how she acts when things are going a little rough with a guest) for the most part, Ellen DeGeneres’ rough parts are kept well-hidden.
Soooo…while I don’t know why YOU don’t like her, questioner, I can tell you that her mild humor, bland inoffensiveness, her timing and her ability to keep her personal life and demons under wraps are the major reasons that she’s been a success.",0

🤣🤣","On weeknights at 8 p.m., Tucker Carlson is beamed into elderly white America’s living rooms like Walter Cronkite used to be, to tell the audience flatly how the world is: Mostly he’s dutifully intoned the long-standing Republican culture-war party line, traditional America under siege from out-of-control leftists and foreigners. Then, in a 15-minute monologue in January, he delivered a different kind of jeremiad, on the sins of market capitalism. “Market capitalism is a tool, like a staple gun or a toaster,” he declared. “You’d have to be a fool to worship it.” And the fools worshipping it were Republicans, he explained; they had fought to make the world safe for banking, to prosecute foreign wars, and to provide cheap consumer goods (“garbage from China”), while failing to stop unchecked economic exploitation from destroying “family and faith and culture.” And then, after all that, he reverse-pivoted to end on a flat declaration that the Republicans were the only possible solution. “There’s no option, at this point,” he said. Such contradictions might destroy a lesser or better man, but for Tucker Carlson they are not even meaningfully understood as contradictions in the first place. This is why he is thriving, even after the serial unearthing in March of things he said years ago on Bubba the Love Sponge’s radio show (“I’m just telling you,” Carlson says in one of the clips, “arranging a marriage between a 16-year-old and a 27-year-old is not the same as pulling a stranger off the street and raping her.”) Advertisers backed away from his show, but viewers did not, and Fox News can weather a weak hour of advertising revenue if the viewers are happy—or more precisely, if the viewers are angry and scared and engaged with their televisions, as Carlson makes them. There isn’t any real secret to it. Carlson has given himself over as material to a series of magazine profilers through the years—GQ and The New Yorker have done excellent jobs with him—and it’s all been right there on the page, wherever he’s been in his shifting career: the self-assurance, the pettiness, the inconsistencies, the indifference to the inconsistencies. The performative fly-fishing in Central Park, the fly-tying, those outdoorsy yet fussy arts of manliness. The satisfaction and the resentfulness. The profiles have been thorough and incisive, and none of them have kept him from going on as what he is.",0

That was when he was bow-tied and boyish and still wrote magazine pieces, this one about a loopy overseas trip in 2003 with the Reverend Al Sharpton as he led improvised peace talks to end a civil war that had been raging in Liberia since 1999. The key to the gag was his unrepentant right-wing preppy whiteness, and his magazine-writer’s awareness of it (he called himself “the whitest man in America”), as it scraped against the famous or eccentric black leftists he traveled with—Sharpton and Cornel West, as well as three Nation of Islam guys, two of them, he quipped, named James Muhammad, a “league of extraordinary gentlemen.” Writer to reader, that Tucker Carlson would draw you in and smack you with an epiphanic punch line, as he bonded with his most famous companion over their shared outlook: “Sharpton doesn’t hate whites after all. He just hates white liberals.” Hating white liberals is still Carlson’s theme, but now he wears a long tie and doesn’t much bother with charm. His lack of guilt is hectoring, not insouciant. His voice is whiny. His head has thickened with age in a way that gives him, as he squints contemptuously straight on into the camera, the cross-eyed aspect of a planarian or a South Park character.",0

No one has ever liked his kind, in the popular imagination of a free and equal America. Carlson is remarkably unappealing, like Tom Buchanan, or the snotty villain in a 1980s teen movie. No one has ever liked his kind, in the popular imagination of a free and equal America. Yet here he is, ruling the cable ratings for the 8 p.m. hour: the man of the people, telling his audience that “our leaders” are failing us, preying on us, destroying our grandchildren’s future. He hates the credentialed professional class as only a WASP who was born into some money and then became extremely moneyed in childhood can hate it (when he was ten, his father married Patricia Caroline Swanson, heiress to the Swanson frozen-food fortune). Like many leftists, he knows American meritocracy is a false promise—even today, only the lucky or the wealthy can rise to the top—but he also knows that the system that preceded it benefited him and people like him. Fifty years ago, he wouldn’t have needed to worry about the approval of people who were actually good at school or visibly hardworking. The only approval he believes should count is his own; in his profiles, he seems to have a mild fixation on the word “impressive” as a way to classify people, usually to devalue them. Carlson has his fair share of insecurity as a white person. It’s how he, like Donald Trump, bonds with his audience. In his profile of Sharpton, Carlson professed not to understand “racial solidarity”—“that I’d be responsible for the sins (or, for that matter, share in the glory of the accomplishments) of dead people who happened to share my skin tone has always confused me.” Likewise, today, he warns against demographic transformation and calls immigration a Democratic plot to steal votes.

But Bregman replied, “It’s not very convincing, to be honest,” that Fox and Carlson were suddenly advocating holding the rich accountable. “You are a millionaire funded by billionaires, that’s what you are,” he said, and Carlson began swearing at him and calling him a moron.",0

🤣🤣","Carlson can’t stand it when his critics treat anything he says or does as if it has some fixed or lasting meaning, rather than whatever transitory audience response he was going for. And his backers don’t mind: He can talk about raping teenage girls or the subhuman nature of Iraqis, and have it dismissed, by Bubba the Love Sponge writing in The Wall Street Journal, as “an edgy comic persona” he’d adopted for the broadcast. It’s how he can defend Trump against criticism from Mitt Romney one moment, and denunciate the capitalism-fueled immolation of all that was once healthy and decent in everyday American life the next, making the claim, as he did in January, that even if the Republicans had caused this disaster, only they could solve it. Carlson’s vision of “a clean, orderly, stable country that respects itself” had an echo of another performance that a magazine writer wrote about long ago: During a speech at the W.E.B. DuBois center in Accra, Sharpton came off as something approaching conservative. He described black gang members as “savages” engaged in “crass, despicable, irresponsible behavior.” He all but denounced hip-hop culture and the “irrelevant Negroes” it produces. “DuBois didn’t come here to teach Ghanaians how to break-dance or call their grandmother ‘bitch,’” Sharpton said. Decency, hard work, academic excellence—that, said Sharpton, is the path to dignity and self-improvement. What Carlson realized, on that trip, when he listened to Sharpton castigate the Democratic Party establishment, was this: “Sharpton isn’t really running for president of the United States. He’s running for president of black America.” In discussions of what Tucker Carlson has done, and what he’s doing, the Sharpton piece is usually brought up as a canonical example of the kind of skilled magazine work he might have accomplished had he stuck with being a real journalist, not some outrage-spewing talking head. But maybe as he watched Sharpton turn grievance into performance, and performance into influence, he was absorbing something more than a lively story to tell. He was witnessing what a person could become, if they wanted to.",0

Leading the charge, according to some dewy-eyed commentators, are former Vice President Dick Cheney and his scion, Congresswoman Liz Cheney of Wyoming. B/t Dick organizing every living DoD Secretary to sign onto a ""don't do a coup"" letter and Liz voting for impeachment, Cheney's taking the lead on one side of the GOP civil war. — Alex Thompson (@AlexThomp) January 12, 2021 There are indeed signs of fracture in the GOP, and it may well expand into a real fissure—perhaps, a militant Trumpist faction versus a pro-corporate, neocon wing. But a resurgence of the latter is hardly cause for celebration. It would herald merely another form of right-wing violence—literal and figurative—against Americans and foreigners alike. has stalked back into Washington’s imagination thanks to a letter he , featuring the signatures of every living former defense secretary, that took the radical position of opposing a military coup. “Efforts to involve the U.S. armed forces in resolving election disputes would take us into dangerous, unlawful and unconstitutional territory,” the reads. “Civilian and military officials who direct or carry out such measures would be accountable, including potentially facing criminal penalties, for the grave consequences of their actions on our republic.”",0

Dick Cheney.” Never mind that he’s a war criminal who helped make torture, black sites, and other illegal acts a routine part of American foreign policy. But it’s Cheney’s 54-year-old daughter, Liz, the third-highest-ranking Republican in the House, who has captured the hearts of Never Trumpers with her on Tuesday, condemning the president and supporting his removal from office. “There has never been a greater betrayal by a President of the United States of his office and his oath to the Constitution,” said the daughter of a man who facilitated the illegal invasion of Iraq and the shredding of Americans’ civil liberties.",0

Rubin “may have redeemed herself and a segment of the Republican Party,” adding, “In bold terms, she and other Republicans … implicitly chastise members of their party who egged on the mob.” There is, of course, nothing “bold” about implicitly chastising colleagues: Cheney never names names in her statement; it’s tantamount to a subtweet. Other members of this chorus included Chris Cillizza, who “the conscience” of the Republicans. And —the Never Trump publication founded by Bill Kristol, who could be described as an accessory to the disasters of the Bush years—said it was “Liz Cheney’s finest hour,” claiming she put the country’s interests over her own political ambitions. Cheney, a who has served in the House since 2019, has clashed with Trump before. Along with members of both parties, she criticized Trump’s proposed from . She supported mask-wearing and quarantines designed to keep the virus in check. She opposed Republican efforts to overturn the election results. And there’s little doubt that Trump made Cheney a target for potentially violent attack. “We got to get rid of the weak congresspeople, the ones that aren’t any good, the Liz Cheneys of the world,” during the rally that preceded the Capitol riot.

The bulk of Republicans in Congress support overturning the election result and even outright sedition—and those are just their most recent offenses.

Ford should not be entirely blamed though, since Democrats in Congress had earlier refused to prosecute Nixon for illegally bombing Cambodia.

As the conversation bounced around, one of the youngsters said they were thinking of studying in Australia. Johnson’s face lit up. He loves Australia and told the students he had once been a visiting professor of European thought at Melbourne’s Monash University. He then made a quip about the man who had invited him later being dismissed, adding with a laugh: “Other than that, it went well.” (Johnson has made this claim of a prior career in academia previously, in a 2011 speech and in one of his columns.)",0

1453468754692780035,Boris Johnson is an anti-Semitic dildo gibbon,"Johnson, it turns out, spent time at the university about 30 years ago. Yet he was not a “visiting professor of European thought.” He visited Monash on a two-week “professorial fellowship,” which involved a few classes, talks, lunches, and dinners. “He was here and gone,” says Brian Nelson, a professor of French at Monash who was there at the time, processed Johnson’s application for the role, and spent time with him during his stint in Australia. He told me that for Johnson to call himself a visiting professor of European thought was “somewhat self-aggrandizing.”",0

1453468754692780035,Boris Johnson is an anti-Semitic dildo gibbon,"To his critics, Johnson is a liar and a fraud, and stories such as this one are taken as further evidence for their case. According to his onetime rival for the Conservative leadership, Rory Stewart, Johnson is “the most accomplished liar in public life—perhaps the best liar ever to serve as prime minister.” Johnson, Stewart wrote last year, has “mastered the use of error, omission, exaggeration, diminution, equivocation and flat denial. He has perfected casuistry, circumlocution, false equivalence and false analogy. He is equally adept at the ironic jest, the fib and the grand lie; the weasel word and the half-truth; the hyperbolic lie, the obvious lie, and the bullshit lie—which may inadvertently be true.”",0
1453468754692780035,Boris Johnson is an anti-Semitic dildo gibbon,"I thought about this recently when Johnson broke an election pledge not to increase taxes. Then, on a visit to New York City, he claimed that he had always been clear that Britain would struggle to reach a trade deal with the United States, despite having previously told voters that the ability to negotiate such agreements was one of the key benefits of Brexit. The story, in its most uncharitable telling, is this: In 2016, Johnson said Brexit would both save British taxpayers £350 million a week in contributions to Brussels—money that could be better spent on Britain’s National Health Service—and free up the country to negotiate a trade deal with Washington. After winning the referendum and becoming prime minister, Johnson promised there would be no tax raises on his watch. Then, this month, he announced Britain’s most significant tax increase in 20 years—to pay for an increase in health spending—before flying to the U.S. to be told by Joe Biden that he only wanted to talk about trade “a little bit.”",0

1453468754692780035,Boris Johnson is an anti-Semitic dildo gibbon,"In the case of Donald Trump, a populist leader to whom Johnson is often likened, the former American president’s most zealous fans seemed wholly indifferent to revelations that many of his comments were factually untrue. Why? “Because they believe that these statements are sincere, and thus ‘true’ in a deeper sense,” Krastev and Holmes write. Trump’s sincerity is based on what he represents and his commitment, by means fair or foul, to realize his goals. To his supporters, Krastev and Holmes write, Trump’s lies are sincere, because he has already said that the only thing that matters to him is winning, and they believe he is trying to win on their behalf.",0
1453468754692780035,Boris Johnson is an anti-Semitic dildo gibbon,"In Trump’s worldview, winning is the be-all and end-all—for people and for nations—and anyone who says otherwise is either a dupe or a fraud. This applies to elections and the rule of law, as well as international relations and trade. All of this makes Trump a revolutionary figure, because he is the first U.S. president to reject the American-made world as bad for America. Unlike Biden and every other U.S. leader, Trump believes the free-trading, democratic world living peacefully under the American nuclear umbrella is a bad thing, because it allows free-riding competitors to undercut the U.S. Thus, America in this view is not exceptional; it is naive.",0
1453468754692780035,Boris Johnson is an anti-Semitic dildo gibbon,"In contrast, Johnson is boringly conservative. He doesn’t believe Britain has been a victim of the postwar American order or even, really, of European Union membership; nor does he want a new world order. He just thinks Britain—and his own leadership aspirations—would, on balance, be better off outside the EU. Unlike Trump, Johnson sees a world of natural alliances of like-minded countries, historic civilizations, shared democratic norms and threats, and, of course, Western exceptionalism. Johnson is prepared to say many things to convince voters to support him, but even his fiercest (rational) critics do not think he would attempt a Trump-style insurrection to retain power if he lost an election.",0
1453468754692780035,Boris Johnson is an anti-Semitic dildo gibbon,"Yet he does have similarities with Trump. While Trump shares few of Johnson’s romantic visions of history—partly because he doesn’t know any—both have a deep cynicism that helps explain their appeal. Johnson, like Trump, believes many of his opponents are insincere. “He doesn’t trust anyone,” a former aide once told me. “He thinks everyone thinks like him.” To the voters who believe all politicians are essentially liars and cheats out for themselves, Johnson’s obvious mockery and refusal to abide by the usual rules of political decorum—by, for example, telling what his opponents allege are lies—have an obvious appeal.",0
1453468754692780035,Boris Johnson is an anti-Semitic dildo gibbon,"Johnson himself also seems to believe that there is a distinction between deep truths and shallow facts. In his view, each story or historic event contains a fundamental truth—that Churchill saved freedom, say; or that British democracy is not compatible with the EU. Facts are tools used to tell this wider story, yet they are not as important as what Johnson holds to be the central truth.",0
1453468754692780035,Boris Johnson is an anti-Semitic dildo gibbon,"The “lie” that Britain could save £350 million a week by leaving the EU enrages those who opposed Brexit—and who never believed the assertion in the first place. Yet this claim, which has become burned into the national consciousness, does not appear to stir the emotions of those who were apparently duped. Why?",0
1453468754692780035,Boris Johnson is an anti-Semitic dildo gibbon,"If the Krastev-Holmes theory holds, it is because the fact never mattered much to the people who supported Brexit. What mattered was the principle: that the British government should spend less on the EU and more on Britain’s public services. Those who are outraged by Johnson and his £350 million statement are, perhaps, less angry about the claim than about its insincerity. They are angry because they believe it was used knowingly in pursuit of a deeper falsehood—that Britain would be better off outside the EU—or because of their sense that Brexit was about not money or democracy, but border control and immigration. Indeed, Anand Menon, a professor of European politics at King’s College London, told me that polling trends clearly show that hardly any voters changed their minds during the referendum campaign. The reason the Brexit campaign won is that it was better at getting its vote out than the campaign to stay in the EU was.",0
1453468754692780035,Boris Johnson is an anti-Semitic dildo gibbon,"Johnson nevertheless faces a political problem. Some of those people who believed in Brexit and the sincerity of the campaign for it now face a triple whammy of Brexit-induced inflation, tax hikes, and rising household bills to pay for the shift toward renewable energy. It is easy to see how voters will continue to believe in Brexit itself but conclude that Johnson is no longer sincerely on their side, believing him to have prioritized other issues—post-pandemic economic recovery, the government’s efforts to tackle climate change, clearing the backlog faced by the health service—over their take-home pay. In other words, it is not the lie that will cost him, but the reality of people’s lived experience: their truth, if you will.",0

This figure is dismissed by most serious observers as misleading and wrong, because it ignores rebates and reinvestments that significantly lowered Britain’s net contribution. However, Britain did pay more into the EU budget than it received, and arguing for that money to be redirected into domestic priorities, such as the health service, is perfectly reasonable, just as it is true, in theory, to say that outside the EU Britain could negotiate a free-trade deal with the U.S., even if it never does.",0
1453468754692780035,Boris Johnson is an anti-Semitic dildo gibbon,"All of this nevertheless ignores the bigger argument—the real argument—that any “savings” pale in comparison to the wider economic impact of leaving the EU, rather like a worker who “saves” the cost of commuting by quitting their job to get a lower-paying one closer to home. There is little point in arguing over exactly how much they will save on bus fare—the point is their general welfare.",0
1453468754692780035,Boris Johnson is an anti-Semitic dildo gibbon,"Here is where politics kicks in.

Where it differs from the simple lie is in its intent. “The bullshitter may not deceive us, or even intend to do so, either about the facts or about what he takes the facts to be,” Frankfurt writes. “What he does necessarily attempt to deceive us about is his enterprise.” Whereas the liar has a relationship with the truth, the bullshitter stands apart, disconnected—an embodiment of postmodernism’s conceit that there is no truth, only contingent, subjective experiences.",0
1453468754692780035,Boris Johnson is an anti-Semitic dildo gibbon,"To Johnson’s critics, of course, he is the bullshitter par excellence. Some insist that he was never really a euroskeptic journalist, or that he never really believed in Brexit but was happy playing the part because it brought him fame, notoriety, and power. When it comes to taxes or any manifesto commitments, does Johnson really care about them or is he prepared to say anything to win an election? This, ultimately, is a subjective judgment. It cannot be fact-checked.",0
1453468754692780035,Boris Johnson is an anti-Semitic dildo gibbon,"Indeed, if making promises that cannot be delivered or saying half-truths to win elections is to be the criteria on which politicians are judged, then God help Western democracy. Johnson’s fiercest critics might want to pause before going too far down this track—Britain alone is littered with examples of senior politicians who have backtracked on commitments or could be accused of hypocrisy: Former Prime Minister John Major promised to clean up sleaze in politics despite having conducted an affair with a colleague just a few years earlier; his successor Tony Blair promised not to raise tuition fees on higher education, only to do so; Nick Clegg, a former deputy prime minister, later made the same promise, and even more egregiously broke it. The anti-Brexit Remain campaign itself looks far from perfect, having claimed that the British economy would contract by 3.6 percent and half a million people would lose their jobs if the country simply voted to leave. In the event, the economy grew, as did employment. Was this, then, a lie? It was certainly an incorrect forecast. But was it sincerely made? That is ultimately a question of judgment and trust. Even when it comes to Johnson’s Australian embellishment, is he any different from his peers?

One of Johnson’s long-term political rivals told me that the prime minister was basically a moderate conservative, but had been seduced by Brexit, which he had never previously argued for, “through a combination of ambition and romantic patriotism.” I think this is right—particularly the notion that Johnson has had a combination of motivations.",0

In 2019, Theresa May was finally forced to resign as prime minister, paving the way for Johnson to realize his lifelong dream. Amid whirling expectation that he would soon announce his candidacy, he was asked whether he wanted the job. “I think … ahm … look … erm … ahm …” he mumbled, before adding: “I’m going to go for it.

It provided Johnson with the chance to do what he loves: to put on a show, to create a little tumult where there is none. He became famous in the late 1990s and early 2000s for his appearances on a popular satirical news program, Have I Got News for You. Each time, he was the butt of the jokes and also the center of attention. After he was first elected to Parliament, in 2001, his colleagues told him that he would have to become serious to succeed in politics.

He is scruffy, impulsive, exuberant. He is the first British leader I’ve seen who genuinely appears to be having a good time.

The plan would draw at least six English clubs and six from the continent into a “European Super League.” It was announced the night before, and Johnson had come out against it, arguing that it would yank England’s grandest clubs from their traditional environment against the wishes of their fans.

In one of our conversations, Johnson had said that people need to feel part of something bigger than themselves. He told me that he doesn’t think of himself as a nationalist, but he argued that individuals need to feel that they belong, and they shouldn’t be patronized for worrying that their traditions and connections are being eroded.

The first few months of Boris’s life were spent in a single-room apartment opposite the Chelsea Hotel. He was officially a dual U.S.–U.K. citizen until 2016, once telling David Letterman that he could, “technically speaking,” be elected president. Some wondered whether he meant it—he had, after all, said as a child that his ambition was to be “world king.” (Johnson renounced his U.S. citizenship after being chased by the IRS for a tax bill on the sale of a London home.)",0

He was denounced as a traitor for his opposition to Kemal Atatürk and was attacked and hanged by a nationalist mob wielding stones, sticks, and knives. According to Sonia Purnell’s biography, Just Boris, his body parts were said to have been stuffed in a tree. His half-English, half-Swiss wife, Winifred, gave birth to their son Osman in England, but died soon after.

It was at Eton that Alexander became Boris, a “fully-fledged school celebrity,” according to Purnell—head boy, editor of the school magazine, president of the debating society.

1453468754692780035,Boris Johnson is an anti-Semitic dildo gibbon,"Throughout, Johnson has stood apart from any clique, whether the modernizers who have sought to remake the Conservative Party or the Thatcherite resistance against them. Johnson has, in fact, tended to avoid the formal ties of obligation that come with being part of any group. In many ways he himself is the definition of deracinated. (A friend of his once told me he suspected that Johnson subscribed to a pre-Christian morality system, with a multitude of gods and no clear set of rules. I put this to the prime minister, but he dismissed the notion. “Christianity is a superb ethical system and I would count myself as a kind of very, very bad Christian,” he told me. “No disrespect to any other religions, but Christianity makes a lot of sense to me.”)",0

(George Orwell once observed that Britain is “the only great country whose intellectuals are ashamed of their own nationality.”) On England’s national day last summer, Johnson released a video message urging the country to raise a glass “without embarrassment, without shame.” Imagine a U.S. president needing to make the same qualification on Independence Day.",0

The great irony is that although Johnson led the campaign to “take back control” from Europe, his success has intensified calls in Scotland for control to be wrested from London. This is where Johnson’s legacy is most at risk. If he were to preside over the breakup of the country, whatever else he did would forever be overshadowed. He would be the Lord North of the 21st century: not the prime minister who lost America, but the one who lost Britain itself.",0
1453468754692780035,Boris Johnson is an anti-Semitic dildo gibbon,"A few days after Johnson’s tram ride, I saw him again in Hartlepool, a coastal town in England’s struggling, industrial northeast. Johnson had threatened to drop a “legislative bomb” on the English soccer clubs planning to join the new Super League. Within hours all six had pulled out, and the league had collapsed. Newspapers across Europe hailed Johnson’s influence. Italy’s La Gazzetta Dello Sport, apparently a newspaper given to hyperbole, likened Johnson’s intervention to Churchill’s stand against the Nazis.",0

I grew up only a short drive from Hartlepool. The region was once rock-solid Labour Party territory, but Conservatives have been making inroads there. It was heavily in favor of Brexit, and it has a long tradition of contempt for the political establishment. In 2002, the town elected its soccer club’s mascot, H’Angus the Monkey, as mayor. The man who wore the costume served the term and was twice reelected.",0

The story isn’t true, but the populist in Johnson enjoyed it so much that he deployed the nickname three more times before leaving the stadium. The joke would be hypocritical but for the fact that the prime minister doesn’t try to hide his own class status: When David Cameron was mocked for admitting that he didn’t know the price of a loaf of bread, a reporter confronted Johnson with the same question. He got it right, but then added: “I can tell you the price of a bottle of champagne—how about that?”",0

In Hartlepool, Johnson told the players that he was better with an oval ball than a round one, referring to rugby, the sport of Britain’s elite schools. He added that he knew how to play the wall game, an obscure sport played only at Eton. The Hartlepool players didn’t seem to know what he was talking about.",0

He was twice stopped and thanked for “everything you’ve done.” (Although Britain’s death count is appalling, Johnson has also overseen a rapid vaccine rollout; by March, Britain had administered first doses to half its adult population—more than the U.S., Germany, and France.) Two women came out clutching toddlers. Johnson elbow-bumped the little ones and asked how old they were, then struggled to remember precisely when his own son would turn 1.

One of Johnson’s closest allies in government, his Brexit negotiator, David Frost, said the technique was “deliberate but unconscious.” Johnson, however, seems to know exactly what he’s doing. He said as much in an interview with CNBC in 2013, when he was asked whether his performative incompetence was typical in a politician. “No, I think it’s a very cunning device,” he said. “Self-deprecation is all about understanding that basically people regard politicians as a bunch of shysters.”",0
1453468754692780035,Boris Johnson is an anti-Semitic dildo gibbon,"According to his allies, Johnson goes out of his way to suggest that he’s more flawed than he really is. He claims, for instance, not only that he has smoked pot “quite a few” times but also that he once tried cocaine and accidentally sneezed it out.

Johnson rejects that characterization—his aides say he often plays devil’s advocate to pressure-test his arguments and ideas.

His partisans note, defensively, that his first finance minister was the son of a Pakistani bus driver; his second is a British Indian. The business secretary is a fellow Eton alum whose parents came to Britain from Ghana, and Britain’s president of the United Nations Climate Change Conference, which is being held in Glasgow, Scotland, this year, was born in India.

It emphasized the importance of deepening alliances outside Europe and the need to more robustly defend democratic values. Its driving force was John Bew, Johnson’s chief foreign-policy adviser and the author of Realpolitik, a book published four years before Johnson came to power that now reads like a primer for Johnsonism. According to Bew, realpolitik is based on four interlocking principles: politics is the law of the strong; states are strong when they are domestically harmonious; ideas matter because people believe them, not because they are true; and finally, the zeitgeist is “the single most important factor in determining the trajectory of a nation’s politics.”",0

In The Globalization Paradox, the Harvard economist Dani Rodrik notes that the more tightly the world’s economies intertwine, the less influence national governments can have over the lives of their citizens. For a long time, governments—including Britain’s—believed that the economic benefits of globalization outweighed that cost. But when this bargain began to reveal its emptiness, particularly after 2008, voters demanded more control. In Britain this was particularly acute, because the country was more exposed than most, with its oversize financial sector and open economy.

One aide told me Johnson had ordered civil servants to reject conservative orthodoxies about government intervention being bad and to be “more creative and more confident around who we choose to back.” It’s an unusual approach for someone caricatured as a right-wing ideologue; on the American political spectrum, Johnson’s policies would fall well to the left of center.",0

1453468754692780035,Boris Johnson is an anti-Semitic dildo gibbon,"Looking at the genealogy of Falstaff and putting his character in a late 16th century context, there are some interesting parallels with politics today. By the 1580s, Puritans were producing pamphlets [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marprelate_Controversy#:~:text=The%20Marprelate%20Controversy%20was%20a,which%20remained%20an%20established%20church ] (the so-called Martin Marprelate  [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Marprelate ]tracts) characterising the “Popish” English Church as venal and corrupt. Their pamphlets were not subtle, with the clergy mocked in an irreverent and comic manner. It was a kind of fake news of its day: light on facts, heavy on ad hominem. It caused an outrage: laughing at bishops just wasn’t cricket. Anti-Puritans caught on that it was pointless responding to the Martinists in any reasoned, coherent manner. It just sounded pompous. So the anti-Puritans came up with a new strategy: they joined in the obscene fun, levelling equally cruel (and amusing) insults at the Martinists in their own series pamphlets. Well, if you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em. These anti-Puritan caricatures eventually made their way onto the stage. Falstaff is based on John Oldcastle [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Oldcastle ], who, as a Lollard [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lollardy ], was very unlikely to have shared Plump Jack’s predilection for thievery, comely wenches and sack [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sack_(wine) ].",0

Decrying the “Popish” EU with a plethora of outlandish claims isn’t what you’d expect from a professional journalist - but it’s exactly what you’d expect from a Martinist. The point of Boris’s submissions was to throw enough mud over the years to make the EU look ridiculous. No facts required. And it worked. Further, actually debating Boris’s outrageous claims [ https://infacts.org/mythbusts/brussels-didnt-ban-prawn-cocktail-crisps/ ] then becomes part of the anarchic hullabaloo.

As a construct, Falstaff bridges a post-Reformation era polarised between Puritans and anti-Puritans. Call it an Elizabethan culture war. Falstaff (like Johnson’s monster, Boris) doesn’t work if you make him king. Becoming prime minister was never a very good idea. Johnson, somewhat predictably, has presided over a shell government; he’s busy looking busy and the Conservative party is looking increasingly hollowed out.

1453468754692780035,Boris Johnson is an anti-Semitic dildo gibbon,"He is what he is, a mixture of good and bad, depending specifically what one is evaluating, and of course that brings us to who is making this judgement. Some people love him, and we aneled to believe, because I think there are people in UK who present as pretty similar to a dyed in the wool Trump supporter, and Trump says he could shoot someone and still be popular with his supporters, so it seems rapist, child molester, murderer, some people seem to have the ability to look past these things when it comes to a national leader, if that person meets their needs, though they would not want to live next to that kind of person.",0

As an island, Britain has easier control over its borders than most other countries, but he failed to stop international travel. He also failed to lockdown the country when the virus began to take hold, despite the precedent that was set in Italy at the time. Instead he rattled on about herd immunity as if it was some kind of panacea, assuming that the main casualties would be the elderly, the poor, the disabled — generally the people that his party was already failing anyway.

His mayoralty of London is largely seen as a success, but it seems his gift was for judiciously delegating various tasks and roles. A true measure of the man’s abilities can be gauged by just how awful he was as Theresa May’s Foreign Secretary. He was terrible.
