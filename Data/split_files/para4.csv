Just kidding, her fans are just extremely nosy. In a recent interview with theage.com, Sandra Bullock hinted that the only relationship she’s interested in is with her 3-year-old son. ""He's still very young and one day things could change but right now we have a very busy schedule full of important things to do, like swim class from three to four, and then feeding him takes hours,"" she said. Wait, it takes hours to feed her son? Maybe that’s why she doesn’t have time to date, because she is taking ""hours"" to feed a baby. Is she chewing up his food and regurgitating it back into his mouth? Bullock said because of her busy life style as a single mom and movie star most men wouldn't be interested in dating her anyway. Her latest movie The Heat probably didn't help out much, either. Remember Jessica Simpson? She was that attractive blonde singer who was popular in the early 2000's. No, you’re thinking of Britney Spears…now you’re thinking of Christina Aguilera. Simpson was the blonde singer who also had that reality show where she proved that all the blonde stereotypes were true. Now, do you remember her? Aw, it's not important.",0

How do you win the presidency without knowing that golfing makes you look rich and indifferent? The racist/slumlord/pervert/nudist ex-NBA owner displayed a remarkable lack of power in 2014. He failed to keep his girlfriend from recording him saying a bunch of horrible shit about black people. He failed to keep the NBA from taking over his Los Angeles Clippers. He failed to keep his wife from selling the Clippers to that bald guy from Microsoft. He failed at every attempt to sue his way back into ownership. He failed to win even a shred of our sympathy in a hilariously misguided interview with Anderson Cooper. And the best part is that it all caught him completely off guard. You mean I’m not allowed to be a rich bastard who gets away with everything anymore? That’s not fair!",0

Her father is dead to her even though he raised her well after Saint Doria abandoned her to become a Flight Attendant when she was just 11. Ouch!
2. Meghan has been married TOO MANY TIMES,( reportedly three times), especially for a woman her age. She has also had her share of live-ins and overlapping relationships. She was not monogamous and “does her own thing.” Meghan appears to use her body to get what she wants.
3. Meghan appears to dislike being Black and presents as WASPY as possible. She does not do anything to advance the plight of blacks (to my knowledge). Most black women have not attended elite private schools and hung out on TV sets. All this is owed to her father who she now ignores and disowns, partly due to his current lack of social standing.
4. Meghan declares herself a feminist but actually worked full-time only the years she appeared on SUITS, a gig she landed with a lot of help from her second spouse, Trevor. In the 15 years between graduating from college and marrying Harry, Megs worked about six or seven. Trevor supported her during their time together and her father contributed while she pursued acting gigs. Apparently, her only skill (Legitimate skill, I should say) other than acting, is calligraphy. This does not pay well.
5. Reportedly, Meghan simulated the act of fellatio as well as other lewd sex acts in her infamous career. Sorry, folks, but some of us have standards and this is just not dignified.
6. Meghan made her wedding to Harry all about being black. Again, what has Meghan ever done to benefit black people? I worked like a dog on the Barack Obama campaign and I do not recall Meghan being part of the effort to elect our first bi-racial president. Additionally, there is no report of Meghan ever having dating a black man. Ever.
7. According to sources, MM enlisted her contacts to get a date with Harry. After two dates, the pair spent a week together in Africa. The “No Rules” girl knew exactly how to get what she wanted. (After all this, Meghan states that she did not even know who Harry was on their first date.) Disingenuous? You be the judge.
8. Exactly what did Meghan get? She got a man whose proposals had been turned down twice, dressed as a Nazi and strutted his junk all over Vegas. He was, however, trying to become a better man.
9. This cannot happen because he bought a woman who could be bought. She loves couture, jewelry, private planes and celebrity. She speaks down to staff and disrespects the taxpayers who support her grandiose lifestyle by demanding more, more, more.
10. Meghan is all about Materialism. Anyone who says otherwise is absurd. She is NOT A HUMANITARIAN!!!!!!! She is a fraud and a phony who has brought Harry down to her level. He will become the worst version of himself. She has thrived on creating rifts in his family because she has disavowed her own family, except MODEL MOTHER SAINT DORIA.
11. I will now address issues of jealousy and envy. I have a better education than MM, having been awarded a Ph.D. scholarship to Tufts University. (I completed my Master’s and left due to sexual harassment.) This is factual and well-documented.
12. I have worked as a VP, a Director and a College Professor even though my first home was in a now-gentrified ghetto in the inner city.
13. I left an impressive career to stay home with my son because I am not a fan of nannies unless they are an absolute necessity.
14. I attend rallies to end gun violence. I support progressive politics and have been active in ensuring equal rights for Blacks, women and other minorities: immigrants, gays and transgendered citizens. I firmly believe in equality and would never leave my beautiful country for a feudal system where people curtsy and otherwise degrade and diminish themselves to “Royalty.” My theological principles dictate my ideology. Similarly, I would not give up my religion for any man. Most feminists would not.
15. I am spiritual and give back. I have welcomed at-risk children and drug-dependent lost souls into my home and into my life.
16. Stop assuming that people who reject Meghan’s agenda of entitlement and excess are HATERS. This is simplistic and stupid. I am a highly-evolved and spiritual person. I live a good life. I have worked for everything I have and have never USED any person in my entire life. This is my chosen path. I have been called worse names than anyone has called MM on this site. For the first time in my life, I was called a “CUNT, by a lowlife Quoran. Unacceptable at every level. Do not abuse me because I disapprove of MM, Kim Kardashian and other members of the DIVA Brigade. I call them out for who and what they are and wish them Enlightenment.
17. I never, ever aspired to be Marie Antoinette. Therefore, it is illogical that I would envy MM.",0

Then finally with the royals who, according in her own words and Harry's own words in engagement interview, embraced her and were like a supporting rock, those royals also gave her duchess title after a lot assumed she would get countess instead because Harry is too far from the throne, made a big royal wedding for her after many expected a small one because she's marrying for the second time, and gave her money she wasted on clothes and flights and babyshower, and after that she turns her back and starts trying to smear them.

He is the one to take over the Throne eventually. Thankfully, he has a wonderful wife in Catherine, who suports him and they do genuinely, seem to be a happy and well belanced family. They enjoy life away from the Public Eye, but share precious times with us. They don’t whinge or complain about how hard life is, trying to bring up 3 small children along with their Royal Duties. They simply ‘get on with it’.",0

Harry was already very popular in the UK. He was known a bit as the wild child compared to his more straight-laced, older brother, but he had seemingly calmed down. Many felt sorry for him losing his mother at a delicate age. After two long term girlfriends, the public were happy that he had finally found someone willing to accept his proposal. Meghan was a virtual unknown to the UK. She was on a niche cable show but not an A-list actress. She was accepted and given the benefit of the doubt as Harry’s bride. As she started working within the royal family and the public became better acquainted with Meghan, her popularity went down. Now she’s one of the least popular members of the royal family, and only the disgraced Prince Andrew polls lower. So what happened? Were the people of UK jealous of her marrying a prince? Well that’s doesn’t make sense as she was accepted because she was marrying Harry. Did the people of the UK suddenly become racist? Meghan’s bi-racial background was well-known and lauded when arrived. So neither of these theories pan out. There were some isolated cases of racist comments that came out, but these were condemned by the public at large.",0

People made excuses for everyone, blaming the other party, but most people can see who the common denominator was in every instance.
 * Meghan was revealed to be an extravagant spender, spending more on clothes than any other European royal by a wide margin. Her New York baby shower again gave her some criticism. Baby showers are not a British tradition, and even in America it is seen as something to help out new parents. Someone with Meghan’s means it would definitely seem gauche.
 * Both Harry and Meghan got slapped with the hypocrite label, cautioning others to be concerned about their environmental footprint while taking vacations via private jet.
 * She raised eyebrows at Princess Eugenie’s wedding when she failed to button all of the buttons on her coat, leading to pregnancy speculations during the wedding coverage. She was in fact pregnant at the time, but it was so early in the pregnancy that the coat issue was not needed. Many accused her of stealing attention from the bride and groom.
 * The Oprah interview that Harry and Meghan did further scuttled much of the public support that they had previously had. They came off as untruthful and some of the comments contradicted others in the same interview.

I agree with him on many issues, but you simply cannot blame the left wing of the American political spectrum for partisan divisions when you’ve been stoking them for a large portion of your political career. He shares a large character flaw with many right wingers right now - just an overall lack of integrity. He advocates for a larger amount of campaign funds in politics because “[he] wants to win.” He blames past democratic administrations for foreign policy blunders in the Mid-East, when it is very much a fallacious standpoint to take to blame the actions of one political party for a complex topic (it’s probably 65%/35%, reps. and dems., respectively). He restricts abortion access (which I agree that abortion is morally wrong) but turns a blind eye to foreign and domestic human rights abuses (Uighur genocide, Rohingya cleansing, U.S. southern border situation). He falsely associates the expansion of the welfare state in the late 70s and early 80s with the socioeconomic disenfranchisement of black and brown communities (c.c. the Iran-Contra Affair, which introduced the drug trade into U.S. urban areas; it was transparently the responsibility of the Reagan administration and was swept under the rug by Bill Barr under Bush 41).

This kind of shock value gets them into the mainstream entertainment media and inside entertainment rags. Here is Nicki Minaj in all of her glory, looking more like one of the Avatar species as opposed to a human being. Why is she looking so blue in this picture with crazy cleavage and wild pink hair? This pose (and the entire picture, honestly) makes little to no sense, but it is wildly consistent with what Nicki Minaj does. Shock sells.",0
1452640013582225414,If the bitch get slick I’ll cut the chick Nicki Minaj is crazy LOL,"It's kind of difficult to extract the thought processes of someone who constantly wants attention. You know these people because you see them all the time when they attempt to glorify themselves in any way possible in order to get attention of any kind. For instance, in this crazy ensemble, we see Minaj dressed in quite the eclectic variety of wardrobe choices. First off, the ice cream necklace is an odd choice. We aren't crazy about the cone, we personally go for sugar cones. But aside from that, let's take a look at Minaj's insane hair creation, a creation that was done up to match the colors of the cone. Creative certainly. But she looks more like a piece of art to gawk at than a human being. And if we stare closer at Minaj's outfit, we see a crazy leather blouse sewn together in what seems like a baseball. No words.",0
1452640013582225414,If the bitch get slick I’ll cut the chick Nicki Minaj is crazy LOL,"If there is one thing for certain, we know that Nicki Minaj has no issues with her body. The rap diva is more than willing to flaunt her body with regularity. She isn't shy about doing it, either. There is no doubt that Nicki Minaj can look pretty damn hot in almost any outfit she wears; especially the tight ones. She enjoys flaunting it and she definitely has got it. Minaj's curves go north and south. Her booty is epic and combined with her ready-to-be-seen-at-any-moment-cleavage, Minaj is no stranger to being in the public eye. She is a regular violator on Instagram and knows how to play her looks to her advantage. Minaj does go to extremes to reveal nearly every part of her body imaginable and although she is no different from many other sexy female stars looking for attention, Minaj goes the extra mile with it.",0
1452640013582225414,If the bitch get slick I’ll cut the chick Nicki Minaj is crazy LOL,"We all know that Nicki Minaj is fierce lyricist who makes no qualms about unloading a stream of aggressive words in her music. She holds few punches and often can come across as crude and ""street."" It has to be difficult for a woman in the rap/hip-hop world. Standing strong on your two feet in the midst of a sea of men who often denigrate the female body and their standing in the world can be quite a feat. But the reality of Nicki Minaj is that she does have a chip on her shoulder that allows her to take whatever verbal punches are hurled at her and strike back twice as hard. Her unpredictability, however, sometimes gets the best of her. That's when she becomes crazy and lashes out. Minaj has gotten into confrontations with Mariah Carey and Miley Cyrus. With Cyrus, Minaj supposedly body- shamed the Disney princess for talking ""ish"" behind her back. Either way, Minaj has a short fuse and we wouldn't mess with her.",0
1452640013582225414,If the bitch get slick I’ll cut the chick Nicki Minaj is crazy LOL,"Who doesn't like a good show? Certainly, many of us enjoy watching a good songstress spin tunes in concert. But Nicki Minaj doesn't hold back when she is in concert. I know what some of the women out there may be thinking: ""she is exploiting her body. She isn't the kind of female role model we want for our children."" Yes. On both accounts. Nicki Minaj is certainly no role model. Her performances are filled with raunchy productions to sensationalize herself and her cosmetically rebuilt sexuality. Her outfits are extreme and, at times, can be just a tad revealing. Here, Nicki sings while giving herself up from behind as a male dancer takes a sexual posture. It is not exactly a Celine Dion concert.",0
1452640013582225414,If the bitch get slick I’ll cut the chick Nicki Minaj is crazy LOL,"There isn't exactly a lot to say about this. Clearly, Nicki Minaj has gone all Jackson Pollock on her face. Shock value is something that many artists go through these days. They do things to attract as much attention as possible. Here, this staged photo is more in the ""Noir"" direction as opposed to Minaj's more normal, ""Hey, look at my boobs!"" poses. Her platinum blonde look also isn't Minaj's natural color but she, along with most female artists, has a tremendous amount of latitude when it comes to changing hair color. However, not nearly as many artists will strip down to nearly nothing and have their face painted like the 1980s exploded all over their face. This look isn't the worst thing Minaj has ever done, but it certainly is on the extreme side.",0
1452640013582225414,If the bitch get slick I’ll cut the chick Nicki Minaj is crazy LOL,"Some women don't care what other people think. Others are hypersensitive and don't like when people try to paint them into a box. Nicki Minaj is a free spirit who has her own opinions on what sexy means and how to present her image. And there is little doubt that Minaj presents herself as a sexual object. She is relentless in the exploitation of her own body. This photo perfectly captures what Nicki Minaj does best- shock. She works hard to showcase her body in almost every way possible. And Nicki Minaj doesn't hold back. If it is raunchy and sexy, Minaj will not hesitate to be herself and her body on display. She will often times look like a sexy street walker and she doesn't give a flip about it. That is Nicki Minaj in a nutshell; love it or hate it, she is going to be just exactly what she has always been.",0

It's as if someone had 10 different outfits and had to sew them together. Then they threw a clear trash bag on around it and ""Ta-da!"" you have the bottom part of this ridiculous ensemble. Minaj goes WAY out of her way to look extreme when she performs in concert. Her top in this one is basically a bra and a Michael Jackson ""Beat It"" jacket. Then there is the hair. I don't even know how to describe this blonde wig. The fact of the matter is, Minaj doesn't really care what you think about how she looks. She is all about shock and the more she shocks you, the better she has done for herself. If she can get a few Twitter 'shout-outs' then she has done her job. I'm quite certain the cameras were flashing over this crazy get-up and she got her desired Internet chatter.",0

1452640013582225414,If the bitch get slick I’ll cut the chick Nicki Minaj is crazy LOL,"Nicki Minaj is not a person that would be described as docile or humble in any way. In fact, humility and low-key are two words that you will not find in her vernacular. Her ascent to the top of her business has been nothing short of meteoric. And these days, performers don't get extra points or noticed for being simply being great. No, they get credit for being ""people crazy."" When you are backstage at an awards show and body slam Miley Cyrus, we can definitely cite the crazy-card. This isn't the only time Minaj has gone off the rails. While she was working with Mariah Carey on American Idol the two divas went head-to-head in a verbal brawl that was more of a backstage fiasco than anything we got to see on camera. The point is, Minaj will do anything to make a scene and she rarely can control her temper.",0
1452640013582225414,If the bitch get slick I’ll cut the chick Nicki Minaj is crazy LOL,"Nicki Minaj's body transformation goes back a long way. She started her life as a slim young woman and quickly morphed into a tremendous hourglass package. Minaj didn't always have the body she has today. She went through a variety of changes along the way. One of the most striking changes she went through was the expansion of her backside. Nicki Minaj is known for having a bodacious booty. There have been many rumors that she got a butt implant but Minaj has confirmed nothing. Minaj has actually denied that she got a rear bumper boost but pictures tell a very different story. And for $11,000-$17,000 you can get one too! With the Internet abuzz about booties, it is not a surprise that celebs have gone out of their way to ""expand"" their rear horizons.",0
1452640013582225414,If the bitch get slick I’ll cut the chick Nicki Minaj is crazy LOL,"Uh...yeah. We all have seen the girl on Facebook that does provocative photos to get extra attention. They will pretend to be licking or sucking on something to get likes and comments. They will dress like whores so people will pay attention to them more. Hey, guess what? We are also describing Nicki Minaj! It's one thing to dress sexy, but Minaj has no boundaries for her desire to be noticed. In this picture, she thrusts her privates forward, showcases as much of her body as she can, and continues to double-down on her self-sexual exploitation. The lollipop licking is obviously a classic oral message that she is willingly sending out to the public. The gold chain and hood is a nice ""street"" touch to an otherwise crazy outfit.",0
1452640013582225414,If the bitch get slick I’ll cut the chick Nicki Minaj is crazy LOL,"If you pay for it, stick it out! We all know the plight of Nicki Minaj's well-documented booty implant. She wanted the goods in the backside and has pushed the envelope on both ends. To further collect on her plastic surgery investments, Minaj goes out of her way to show the world just how hot and sexy she can be. She is a twerking machine and doesn't care much who is watching her. Nearly every video of Nicki Minaj can capture at some point her bending over and shaking her well-invested booty like a kid shaking a wrapped Christmas present. To tell the truth, Nicki Minaj often resembles more of a stripper than a singing star. One of the issues is that Nicki Minaj knows she can't sing like other famous musical artists. She doesn't have the voice of Mariah Carey or Rihanna. To compensate, she bends over and shakes her rear wearing little to no clothing. And guess what? It seems to be working.",0
1452640013582225414,If the bitch get slick I’ll cut the chick Nicki Minaj is crazy LOL,"The convergence of fashion and crazy collide right at the doorstep of Nicki Minaj. The saddest part is that she is an attractive woman, although her assets have been greatly enhanced. There are no bounds to what Minaj will wear (or not wear) and when (or how). Much of the attention she grabs is based on her clothing choices (or lack thereof). Here's another Michael Jackson-wannabe outfit that was manipulated to meet with a Madonna ""Vogue"" kind of thing. We aren't sure what the heck Minaj put together with this little outfit. She shows a defiance for normalcy and goes out of her way to look like a freak. That is the craziest part of her. Now, if you have ever heard her speak, she doesn't exact light the world up with her intelligence. And her lyrics follow suit. But Nicki Minaj feels more like a sideshow act than a talented music artist. It's all part of the ""Nicki Minaj Experience"" though. She is who she is, love her or hate her she's going to be crazy-unpredictable.",0

Women will often go all naughty school girl or sexy nurse for the holiday to garner their desired attention from the opposite sex. Then there is Nicki Minaj.

Image & Fashion: Ripping a few pages out of the Lady Gaga handbook, Nicki Minaj is a showstopper at every public appearance. Bright and crazy outfits. Wild wigs in white, blonde, jet black, orange, pink and even rainbow. Freakish makeup. She wears all of the things that are guaranteed to get people talking the next day. Some people think she's tacky, while others feel that she is a fashion icon; either way, people talk about her wardrobe. She basically makes herself like a Barbie doll, mixing and matching clothes and styles in unpredictable combinations.

Notice the way she contorts her face. Observe when she flashes that signature creepy smile paired with those eerie, wide-open eyes. Notice how she will abruptly grunt, stutter, sing, or change the pace of her flow. She keeps you off guard. Unlike so many others who have no presence, Minaj's overall showmanship glues your eyes and ears to her. Just like her sense of fashion, she's unpredictable, so she retains your attention.

1452640013582225414,If the bitch get slick I’ll cut the chick Nicki Minaj is crazy LOL,"* She's a female rapper. This is probably the best thing going for her. There are very few current female rappers that come to mind. There were a lot of popular female rappers a decade ago, but not so much now. Someone like Lil' Mama got popular...a couple of years ago. I think rappers and male singers (e.g. Usher) tire of making songs with guys all the time, or girls who just sing the chorus.
 * Her rapping is easily digestible. Her lyrics are simple and Drake-esque. I'm not sure of the best way to describe it, maybe a generous use of similes (but what rapper doesn't do that?) but it's touched on here: How is Drake regarded by the hip hop community? [ https://www.quora.com/How-is-Drake-regarded-by-the-hip-hop-community ]
 * She's marketable/sexual. Basically, she can be a sex symbol if she wants (just do an image search of her). Lil' Mama rapped about lip gloss; Nicki Minaj raps about being a freak.
 * Her career has been fostered by Young Money/Lil Wayne. She joined a hot label at the right time, scoring collaborations with Lil Wayne, Drake, etc. Obviously they see it as a benefit to have a female in their group and have promoted her to help promote the label itself.",0

She is an amazing women who is not afraid to be her and thats what i love most about her she is confident and strong in many ways but not overly cocky. She has faced many things in life and has managed to overcome them all no matter what. She is not afraid to speak out and be herself. in my opinion she is very talented i have heard her in concert and she is amazing. because of  videos she has put out that may interest young teenagers like myself then they may listen to her in anything else she has to say.She does not go around acting like a major slut the whole time either like certain celebrities do if anybody has bothered to do any research she has done many speeches advising children to stay in school put in dedication and follow their dreams. She does not go around dissing everyone for no good reason and in my opinion her music is fantastic but not everyone may agree with that.,0

There's no denying that rap has always been a boys' club. Sure, there have been female rappers like Lil' Kim, Missy Elliot, Trina, etc. who did make a name for themselves, but for me it was Minaj who went a step further. She has firmly cemented herself in a high position and she's here to stay.",0
1452640013582225414,If the bitch get slick I’ll cut the chick Nicki Minaj is crazy LOL,"Her style, on record and off, is something I admire. She is one of the few (only?) female rappers to use alter-egos amazingly well. Roman Zolanski, Harajuku Barbie, Rosa, Nicki Teresa...the woman never runs out of ideas to surprise people. And she does it well. Her rapping style is extremely animated, and there have been times that I get distracted from the verse, but her grunts and noises just serve to accentuate her distinct charm. Regarding her fashion, again she has never failed to surprise me. She has gone from over-the-top to subtle in the recent times, and she has mentioned that this was temporary. Who knows what she will do next!",0
1452640013582225414,If the bitch get slick I’ll cut the chick Nicki Minaj is crazy LOL,"Another thing that I admire about Nicki is the way she talks about not labeling her. Her sexual orientation, her fashion style, her work...she's just Nicki. She doesn't want to fit into any predefined categories. Yet somehow she works in accordance with the untold rules of the industry. For example, she throws around the word ""bitches"" as much as the male rappers do. In ""Super Bass"", she objectifies men the same way 50 Cent would objectify women in his songs. And why is that appealing? It just is to me! Somehow I found that she treats men and women the same way.",0

It's okay to be any one of these types but it doesn't mean that you have the right to say that an artiste doesn't deserve the fame they acquired through their hard work just because you don't enjoy her music. Even if you don't like the music she makes, her fame speaks for her and a lot of people like her music. You are open to criticize but that doesn't change the fact that she's famous and her music is liked by many. I too would prefer a Kendrick Lamar over or J Cole over a Lil pump but that doesn't mean people don't enjoy him.

1452630538574082055,Kim Kardashian is that bitch,"It’s instantly iconic, the last line of Taylor Swift’s latest statement on her media tiff with Kanye West and Kim Kardashian: “I would very much like to be excluded from this narrative, one that I have never been asked to be a part of, since 2009.”",0
1452630538574082055,Kim Kardashian is that bitch,"Not long ago—pre-2009?—it might have seemed strange for most people outside an English seminar to casually throw around the word “narrative,” much less a Nashville pop star known for her love of cats and Christmas. But here we are in the age of the personal brand, where people like Swift, West, and Kim Kardashian have popularized the notion of popular culture—and maybe all of life—as a tangle of managed storylines that may or may not be rooted in fact. There are political and personal and social readings to be made of the ongoing spat between these three celebrities. Yet Swift has presented her current problem as purely meta: She’s mad, explicitly, at not being in control of this narrative.",0
1452630538574082055,Kim Kardashian is that bitch,"The loss of control indeed began in 2009 with rather on-the-nose symbolism when West grabbed the mic from Swift at the MTV VMAs to protest her winning an award. This last August, she’d given the appearance of brokering peace—and regaining subjectivity in this particular story—by presenting West with a lifetime achievement award at the 2015 VMAs. But the feud reignited with this year’s Kanye West song “Famous,” which features the lines, “For all my Southside niggas that know me best / I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex / Why? I made that bitch famous.” After furor at the song erupted, West tweeted that Swift had pre-approved the lyrics during an hourlong phone conversation with him, but Swift’s rep denied that was the case:",0
1452630538574082055,Kim Kardashian is that bitch,"Now, Kim Kardashian has thrown herself into what she has described as her full-time job: being her husband’s publicist. In GQ last month, she told a reporter that there was footage of Swift giving West permission for “Famous,” and last night’s Keeping Up With the Kardashians devoted itself to the controversy. When the episode finished, Kardashian’s Snapchat followers received an edited version of the much-hyped West/Swift exchange. In it, Swift says she’s very thankful he checked with her about the line “I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex,” and that it’s true West felt like he’d made her famous at the 2009 VMAs: “You honestly didn’t know who I was before that. It doesn't matter that I sold 7 million of that album before you did.” (A glorious diss and brag, no?) They appear to be discussing two possible versions of the lyrics, and Swift says, “Go with whatever line you think is better. It's obviously very tongue-in-cheek either way.”",0
1452630538574082055,Kim Kardashian is that bitch,"Swift’s first batch of complaints have been rendered dubious by this video: It certainly doesn’t sound like she and West were discussing whether she’d release the song on her Twitter account, nor do we hear her caution him about misogyny (though remember: Kardashian edited the conversation down to less than three minutes). And if she didn’t know he was going to say he made her famous, why did they talk about him believing he’d made her famous?",0
1452630538574082055,Kim Kardashian is that bitch,But the Snapchat video is most remarkable for seeming to give a peek into pop-music PR collusion. Here’s Swift on the phone with West:,0
1452630538574082055,Kim Kardashian is that bitch,"Why did the plan fall through? Swift has said she didn’t know the call was recorded, and so maybe she simply misremembered its details when her reps put out her initial anti-“Famous” statement. Or maybe she just decided the risks of spinning a story were outweighed by the benefits of objecting to the song. In any case, Kardashian release the footage has had its intended effect of making Swift seem like a liar in having called West a liar. The resulting social-media outpouring against Swift has been also amplified by recent criticism she’s received for seeming to leak information to the media about secretly writing a hit by her ex boyfriend Calvin Harris. A manipulator, this narrative goes, has been exposed.",0
1452630538574082055,Kim Kardashian is that bitch,"But Swift has now refined her version of events. “Where is the video of Kanye telling me he was going to call me ‘that bitch’ in his song?” she wrote on Instagram last night. “It doesn’t it exist because it never happened.” This is the new crux of the fight: “that bitch.” West has previously tweeted that he meant “bitch” as a term of endearment, which is how it’s sometimes used in hip-hop, though the song deploys it in lines that don’t praise Swift but rather strip her of everything but her potential as a sex object. For her part, Swift writes that, “You don't get to control someone's emotional response to being called 'that bitch' in front of the entire world.”",0
1452630538574082055,Kim Kardashian is that bitch,"Objecting to the word is a savvy move for her. It shifts the narrative away from one about her own honesty and toward a topic she feels more comfortable with: feminism. This was also the initial maneuver she used against the “Famous” lyrics, using her Grammys Album of the Year acceptance speech to “say to all the young women out there: There are going to be people along the way who will try to undercut your success or take credit for your accomplishments or your fame.” But it is also a tactic—or, hey, maybe even an honest response—that has backfired, as when she blasted Nicki Minaj for seeming to “pit women against each other” when Minaj made a race-based complaint about music awards.",0
1452630538574082055,Kim Kardashian is that bitch,"Gender and race may indeed be at the heart of why Swift didn’t let “Famous” pass by with the conspiratorial “Who cares?” she’d talked about on the phone. Her own self-presentation—her “red-lip classic thing that you like,” where (until recently) not even the belly-button is exposed—is so lower-c conservative, so unrelated to hip-hop in sound and look, that she’s accidentally attracted a faction of neo-Nazi fans in addition to middle-American parents who find her to offer pop music that’s safe for the whole family. Kim Kardashian, a white woman married to a black rapper, with an empire rooted in the sex appeal of her bared body, is exactly the kind of female icon Swift exists in contrast with. The gulf between them can be summed up in the fact that one finds the word “bitch” offensive and the other finds it innocuous. For Swift to allow herself to be called that term in a rap song really would be a betrayal of her own brand.",0
1452630538574082055,Kim Kardashian is that bitch,"Why are West and Kardashian continuing to antagonize her, though? They say it’s an issue of fairness. West went out of his way to give her the heads-up about the song, and for her to say he didn’t feeds into the narrative that has long enraged him: that he’s a cruel “jackass” (Barack Obama’s term) who acts out without reason. There’s always a reason for West’s provocations, and he typically says that reason is art. Within the context of his album The Life of Pablo, the Swift verse comes across like a jarring airing of lust and bravado as he looks back on a wild life from a place of newly married stability.",0
1452630538574082055,Kim Kardashian is that bitch,"Of course, the “art” label doesn’t remove the imperative to be a decent human being, and for all the negative publicity he receives, West loves to talk about being a positive person who improves the world. He seemed to think the Taylor Swift phone call was in that vein: “I don't want to do rap that makes people feel bad,” he told her.

1452630538574082055,Kim Kardashian is that bitch,"Kardashian has presented her role in this mess as a matter of loyalty: “I've had it with people blatantly treating my husband a certain a way and making him look a certain way,"" she said on Keeping Up With the Kardashians. But it’s impossible to avoid the fact that trying to embarrass Swift has drawn more eyes to Kardashian’s GQ story, her TV show, and her Snapchat account. “Taylor cannot understand why Kanye West, and now Kim Kardashian, will not just leave her alone,” Swift’s publicist said recently. The answer may lie in the fact that as irritating as this narrative of celebrity beef may be for Swift, in all measurable ways it has benefitted the person who's gained control of it: Kim Kardashian, who West once referred to as “my perfect bitch.”",0
1452630538574082055,Kim Kardashian is that bitch,"“Translation is like a woman. If it is beautiful, it is not faithful. If it is faithful, it is most certainly not beautiful.” People who love quoting Russian poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko usually begin with a statement to the effect of, “Yes, this is misogynistic, but we must put that aside to address its brilliance and accuracy.” One issue this quote highlights for sure is that not much has changed over time in terms of our general perception of women. Many of us (knowingly and otherwise) still embrace this idea that there are two types of women—the beautiful ones, who need not be faithful (which, in Yevtushenko’s quote is another word for “honest,” “conscientious” or “accurate,”) and those who, because of due diligence in other arenas, need not be (or cannot be) beautiful. The beautiful translation is pleasing to the eye and ear, but we respect the honorability of the faithful translation.",0

They make American entertainment look childish and superficial to the rest of the world. 9. They're a dime a dozen. 10. THEY ARE SUPERFICIAL.

They should remember that when the revolution came in France, the royals lost their heads for treating the people like dirt. KK is famous only for being famous, apparently for having sex in front of a video camera, and for being the spoiled rich daughter of a lawyer who defended OJ Simpson (though even OJ is entitled to a defense). KK's announced intention to become a lawyer is a complete joke: she couldn't even be bothered to get a college degree, and yet she thinks that she will pass the California bar exam which 60% of those who take it cannot pass.

I used to kind of despise the Kardashians like 99.9% of the people out there, before I looked into Kim K out of curiosity. I feel that she would actually be a pretty cool person to chill with IRL. Many who’ve met her for projects and such have exuded the same sentiment about her and said she’s really chill and nice.

From reading articles about her and watching interviews I’ve heard that for someone who is really famous and rich, she treats everyone as an equal and she is always nice to everyone. Usually celebrities of her calibre can be rather arrogant and egocentric but I’ve always heard that Kim K is a pleasant person to be around and she never really has a beef with anyone.

Even though I despise materialism and this celebrity worship that the kardashians thrive upon, I respect that Kim K has stayed clean from drugs and for the many young fans, I think that’s at least one good thing that might reflect on them.

Kim Kardashian has ingenious marketing mind, clearly knows how to market her beauty, has clearly figured out how to leverage social media, paparazzi phenomenon and her beauty to make money, as long as there are people to watch her every move, she will be popular.
2. Kim Kardashian has good business mind as well, has figured out a way to extrapolate her social media popularity with her beauty and established a nice business empire forming many strategic alliances including her marriage.
3. Kim and Kanye is a match made in heaven, Kanye with his music skill set is able to create some nice music, which with Kim’s popularity and marketing savviness they are able to market the songs and make good money, if you think about it, not very different from JayZ and Beyonce.
Bad things about Kim Kardashian",0
1452630538574082055,Kim Kardashian is that bitch,"1. She has accomplished all this at what cost? for some people it doesn’t matter what it takes to be successful, if you really look at the history she started with a sex tape, it is a little bit like Donald Trump’s strategy, she runs on the mantra that no press is bad press, but that is not working well for Donald Trump now, it is back firing in a major way, in his most important phase of life ever.
2. I have a daughter myself, I can quote Michelle Obama or Sheryl Sandberg or Marissa Mayer or Hillary Clinton as great role models for her, follow their lives, learn from their lives, emulate them or get inspired by them and by their accomplishments, but not Kim Kardashian, I cannot quote her as an inspiration or somebody that a girl should emulate or learn from.
3. She is setting a bad example, by doing anything that gets her press, especially all the nude pictures, nude modeling gigs, any thing and everything provocative.
4. She is not really adding any value to anybody with her business or products, just because she is beautiful and does provocative things with her beauty she is getting eyeballs and companies that are looking for such desperate eye balls are the ones that is making money for her.
5. Kanye is following the nude marketing style of Kim as well, looking at the latest song “Famous” where Kanye is sleeping with multiple naked people, so the bad influence is spreading.
6.

How many of these other men who have answered this question have slapped their buddies a high five for having sex with somebody? Have they ever criticized a male for being too outwardly sexual? People cannot stand to see a woman who is both successful and outwardly sexual. It's not just Kim. It's Amber Rose, Beyoncé, and back then, it was Madonna. This hatred of sexual women is nothing new.",0
1452630538574082055,Kim Kardashian is that bitch,"How is she the worst role model in human history? Men talk about sex in their music. They walk around half naked as well. They have “hoes”. I have never once in my goddamn little life heard anybody say, “Wow, Kanye’s a slut. He doesn't deserve to be where he is, because he can't keep it in his pants.”",0
1452630538574082055,Kim Kardashian is that bitch,"All these other answers completely center around the fact that she's “too sexual”. It's so pathetic that it's still an issue. Instead of hating this businesswoman who has capitalized from your own fucked up views on women, maybe you should be criticizing your own mentalities and the system that allows it. Kim’s success comes in part from these twisted views on sexuality, from this fetishization, from this demand that women be appealing but simultaneous shaming of them because we’re so immature about our own sexualities.",0
1452630538574082055,Kim Kardashian is that bitch,"There is literally no fucking reason to demonize anybody for being as sexual as they please, and she is definitely very intelligent. We don't demand that random male celebrities be perfect role models by the amount of fibers on their body. Kim is not a horrible role model for all girls because she shows some skin or has sex like any other average person.",0
1452630538574082055,Kim Kardashian is that bitch,People apparently just want to be pretentious and shit on somebody however it fits their sexist narrative.,0
1452630538574082055,Kim Kardashian is that bitch,There are so many answers in this question that distract themselves with the incorrect answer that:,0
1452630538574082055,Kim Kardashian is that bitch,“They’re just jealous”,0
1452630538574082055,Kim Kardashian is that bitch,"Heck, NO- they are not “just jealous”, you know why?",0
1452630538574082055,Kim Kardashian is that bitch,"It’s because there are THOUSANDS of beautiful, rich and famous women who promote meaningful values, and NONE OF THEM have even NEARLY the same scale of haters that Mrs. Barbie Doll does.",0
1452630538574082055,Kim Kardashian is that bitch,"This cancels out the “rich”, “pretty” and “famous” aspects and leaves you with the “meaningfulness” part.",0
1452630538574082055,Kim Kardashian is that bitch,"So using the same basic logic, you can conclude that the vast majority of people who hate Kim, disapprove of her, not because she’s rich, not because she’s popular or pretty, but because she’s shallow.",0
1452630538574082055,Kim Kardashian is that bitch,"Kim Kardashian represents everything meaningless about women. She got famous due to a set of highly unlikely circumstances, and her very presence on TV encourages women to follow her cult of buying her products with her name on it in hopes of becoming rich, pretty, famous and popular because of it, when in reality, Kim doesn’t want any of that, because it would give her competition in the marketplace. If she cared about people before they showed up on TV to criticize her, then she would follow a path that was meaningful, and- heck, she might even realise and admit it to herself that she had a responsibility to the people who followed her!",0
1452630538574082055,Kim Kardashian is that bitch,So her philosophy is basically lying to people and telling them what they want to hear- pretending to be their absolute babe UNTIL THEY CROSS HER- THEN THEY NEED TO BE ABSOLUTELY ANNIHALATED!,0
1452630538574082055,Kim Kardashian is that bitch,"Her philosophy is basically, “I want, gimme that”, “look pretty and care about nothing”. It’s not a good example for society.",0
1452630538574082055,Kim Kardashian is that bitch,"I don't hate her, I just don't find anything to admire. She is famous and wealthy without having produced anything of worth. She is a human marketing job. Ever seen those giant bags of cotton candy? Ever take one and just squoosh all the cotton candy down until it's nearly solid? It's about the size of a child's fist. Mostly what you're paying for is air. That's celebrities like the Kardashians: air, heat puffed sugar, no substance. It's like, when she leaves the earth, it will feel just like 10 or 15 great people just got born!",0
1452630538574082055,Kim Kardashian is that bitch,"I don’t hate, it’s just not my thing.",0
1452630538574082055,Kim Kardashian is that bitch,"What I can tell you though, is that my girlfriend watches the Kardashians and every time I pick up just a couple of seconds of that show, I feel a little bit dumber.",0
1452630538574082055,Kim Kardashian is that bitch,"It’s not Kim as a person that is the problem, it is that she represents pretty much everything that is wrong with “entertainment” these days…. appealing to the lowest common denominator.",0
1452630538574082055,Kim Kardashian is that bitch,"Shows like Jersey Shore are another good example of this, television these days is more about entertaining people with insipid bullshit and less about the stuff that matters and might actually teach you a thing or 2 that you might benefit from in real life.",0
1452630538574082055,Kim Kardashian is that bitch,"So in short, it is not Kim that is hated, it is the current media culture and her being the number one representative of that type of culture.",0
1452630538574082055,Kim Kardashian is that bitch,Not even sure why I'm even defending them and actually spending a moment of my life to do so..,0
1452630538574082055,Kim Kardashian is that bitch,But it's very idiotic when people hate on them. I get all the reasonings behind it and it's perfectly fine to dislike them. But hate? For something that they have no control of?,0
1452630538574082055,Kim Kardashian is that bitch,"Blame the media for making them famous. Blame society who idolizes them and blame yourselves for still talking about how much you hate them, giving them more interest and relevance that you so hate giving them!",0
1452630538574082055,Kim Kardashian is that bitch,They won't go away because society likes drama and I guess people like you haters just won't quit talking about someone/something you hate. If people stopped showing them interest then they won't be as relevant.,0
1452630538574082055,Kim Kardashian is that bitch,"Example, I see a video on YouTube about one of the sisters and it gets millions of views. And I see in the comment section, majority of comments are about her being talentless, why is she relevant, yada yada yada, basically spewing hate. If they hate her then why tf even click on a video of said sister and watch??!!! Or if didn't watchthen what? Just clicked on it to hate? For what purpose??",0
1452630538574082055,Kim Kardashian is that bitch,"Like I said, both fans and haters make them relevant. If all you haters truly want them to go away then quit talking about them, commenting, watching videos or anything at all to do with them. Because by voicing out your hateful opinion about the,m on YouTube, articles, etc etc just makes them more popular!!",0
1452630538574082055,Kim Kardashian is that bitch,"People hate Kim Kardashian because she has chosen to be, or just plain is, void of every virtuous and admiral thing we hold as important in our society.  The traits most people try very hard to display through out their lives: humbleness, honesty, integrity, intelligence, modesty, depth, skill, talent and meaningful self reflection seem to be nonexistent within Kim Kardashian.  While we have been taught that these traits are worth having at the expense of indulging our whims, Kim Kardashian has dismissed these traits for only her whims....which both fasciantes us, and disgusts us.  Yet, instead of falling from grace, she has made millions off of exactly that dismissal  of the virtues we have placed as essential.  Interestingly enough, it is our fascination and disgust that has made her rich, perpetuating our fascination and feeding our disgust even more.",0
1452630538574082055,Kim Kardashian is that bitch,"She's a genius. She is a businesswoman who clearly knows what the fuck she's doing. Why do you think she is where she is? Besides her marketing skills, there's a demand for her sexuality. I wonder who that demand predominantly comes from. It's always those same people who seem to demean women for owning their sexualities who will call her the scum of the earth for doing as she pleases with her own body. There are twisted, hungry attitudes about women and she simply capitalizes on that and owns herself. That's cool. Why does she need “talent”? That makes absolutely no sense. You don't disrespect someone because they're not talented enough for you. She's not on America’s Got Talent. It's her life.",1

1452610650002362371,demi lovato is that bitch 👏 https://t.co/BrYM0eq9Mm,"Most music documentaries megastars make about themselves follow a similar pattern: There are talking heads contextualizing the artist’s life and career; home videos proving the subject was destined for stardom from childhood; sporadic moments in the studio where the artist is dressed casually and focused; nerves before a show and the incomparable high after; and, if we’re lucky, tears about their grueling nonstop schedule. While we’re always promised unprecedented backstage access, the final product—from Ariana Grande, Beyoncé, Taylor Swift, and many others— often reinforces the arena-size distance between stars and their fans. Although they imply they’re letting us into their lives, their minds, and their creative processes, that’s rarely the case. Even “personal” documentaries function as a form of promotion guided by an undeniable and imperceptible plasticity.",0
1452610650002362371,demi lovato is that bitch 👏 https://t.co/BrYM0eq9Mm,"That’s the reason Demi Lovato’s four-part YouTube docuseries, Dancing with the Devil, which aired its final episode in April, feels so rare. Dancing with the Devil goes so far, in fact, that it seemingly eclipses its own purpose to reveal the events that led to their relapse and near-fatal drug overdose in 2018 and explore every aspect of their recovery. The docuseries was designed to humanize them to the fans who have followed them since they first stepped into the spotlight as a Disney child star and might find it harder to relate to them after their public relapse. In the lead-up to the release of their new album, which shares a title with the docuseries, Lovato also seemingly wanted to remind the music industry and the rest of the world that they’re committed to their career. Though the docuseries achieves these multitiered goals, it also offers the unprecedented access other documentaries promise and don’t deliver.",0
1452610650002362371,demi lovato is that bitch 👏 https://t.co/BrYM0eq9Mm,"Lovato does not hold back: “I actually don’t think people understand how bad it actually was,” they say during the second episode. “I had three strokes. I had a heart attack. I suffered brain damage from the strokes. I can’t drive anymore. And I have blind spots in my vision, so sometimes when I go to, like, pour a glass of water, I’ll totally miss the cup because I can’t see it anymore. I also had pneumonia—because I asphyxiated—and multiple organ failure.” Throughout the series, they chronicle even more traumatic moments, including their drug dealer raping them the night they overdosed and tearfully breaking off their engagement to actor Max Ehrich because they “didn’t actually know him” after dating for only a few months. Their openness and honesty is incredibly moving and it’s nearly impossible to get through the episodes without feeling moved by Lovato’s candid revelations.",0
1452610650002362371,demi lovato is that bitch 👏 https://t.co/BrYM0eq9Mm,"Between these moments of truth, there are also bits of traditional music documentary fare, including concert clips from Lovato’s 2018 Don’t Tell Me You Love Me world tour that were originally meant to be part of a more generic concert film. A number of people close to Lovato, including their parents, sisters, best friends, manager, security team, neurologist, and former assistant also offer insight into their journey. Everyone seems honest about how concerned they were for them and some even express anger about their relapse and near death—and Lovato encourages their honesty and vulnerability. For instance, they attended their choreographer and close friend Dani Vitale’s birthday party the night before their overdose, so many fans blamed Vitale for Lovato’s drug use and harassed her online, sending hateful messages, including death threats, on a daily basis. Although Lovato clarifies that Vitale never used drugs with them, they also express regret about never publicly clearing up the misconceptions. In the doc, they tell Vitale, “Like I said, clear your name. Don’t be afraid of saying anything. And I just want the truth to be told, because you deserve that.”",0
1452610650002362371,demi lovato is that bitch 👏 https://t.co/BrYM0eq9Mm,"This scene in particular shows how much control Lovato has over the docuseries: They’re deciding what’s included and what’s left on the cutting-room floor. In the first episode, Lovato says this to an off-camera producer: “I’ve had so much to say over the past few years…wanting to set the record straight. FYI: I’m just gonna say it all, and then if we don’t want to use any of it, we can take it out.” There are surely questions about what they chose not to share, given that they subsequently released a music video where they reenact their overdose and being found unconscious the next morning by their then-assistant. While divulging this level of detail might seem difficult for Lovato, it’s typical for music documentaries attempting to establish emotional resonance: We’ve seen Katy Perry bursting into tears when her now ex-husband, Russell Brand, texts her that he’s filing for divorce before she goes on stage; Lady Gaga receiving flowers from her ex-boyfriend, Taylor Kinney, before she performs at the Super Bowl; and Taylor Swift passionately arguing with her father about publicly taking a political stance.",0
1452610650002362371,demi lovato is that bitch 👏 https://t.co/BrYM0eq9Mm,"Lovato taps into this tradition when they reveal they’re opting for moderation instead of full sobriety, meaning they’ll continue drinking and smoking weed within the limits they’ve set for themselves. On “California Sober,” a song from their new album, they sing, “Used to live in fear of always slipping/ But living for perfection isn’t living.” It’s a harrowing confession, made even harder by the camera then turning to each of their loved ones as they respond to Lovato’s decision. Nearly every person says they support their choice, except for one of their mentors, Elton John, who says, “Moderation doesn’t work. Sorry! If you drink, you’re gonna drink more. If you, you know, take a pill you’re gonna take another one. You either do it or you don’t.” In that moment, a sense of dread settled in the pit of my stomach. Is the documentary itself somewhat of an omen?",0
1452610650002362371,demi lovato is that bitch 👏 https://t.co/BrYM0eq9Mm,"Dancing with the Devil is Lovato’s third documentary: In 2012, they produced Stay Strong, a MTV special that addressed the time they spent in rehab at age 18 to treat self-harm and an eating disorder. Simply Complicated (2017) revealed that they had been using cocaine while filming the first doc and explored their journey to semi-sobriety. Producers have said that Lovato’s engagement to Ehrich was meant to be the 2021 doc’s “happy ending,” but when that fell apart, it became clear that superstardom—and all that goes along with it—has likely contributed to their addictions and subsequent relapses. They note that their previous management team’s tight control over their schedule, their diet, and their branding as a sober mental-health advocate led to a need to “rebel” and fire their manager weeks before they overdosed. As their friend Sirah says, “If your life is set up to be focused on how you’re not well, then you’re not going to feel well.”",0
1452610650002362371,demi lovato is that bitch 👏 https://t.co/BrYM0eq9Mm,"But the correlations between the tight reins on their career and the impact on their health don’t stop there. Lovato also shares that being placed in beauty pageants damaged their self-esteem, being estranged from their alcoholic and drug addict father changed them, and being raped by an unnamed actor while they were on Disney only furthered their trauma. The list of their traumas is long and painful, but none of the loved ones in the docuseries suggest that they step away from the limelight or that perhaps the very camera shooting them might be part of the problem. Dancing with the Devil insists that Lovato is no Britney Spears; they have all the creative control and there’s no conservator dictating their every move. That’s all well and good, but it’s not where the story ends and it’s not enough to protect their well-being.",0
1452610650002362371,demi lovato is that bitch 👏 https://t.co/BrYM0eq9Mm,"When the #FreeBritney movement gained steam, fans demanded Spears’s freedom from the controversial conservatorship she’s been under for more than a decade. There was another element to the pleas as well: They believed that Spears should stop performing and making music if she no longer wants to, and instead spend time with her children and boyfriend, dancing, painting, and living a private life. It certainly seems to be what Spears wants and, at least for a little while, what other stars should get to have. We love to keep our pop stars under a tight lens: We want to consume them until there’s nothing left, and the machine is happy to keep churning them out. At the end of the docuseries, Lovato surrenders to a little dose of cliché: They chop off their lengthy brown tresses into a peroxide pixie cut to symbolize that they’re letting go of their past, their trauma, and the “old” person they used to be. While that’s a wonderful sentiment, it’s difficult to see it as anything more than a promotional rebrand, which we’ve seen a lot in the weeks since the docuseries’ release. Are they helping themselves by revealing their traumas or is this just a part of the machine rebranding them?",0
1452610650002362371,demi lovato is that bitch 👏 https://t.co/BrYM0eq9Mm,"In a recent interview with Variety, the docuseries’ editor Shannon Albrink said, “We didn’t want to say ‘everything’s fine’ and tie it up in a neat bow with a happy ending. Because that’s not the case. This isn’t a happy ending—we’re just showing the next chapter of [their] life.” In that sense, Dancing with the Devil does something few musicians have managed to pull off with their documentaries, making it reminiscent of an especially good one—1991’s Madonna: Truth or Dare. As Vulture puts it, “The entire movie seems designed—by Madonna herself—to force the audience to question who ‘Madonna’ is. The line between performance art and brand-building has never been so thin.” Perhaps that has to do with living in a very unique bubble. Perhaps for artists such as Madonna and Lovato, the line is blurred, and that’s where the contrivance lives. Or maybe being a megastar necessitates selling enough of your soul that you need Hollywood to keep you going.",0

It is similar to how transgender females claim they are discriminated against as women, which angers some feminists who feel that trangender females don’t have to live in fear of being raped and sexually harassed in the same way that natural females do. Personally, I think if it makes a person feel happy to identify a certain way, then I’m happy for them. But yes, it is odd when she is only 1% black. Apparently she also identifies as queer and gender neutral. It’s hard to know whether she just wants media attention or whether she really does see herself as a black, queer person.",0

When he was a teenager, he did three years in a reform school for stealing cars and armed robbery. In 1962, when Berry was 36 years old, he was arrested for violating the Mann Act, a law that prohibits taking a woman across state lines with ""immoral"" intentions. The girl was 14. He served 20 months of the three years he was originally sentenced to (via NPR), getting out on appeal after the judge made racist comments. According to the Riverfront Times, in December 1989, Berry was accused of videotaping women in the bathroom of one of his restaurants. The following June, his property was raided, with law enforcement finding weapons, pot, and the videotapes in question, placing him at the center of a class-action lawsuit.

Williamson says he was a huge fan of tickling and wrestling, along with everything else short of actual intercourse. Future wife Priscilla was 14 when she met 24-year-old Elvis, and just what went on behind closed doors is debated. What's not debated is that after Lisa Marie was born he lost interest in her, instead courting another 14-year-old named Reeca Smith. There was a bit of violence in Elvis, too. Years later, he was engaged to a 21-year-old who claimed he once pulled out a gun and put a bullet in the headboard of the bed she was sleeping in, saying it was ""an attention getter.""

The accusations are now so unrelenting that Lifetime was able to dedicate six whole hours for its harrowing documentary series Surviving R. Kelly. Perhaps one of the worst accusations is that Kelly kept black teenage girls in a demented sex cult, grooming them, abusing them, and having them cut off all contact with friends and family to become his personal slaves. A 2019 BBC documentary found evidence that Kelly kept 14-year-old girls as ""pets,"" a term that probably sums up all you need to know about his view of women. Still, we happily now live in a world where being rich and famous is no longer a guaranteed get-out-of-jail-free card. Following the broadcast of Surviving R.

He routinely did cocaine and then had sex with her in such a brutal way that Tina admitted it felt more like rape. He sometimes beat her. At various times he broke her nose, broke her jaw, gave her two black eyes, and left her with third-degree burns after hurling hot coffee in her face. At one moment in her autobiography I, Tina, the star writes with shocking frankness about tasting blood from a beating as she sang on stage. There are also rumors, many recounted in a Spin Magazine interview in which Ike tried to defend his behavior, that he threatened to kill Tina, shot bullets into her house after they split up, and once drove her to attempt suicide.

He hit people and was rude, and had mean things to say about everybody, and was ungrateful. But as time has gone on, he's grown up and matured, and is now a reasonably decent person.
3. Taylor Swift. I’m surprised I’m putting her on here too. She’s generally very generous and kind towards her fans and people in general, but she’s very defensive. When she was being blocked from performing her music at the AMAS, (VERY uncool,) She turned to her fans to drag Big Machines, which also isn’t cool. So she’s a little defensive, but she’s not a terrible person really. I mean, I love her and her music, but sometimes I totally see her hard side.

She withdrew the restraining order, after a divorce is the most dangerous time for an abused woman....this is practically an admission she never feared for her life. Him paying the 7mil could be seen as an admission of guilt, but in the context of his desire for privacy & wanting to end the media circus Heard created, added to the fact Heard refused to ever file a police report or even give a court ordered deposition, it would seem she was afraid of purjuring herself.",0

Did he hit her with a phone? Maybe, but because she threatened to drag him publicly through the press if he didn't give her what she wanted, then proceeded to do just that, & 2 da5s after the death of his Mother.....my opinion is that Heard is a narcissist with some co morbid disorder & Depp was an easy mark. She IS the one who was charged with DV. Depp has a substance abuse issue & possibly some mental disorder as well, probably codependency, 30 yrs of people describing him long before Heard rule out any disorder with lack of empathy as a symptom.",0

Unless having a bad day is seen as abuse nowadays… then you might as well jail everyone. In that video is a man who’s mother is dying and has likely received some bad news, probably regarding the Mandels court case. He is in his own kitchen, likely one of the few places he can be a human without someone shoving a camera in front of his face. He’s walking around, slamming a few doors, he throws a wine glass into the sink. It smashes. Probably angry, yes. Not an angel, but that isn’t abuse. His so-called supportive wife sits there sipping coffee, re-angling the camera to get a better shot whilst repeatedly prodding him with questions when his situation most likely hasn’t got anything to do with her. She makes it about herself. Even when he notices the camera he is calmer than I would have been. He places the wine glass down before grabbing her phone. An abusive person likely would have smashed that wine glass over her head in a fit of rage. A domestic violence victim probably wouldn’t even sit there filming him in the first place, it is EXTREMELY dangerous. He grabs the phone and from what I can see, chucks it in the bin.",0

Amber Heard used the social perception and prejudice of men as thugs, perpetrators and rapists to dominate Depp and play with him as she liked. She says this openly: ""Nobody will believe if I say you hit me, I am a slim woman, you are a man."" She often hit Depp hard. When Depp pushed her back one time, she said: ""You hit me."" Depp did the best a man can do. He left the apartment and took new hotel rooms. As a man, all he can do is flee. He asked her to lower her tone, but rational arguments fail in front of her narcissistic, obviously disturbed personality. This went so far that she hit Depp on the finger with a vodka bottle and had to sew it on again.",0

Of course if the woman chooses a big biker type with broad shoulders and muscles he might be stronger but you get what you choose to a degree. But it's not about physical superiority, it's about mental strength. Men don't know how to deal with a Virginia Wolf like Amber Heard. If they resist, the state power will classify this as abuse and they will be punished. They also think in ancient terms that it is dishonorable to defend oneself and it is a sin to use physical violence against women. In the social media, they are once rapists and at other times old-fashioned ""wags"" when they report beatings by women. Obviously social norms work here, where vodka bottles are not punished.",0

After 20 minutes or so I got tired of the annoying sound and the remote possibility of losing my apartment door, climbed out of my bed and went to investigate. It turned out the loud activity was being carried out by an unknown man. The man informed me that I had to immediately open the door because he wanted to talk to me. I informed him that I was not going to open the door. The man then said that he could also go outside and I could open a window instead. He said it was possible for us to chat like that.

He even nodded understandingly when I told him to shoot the criminals. I think I told him: “You have a gun. Shoot them!” I only said it because I was upset and angry. I did not mean it. But the policeman didn't even reprimand me for my murderous suggestion. He just nodded understandingly. What a nice man! I still have the copy of the police report in Catalan he wrote. It is now a souvenir. Anyway, I didn't like the name of the room where we had talked. I didn't want to be a victim again. The second reason was purely rational.

If a French woman had said the same - which Vanessa Paradis most certainly did not - the American press might have decided, that she probably did something to provoke him. Being French and such, you know ;-) ?
But I don’t think, those were the only reasons. 
That Ms Heard accused him at the height of the #metoo and similar movements being fashionabel helped her quite a lot, too.
And that JD’s former financial managers and lawyer also, at much the same time, did their best - or worst - to smear him, and portrait him as a bad and ridiculous person made it very easy for her to join the choir.",0

We are not talking about a whole group of women, as in for instance the Bill Crosby and Harvey Weinstein cases. 
On the contrary many women were on Johnny’s side.
No, it was one woman who, if they has checked the facts a bit, clearly had an ax to grind, because Johnny didn’t give in to her demands about condos for her and her friends, a car, and for him to pay all expenses on top of a monthly alimony.",0

However, there are a few different parts of Amber’s own account that are very atypical for someone who is truly being abused. When someone is a victim of abuse, they are often in survival mode; fight or flight mode. Or, as the more nuanced research indicates, fight, flight, freeze, flop, or friend (the 5 F’s [1]). The victim also usually goes to great lengths to avoid doing anything that might send their abuser into a fit of rage. Sadly, and as in my case as well, there is no way to avoid the abuser’s rage anywhere even close to 100% of the time.

Honestly, it’s more than highly unusual behavior. It’s completely inconsistent with how someone who is afraid for their own safety would behave.

2. Paulo Dybala : Credits to him that Juventus were strong in the league. UCL win gives him the first real chance at this.
3. Marcelo : He has been the best player for Real this season, along with Carvajal obviously. He has created 14 chances in the knockout stages of UCL and he is a wing back. He is the most creative player in UCL this season. His performance and passion in crucial matches is mind boggling. In my heart I want him to win this if Real lifts the two trophies its in race for.
4. N'Golo Kanté : Amazing season for him. Completely bossing the midfield in all the matches including crucial ones. lead PFA player of the season, he is a good contender.
5. Gianluigi Buffon : Just give him the trophy, nobody will be upset. Amazing season. Amazing efforts.

Take Lionel Messi, whom I’d consider the current front-runner (see below). His play during the second half of this year’s La Liga season with Barcelona has been nothing short of spectacular. His side won La Liga going away, and will likely also win the Copa del Rey next week. Barcelona won La Liga by 11 points, and Messi’s two goals today (within the space of about one minute) have him on top of the La Liga scoring table once again.

He will captain the Brazil team playing in the Copa America, and great play and a victory in that tournament will certainly boost his standing.

2. Van Dijk- As Liverpool is in the final and 1point behind city who is going to be a EPL winner. Liverpool had a great season. If they manage to win UCL against Spurs. Van Dijk may have a great chance to win it but Liverpool has been a great team. It’s not like Van Dijk is carrying them but for sure he has made their defense great along with Matip. But he deserves 2nd spot with such a great season.
3. Mbappe - Only player who is fighting Messi for golden boot with 30 goals (4 goals behind Messi). He had a great season in terms of goals scored and his contribution in goals for PSG. Still PSG had a bad season , with league won , lost UCL RO16, lost Domestic cup and can blame that to Mbappe for his foul and leading team down to 10-men. That’s the reason he can’t win Balan D’Or but will finish in top 3 or atleast top 5.

1452497730647957504,Piers Morgan is a sexless fuck,"Firstly, we must acknowledge that this is an unusual situation. Couples, only newly introduced are not going to sync sexually right away although these couples do seem to be primed for intimacy. Whether it’s the animalistic attraction of youth and a mixture of little clothing vs youth versus the commercial cash. These people are still human and share our own insecurities and fears of how we are perceived on camera, to a degree.While the cameras make it tough to become intimate, these guests have been selected for their exhibitionism and their lack of inhibitions. Secondly, while this is, as we are told, a sexy show and British TV has never been shy to push the boundaries of sex, the popularity of this show, screened close to the watershed at 9pm with major sponsor to please and Ofcom to fight still mean’s that careful editing has to take place. We do not know if the sex inferred is simulated, if its chopped and shaped to represent some form of sexual interpretation or if it actually is scripted. For instance, you never see a contestant stop and place a condom on before engaging nor does anyone on the close wired sound system seem to reach a climax. It is the Barbie doll version of sex, all simulated angles and no organs or fluids. Then there is the very real life issues that can come into play. It’s not easy to have sex on camera or in front of people no matter what these scripted individuals say. Last year saw the undignified spectacle of a John and Hannah crying over his apparent Erectile Dysfunction. In his defence, one could flip this on its head and ask, how can you feel comfortable with everyone watching?",0
1452497730647957504,Piers Morgan is a sexless fuck,"Porn stars select their career path as they possess (to quote Liam Neeson) a very special set of skills, everyday people they are not. Love Island contestants are selected for their looks, not for other skills. Thus, these men and women are experiencing some of the very real sexual issues as in society – Erectile Dysfunction, premature ejaculation, body morphism and size issues. These are real issues on display currently affecting millions of men and women in the UK and they are playing out in front of us every night.
• None The times periods these sexual activities complete in – usually under 4 mins from beginning to end.
• None The obsession with muscles, grooming and size as discussed by both the women and men.
• None In a recent episode, two of the women were discussing how a particular contestant was too good to be true. Her friend replied back ‘maybe he has a small dick’ as they collapsed in laughter. It would be amazing to see 2 male contestants discussing their female partner’s vagina shape with the same mirth and candour.",0
1452497730647957504,Piers Morgan is a sexless fuck,"Let’s first address the ED issue. This is a problem affecting up to 50% of men at some point in their life and while curable is still an extremely taboo topic. Premature ejaculation concerns a vast majority of men and their partner, causing relationship issues, a lack of confidence and unsatisfied love lives. And 42% of men have recorded a desire to have a larger penis. No one talks about these issues. These numbers indicate that men are underserved medically and educationally in terms of their sexual organs and will not seek treatment. A recent statistic indicated that 72% of men suffering from some form of Erectile Dysfunction in London, do not seek any treatment at all. In a way, Love Island has an unenviable position to bring these issues to light rather than sending dangerous signals about men’s and women’s roles in these manufactured sexual relationships.",0
1452497730647957504,Piers Morgan is a sexless fuck,"The time length of these sexual activities, rarely more than 4 mins, is much shorter than widely accepted satisfying norms for couples. The other element that strikes a viewer as odd is that there seems to be no foreplay other than kissing in action. While graphic displays are not to be expected, the speed to which apparent penetration takes place is alarming for anyone which a more experienced view of sexual activity. Foreplay has been shown to be one of the main activities leading to pleasure and orgasm for women. Orgasm through penetration is a much rarer situation. Secondly, the definition of sex seems to be defined by the male time in action. There is no reference to the female partner reaching a climax. There is no discussion post-coital of technique or desires. There is little evidence of male climaxing either but how the show defines ‘sex’ seems to be determined by the male activity only. The way the act is referred to in the abstract as ‘the deed’ clearly provides a strange whitewashing of sexual activity reducing it to the male penetration action, with little satisfaction for the female participant.If we are to take Love Island as a microcosm of society’s popular vision of who we are (I would not advise this but logic would indicate as we usually watch what we relate to), indicate that all these factors play a role in defining us. To recap, it shows we are all grammatically vapid, physically obsessed with body shape and happy to bare skin for cash. We talk about sex endlessly and have no problem making fun of men’s body shapes yet our sex lives are premature, dysfunctional, defined by male participation only and apparently very, very quiet.It is a strange position to be in when our sex lives are represented as so sexless.",0

One MRA she interviewed made a point. Most MRAs started as feminists. They believe in equality and women’s rights. When they suggest including some focus on men in things like rape culture and domestic abuse, they are told to do their own rally if they want to bring awareness to those issues. And when they do, they get attacked for making light of women’s issues. When Ms. Jaye showed her editor an early cut of her documentary, she was asked why she showed angry and belligerent feminists but not MRAs with the same behavior. And the simple answer is because there isn’t any footage of it. There are significantly more instances of feminists attacking others than there are of MRAs attacking people. The Red Pill had threats and protests of theaters. Ms. Jaye had made a dozen documentaries supporting feminism, and she never had a problem getting funding or support spreading those documentary. But when she made a documentary exposing the truth of the Men’s Rights Movement that showed how they were persecuted and had real issues that needed to be discussed, no one would return her calls. News agencies attacked her on air and edited the interviews to put her in a bad light. One Australian news program claimed she had given them a bad link to prevent them from viewing her documentary. She checked, and there were four working links provided to them.",0

Across the US, there are over two thousand women’s abuse shelters. Across all of North America, there are only three or four men’s abuse shelters. There might not even be one hundred men’s shelters in the world. An informal test of the National Abuse Hotline found that only 17% of men were happy with the assistance they received. The ones that couldn’t be helped were lucky if the reply was an apologetic “there’s nothing we can do.” More likely, they were told they must have done something to deserve to get hit. Or they were accused of being the abuser. This in spite of the fact that a 2014 CDC study of intimate partner violence found that 50% of cases involved both the man and the woman abusive towards each other, 26% of cases where the men only were abusive, and 24% of cases where the women only were abusive. Experts believe there are more abused men than women due to societal stigma and lack of resources to escape. It’s hard enough when you have to spend a few hours to get to a safe shelter, but it’s even harder when you have to get across a few states. And the policy for many co-ed shelters when a woman expresses fear due to having a man nearby is to eject the man. While some groups are working to change it, many government assistance programs for abuse and rape specifically have guidelines that state they are only for women. Imagine if unemployment was worded as a program to assist men in providing for themselves and their families. Which is also part of the problem with rape statistics. For many studies, the definition of rape is the unwanted penetration of an orifice. That means that a woman forcing herself on a man isn’t rape because he wasn’t penetrated.",0

The former is celebrated across social media and the news. But most people don’t even realize the latter exists. And the idea is considered laughable because International Women’s Day is also used to celebrate women’s accomplishments along with bring awareness to issues. So when people talk about International Men’s Day, they focus on the celebrating achievements aspect instead of the awareness of issues. Which is what happened with the University of York a few yeas back. Letters were written to cancel a summit for International Men’s Day because it made light of women’s issues. But no similar protest for their International Women’s Day event. There’s always the lament that men need to change their attitudes and social skills. If only there was a day where that kind of thing could be discussed for actual actions instead of demonizing. Britain had a similar problem. An official made a motion to have a similar month focusing on men’s rights concerns just as there’s a month dedicated for lawmakers to discuss women’s rights concerns. A feminist official laughed at him. Claimed that the rest of the year is all ready dedicated to that. But when anyone tries to do that, it gets yelled down for sexism and ignoring women as the true victims.",0

4. Feminism is based on total bullshit like wage gap and rape culture. They do not understand that there is no such thing as rape culture and you get paid because you don't work as hard as we men do.
5. Feminism thinks there are 2+ genders when there are only 2. You either have a penis or a vagina. And NO! You cannot identify as a chicken, hamster, carrot or a chair.
6. Feminists hate men (trolling Men's Day and Father's Day) but when we men do it, they call it misogyny.

She's playing opposite Annette Benning, Jude Law, Samuel L Jackson, Josh Brolin, Chris Hemsworth, etc. It's not like she's not in an environment that is conducive to success (although the direction in the Captain Marvel is highly questionable most of the time). The best analogy I can think of is that she is like in a really great rock band surrounded by super stars, and she’s off. And the audience can tell that something is off. And they’re pretty damn sure it’s her. Because when she’s not on stage or not playing in a song, the music is magically better, more coordinated, more dense, more fully realized, etc. Contrast this with any number of awesome action actresses. Robbie, Theron, Chastain, etc. These women ooze intensity when they need to, and do it in interesting and relevant ways. Larson is a really particularly boring flavor of vanilla. There are actors who do interesting flavors of vanilla. Larson has not been one of them.",0

I'm going to speak from personal experience here, so I can't say for certain if this is why you feel this way. But I know that often when I feel insecure about myself in any way, it can make me feel insecure about my appearance as well. For example, I had never really thought of myself as overweight before, and hadn't worried much about how I looked. Then, one year back in school, my family had to be apart from one another due to work and school, and it was a change I'm not certain I was ready for. After it occurred, I started to feel insecure about things. Then, when this insecurity began, my confidence went down, and then my grades began to drop as well. When my grades dropped, my confidence dropped even further. I didn't even feel like myself, and began feeling very self conscious about my intelligence, my voice, and also my looks. I'm not sure why it affected how I thought I looked, but it did. When I managed to get my grades back up, and I began to get used to the new normal, my confidence began to rise some more, and I became less worried about my appearance. Now, for example, I feel good about myself again for the most part, and I'm not very unhappy about my appearance.",0

I can say what helps me is finding something I really love to do, or really want to learn to do, and focusing on it. When I can get my mind off of myself, it helps me not feel so self-conscious. If you have a passion, like maybe learning about certain things you like, or finding activities you enjoy, etc., then focusing a lot of attention on those things might help you feel better. Getting really good at something and boosting your confidence is a really great thing to do. And I don't mean arrogance when I say confidence, either, as they are different things. You shouldn't feel bad about feeling like you can do something or that you know something when you feel confident. I see arrogance as involving beating others down (which brings you down), and confidence as involving seeing everyone as equals, building others up by finding security in who you are. It's good to be confident, and if you are someone who feels like knowing you are good at something is arrogance, please don't let yourself be beaten down by this, and remember that there really is a difference (sorry if this is completely unrelated to you, I'm not meaning to lecture you.

If you’re pretty, chances are people are looking. But not just looking, usually staring, very deeply for long long periods of time.

(Statistically speaking it is INSANELY rare to have a perfect nose without cosmetic surgery). Try taking pictures of you a bit further away, with you doing something like on a jetski for example.

Same Sex Social backhanding, if women like one thing, it’s to be seen as attractive / sexy / in demand or wanted by the opposite sex. Whether they admit it or not, they’ll miss it if it’s gone believe me. Now if a woman who is less attractive than a socially deemed ‘pretty’ woman hangs around with her, to be frank she’ll make her look like a potato. She’ll be over looked for the pretty one and thus in less social demand. It’s just marketing, if there’s a better product right next to you, why go for that one? I don’t mean to objectify women there, but looks is the first thing men go for as unfortunate as that may sound. You have to be attracted to your partner physically on some level. Females will tend to stick to groups of girls who are around their own level of attractiveness or worse than them especially when they’re in their teens or early 20’s when their market value is reaching its peak.

The only use she has for rich powerful men is abuse & to use them for her own agenda.","The first thing that is released is a pulse of testosterone. The presence of this elevated level of hormone triggers the release of a few other chemicals in the brain. The first of which is an increase in dopamine. Dopamine plays a lot of roles in the brain. While testosterone may start the whole process, it is dopamine that travels to all the other parts of your brain and starts all the different mechanisms going that your brain connects to getting you laid.",0

If you have ever seen a movie (Pulp Fiction for example) where someone gets a shot of adrenaline, you know that it has a very stimulating effect on a person. This is exactly what norepinephrine is doing to your brain and body. It is like you drank a lot of caffeine or amphetamines. The goal is to provide you with the motivation, alertness, and energy to make something happen. But the mechanism norepinephrine triggers is the same mechanism that gets triggered when you are about to get into a fight this is your sympathetic nervous system. When it is triggered your blood pressure goes up, your non-essential functions shut down. You feel really pumped.",0

1452466335749967874,"It's just feminism, gay stuff, adhd tips, our perception of the universe isn't real, and now Beyonce is the Devil.","I should probably add this disclaimer: I am a fan of Beyonce, however I am not a super fan. I will not threaten you if you disagree with me. However, like any other discussion, I would expect more than, “she’s horrible” to be a point of entry to the conversation. I’m grown, and have too many things to do. But I thought I’d take a crack at this for fun. Anywho.",0
1452466335749967874,"It's just feminism, gay stuff, adhd tips, our perception of the universe isn't real, and now Beyonce is the Devil.","* Pre-existing Legacy: For many Beyonce’s star power has been a long one in the making. Anyone that listened to R&B girl groups in the late 90’s early 00’s probably was also a fan of Destiny’s Child. They had a ton of hits and tons of fans throughout their various band member shuffles. At the forefront, Beyonce was the main staple. Her first independent album helped cement her as a star. Her following albums helped her soar.
 * Jay Z: This one goes without saying. He’s hip hop royalty. Amidst a number of legends that never lived long enough to continue their legacy, Jay Z is a living monument for many. Couple that with the mega star that is Beyonce, add a lot of money, creative projects, business savvy, and mystery (more on that in a sec) and you’ve got yourself a couple of A-Listers.
Dang. They even stand like royalty.",0
1452466335749967874,"It's just feminism, gay stuff, adhd tips, our perception of the universe isn't real, and now Beyonce is the Devil.","* Private Lifestyle: The Carters are extremely private people. In an age where everything and everyone is accessible, it’s a rare occurrence to find a celebrity that stays relevant and still manages to keep their personal lives private. Beyonce rarely gives interviews and will rarely show up on magazine covers. What makes the Carters more appealing is the mystery that shrouds them when something juicy and scandalous sneaks through the cracks. They never utter a word about any drama. We’ll never know who bit Beyonce in the face, nor will we ever find out why Solange molly-wopped Jay Z in an elevator. Never. If you tell someone to not think of purple ducks, then that’s exactly what they will think of. The Carters are the purple ducks. People eat up the mystery and love to make their own theories.
 * Cultural Connection: this is probably the point that causes the most disagreement, and most likely will be disputed as having little clout. I can’t make anyone get on board, but this is what I know to be true. Black women relate to her. Not all, but many. She is plugged in, there’s no other way to explain it. She gets the struggles at both the macro and the micro levels of black existence for many people. She also takes that experience, turns it on its head and makes amazing visuals to accompany her work. It’s multi layered and symbolic. Black women are a market and those coins count.
 * Work Ethic: She thinks outside the box for her videos and performances. She works hard for the money. Cochella, Super Bowl, world tours, visual albums, everything is planned and executed down to the most minute detail. She must have a hell of a creative team because she delivers for her fans, every time. Say what you want about her, but that lady is a force. Singing at full range, in stadiums, in heels, while doing intricate choreography can’t be easy. I’ve seen footage of her getting her hair caught in a fan, falling down a set of prop stairs and getting her ass inappropriately slapped. She never misses a beat.
 * Professional Relationships: I don’t have a complete leg to stand on here, so I’m gonna go with relative common-sense guessing. The entertainment business is rough. If the big wigs don’t like you, you don’t work. From what I’ve seen, the Carters appear to be charming and likable to their peers. Other celebrities treat them like royalty because see previous points. They like her music because maybe they grew up to Destiny’s Child. Maybe they secretly want to attend an exclusive Carter’s’ party. Maybe they want her for a project. Maybe they just like her. “Shrugs”. What I do know is that the Carters have friends and relationships in high places. That counts for something. She’s also chosen to do projects outside of her range of singing. Films, philanthropic endeavors, and a clothing line have all made appearances in her professional career.
 * Fans: One word: Beyhive. Enough said. Her fanbase is out of this world and extremely loyal. I’m too old, and I don’t know that lady enough to love her unconditionally. However, her true fans do. She touches people and the range of her fans exist outside of just black women. She sells out her shows. She tops charts and makes sure to keep everything she does fresh. She also incorporates enough nostalgia and throwback choreography to keep the fans included. There may even be a peak into her personal life via a performance or video. You may not see her for months on end, but just know, if she whispers the vaguest signal of an appearance, her fans know. And they are willing to pay.
I purposely didn’t mention talent as a marker because it goes without saying that she is talented. In my opinion, entertainment is often consumed based on extreme biases, personal connection, and every once in a while persuasion (i.e marketing or recommendations). I’m of the latter and didn’t become a huge fan until I was an adult and listened to her title album. It spoke to me ya know?",0

I also don’t think that her rise to celebrity is unique to her line of work. There are the Lady Gagas, Taylor Swifts and Chers of the world. Scratch that. There’s only one Cher. Some people just have “it” and I believe she’s one of them. Her career is far from an accident however, and I think being a thick-skinned player has also helped her remain on top.

She told me she was very appreciative that as opposed to hounding her for a picture I simply wanted to converse with her.

Two experiences made me feel that, to the contrary, that Beyoncé does not deserve any such talent bashing. The first was watching a Sesame Street video of Destiny's Child singing for Elmo (of all things!!!). I’m watching this trio do their thing, and although the other two women singing were very talented it was IMPOSSIBLE not to be staring at Beyoncé. Was she ravishingly beautiful? Well, ok. But trust me, just being physically gorgeous can get boring pretty quickly. What I saw in her performance in this completely inconsequential video (as it concerned her career) was a complete commitmemt to what she was doing, to her uncanny ability to make love to her audience with her entire being, her vocal smoothness and her complete embodiment of grace.

Many of her different looks in the music videos are a depiction of African gods and goddesses. To the American culture it is viewed as demonic because some of her looks has resemblance to the symbols of the devil. Especially one look in movie where her hair was braided in the shape of goat horns. That was actually just her rendition of an African deity. To answer the question is her album demonic or not is simply a personal opinion. Many Christians do not agree with any type of Orsha or spirit worshiping therefore her album may not be for them. On the other hand her album has exposed African culture to the western world giving many African Americans a new sense of identity and culture to be proud of.,0

And it’s pretty unusual for a black person to say they are Cajun. At least in Louisiana the black people with some French and mixed race ancestry usually say they are Creole, not Cajun. She comes from a family that has a French last name, Jacquet. I knew that family (probably distant relatives) from New Iberia/Cade when I taught school one year in New Iberia. The terms Cajun and Creole can be very fluid and confusing. BTW the jazz saxophonist Illinois Jacquet is from the same family.

Generally both good and bad spirits are always ready to possess human beings. That is their nature. They were/are created by God with that nature. Bad spirits reach and possess human beings very quickly than good spirits.,0
1452466335749967874,"It's just feminism, gay stuff, adhd tips, our perception of the universe isn't real, and now Beyonce is the Devil.",Human beings are ruled by spirits but humans must learn to control and rule the spirits. Spirits possess people according to the mental state of the human beings and keep them in the same state until they are rejected and replaced by another. This is an all time phenomena occurring in all humans. Human beings are always under the influence of spirits. Certain situations and circumstances cause the possession of certain type of spirits. Often thinking and talking about bad subjects or bad imaginations even for fun can take serious turns on one who think and talk. Often thinking and talking about good subjects with good imaginations can create positive effects in your life. Your favorable thoughts and beliefs can bring favorable spirits by your side. The more you think the more would be the possession of that spirit. All spirits (good and bad) have the dominating nature. They can take you to the extent of sacrifice or suicide.,0
1452466335749967874,"It's just feminism, gay stuff, adhd tips, our perception of the universe isn't real, and now Beyonce is the Devil.","God never bothers whether people believe in him or not. God’s intervention in human affairs is very rare. God doesn't watch each and every human being at the same time and cannot live with each and everyone to guide them. These works are done by the spirits. God had created different kinds of spirits for various purposes. He had made the spirits to watch, guide and determine the destiny of the human beings from their daily activities, talks and thoughts too. Your past determines your present and your present determines your future. God has given freewill to all creatures including human beings. According to this, all human beings have all right to live a life as they wish. But if it happens to be bad and hurts someone, they have to face the consequences. These consequences are created by spirits. It's a natural system. After death no one lives in any form. Heaven and hell are only for spirits, not for human beings. God is a mystery even to the spirits. Spirits are not eternal beings but their lifetime is long. Spirits are separate elements. A human being during his/her lifetime is living with many spirits which have joined one by one since birth. They are knowledge, skills, feelings, emotions, interests and everything. Further there will be always some spirits with you on behalf of your parents, friends and relatives. Only these spirits make you remember them in a certain situations. All of these spirits are your consciousnesses and memories. Even thoughts are not your own. For example, when you want to take a decision on a subject, one after another the spirits think and you just listen, choose or reject the ideas which they transmit to your mind through your brain in the form of thoughts. A mind is a combination/formation of many spirits which have joined one by one since birth. A mind is just like a computer's mind. After the destruction of a computer completely you will not get its mind. The same is the case with the human beings. A brain is a device used by the spirits to control the body. A human being doesn't have a spiritual body. Soul is nothing but an energy needed for the functionality of a body. It is not a spirit or anything else. A body's functionality is based on the auto mechanism. After death all spirits which accompanied a person quit and go to different places searching new bodies. No one lives after death in any form. All human beings are just robots made of flesh and bones and toys of the spirits for their games.",0

When they talk to you, do not reply or do so with dismissal. Look and talk over them as if they were an ant in your way. Whenever they try to get a rise out of you, do what you’d do if a baby tugged on your hair. Smile playfully, and walk away. Few people can stand the insult of not being recognized.
2. Never respond emotionally. In any conflict, the first person to respond with emotion is the lower status victim. Treat every abuse as a business transaction. Speak calmly, do not stutter, do not use too many words with them. Let them be emotional and look like fools.
3. When they attack in a serious manner, respond casually. When they attack you in a casual manner, respond seriously. This way you assume your frame on the situation instead of letting them push your into their frame.

He hadn't hit puberty then and had a lower pitch in his voice. Since his songs were cute and talked mostly about sweet young love, his fan base increased among young teen girls and his so called girly voice made him lose male fan following.

1452465714594566146,those justin bieber memes in like 2011 were justified justin bieber is an awful person,"I'm going to take this question seriously and attach it to a broader cultural question using other cultural phenomena as well. I don't know whether the intent of the question merits this energy, but I think it probably does. 
 
I'm going to assume that this question is not about the version of Justin Beiber that is falling apart in front of our media gaze, in the same way that other young stars have, like Lindsay Lohan and Britney Spears. Justin is a train-wreck right now, if you read the media reports. One anonymous answer here references this. That's not why males hate Justin Bieber. Or, rather, that is not the Justin Bieber males hate.
 
Assuming your premise is correct--it must be--then I would say that some young males ""hate"" Justin Bieber in the same way that they hated the vogue for vampire movies and TV shows starring dangerously attractive but somewhat feminized male characters, or the way, in my generation, that ""Disco Sucks"" became an anthem for so many young males.
 
Sexuality is very complicated for human beings--frankly, it is the Achilles heel of the species in certain ways, since it ties us to our biological natures even as it also links to the most angelic elements of our being, which have to do with our capacity for self-reflection and, most of all, our ability to love others. 
 
Fucking is an animal thing, and the incidence of sexual violence, obsession with pornography, casual affairs and infidelities, committed by men is so great that only a fool would say that there is not some program in the male body that is about these things--mainly the evolutionary drive to maximize outcomes for procreation. 
 
All of this is tempered by civilization, sublimation, self-reflection, other biological values if one accepts that altruism may also be hardwired, the function of language, etc. 
 
The kind of males who hate the young Justin Bieber, who is essentially pre-sexual, or ur-sexual, at the threshold of sexuality but not yet sullied by the physical dimension of it, are also in a period of maximum conflict regarding two male imperatives: to be a biological being and enter one's male, adult body, and to be a good man, and learn to love and care for others. 
 
Hating versions of maleness that seem to have their cake and eat it--to be freed of the actual physical, biological being of maleness, while also getting the love and sexual adoration of females--in the ways that the young Justin did, and the various vampire heart-throbs before--is a natural response to a strange input into a very difficult equation. 
 
Disco was the same way. Disco promised that you could dance like a woman, with that easy being inside the rhythm of one's body, sinuous and cool, and be loved like a man. It was, of course, a gay music--before AIDs essentially destroyed an emerging gay culture. (You have to have lived in NYC in the 1980s to know what this means.)
 
Most white boys of my era were listening to Led Zeppelin and Sid Vicious at the time, and the idea that there was an alternative to that sort of expression of male power and aggression that might be more attractive--that was hateful. ""Disco sucks!"" Male aggression more or less killed it, though it went underground and came back up through R & B in certain ways.
 
Males don't hate Justin Bieber (at least, not the early, sweet, cute Justin Bieber.) No. They are terrified of him. He represents an equation for sexuality and development that is literally unavailable, and the fact that girls like him so much--much more, so much more, than the emerging, confusing, male self of the adolescent or young adult typical male--make him a terrible threat, and something, for that reason, to be hated.
 
Not all males are like this. And most females manage to figure out that Justin Beiber, like the vampire boys, are just chimeras, enchanting but unreal. In the end, love comes from how we are different, not how we are the same.
 
Edit: Since this answer has generated some notice, I wanted to add a couple of clarifying points. The first is that I would emphasize the phrase ""many males"" in the question, and make clear that while I make a fairly sweeping generalization, many young men are exceptions to this rule, and find androgyny attractive, or at least unthreatening. 
 
The second is that, as some commentors point out, the more recent iteration of Bieber has behaved quite badly in ways that are easy to dislike--though one might also say that these behaviors might be judged less harshly if he had been a bad boy from the start. I don't think the question had the current version of Bieber in mind, or at least my answer is about the first Bieber, not the new one.
 
Finally, in fairness, I should also have observed more clearly that one component of the hatred is a sense, whether conscious or unconscious, that a cultural figure like Bieber, and the vampire boys before him, is manufactured by the culture industry and wholly inauthentic in that way. It is not just the sweetness and prettiness that seem loathesome, but also that these are a lie.",0

I listen to Holly, and was kind of surprised by how much I liked it. His vocals were good, the lyrics were sweet. And the music video? It had a really good message. And then I listen to Lonely. That song brought me to tears, because it’s so relatable, and so beautiful.",0

All of a sudden I decided that I didn’t hate Justin Bieber anymore he was a decent singer, with a beautiful story, who is sorry for the things he’s done in his past. I for gave Camila Cabello for her mistakes, and now I love her. Could I not do the same for Justin Bieber? What made him different? Why was I holding this grudge that he was such a terrible person, when he apologized, just like some of the celebrities I still loved?",0
1452465714594566146,those justin bieber memes in like 2011 were justified justin bieber is an awful person,"So I gave up on hating Justin. He’s not exactly on my stand list, and I don’t love him. But I certainly don’t hate him anymore. Let me tell you why I did hate him, and maybe it’ll answer your question.",0
1452465714594566146,those justin bieber memes in like 2011 were justified justin bieber is an awful person,"My friends hated him. When I was in kindergarten, my friends constantly talked about how much they didn’t like Justin Bieber. I had no reasons to hate him, but I was a little kindergartners, who followed with my friends did. So, I didn’t like Justin Bieber either. And that’s final.

1452465714594566146,those justin bieber memes in like 2011 were justified justin bieber is an awful person,"Once people start hating a person, they usually don’t try to stop hating them. Justin himself says, “They criticize the things I did, as an idiot kid.“ This was the first crack in my hatred. It’s so sad, to think that people change, and people around them don’t care to notice. They’re stuck in this mindset that that person is a terrible person. It’s not fair.",0

Because I’ve had everything, but no one’s listening, and that’s just f***ing lonely. I’m so lonely.” That is really pathetic, but also really really heartbreaking.

1452465714594566146,those justin bieber memes in like 2011 were justified justin bieber is an awful person,"That song, too, has a good point, and is also sad. He says, “Made some bad moves, trying to act cool, upset by the jealousy.” He accepts the fact that he made mistakes. He continues with, “ I have to take responsibility for everything I’ve done, holding it against me like you’re the holy one.“ He called us out here. It’s not like I’m perfect. Why am I holding all of his flaws against him, when I have just as many? Because he’s famous?",0
1452465714594566146,those justin bieber memes in like 2011 were justified justin bieber is an awful person,"he then says, “lifting me up, lifting me up, tearing me down.“ This, is discussing the fact that people switch so quickly from liking a celebrity, to canceling them.

1452465714594566146,those justin bieber memes in like 2011 were justified justin bieber is an awful person,He’s never rude to people. Yes there are videos of him refusing to take pictures or getting mad at people for asking him pictures. They are not even his fans they stalk him all day and demand him for a picture.

 * He has an intensely loyal fan base. Justin Bieber has experienced a lot of negative publicity through the years, partly due to general haterism and also due to some bad behavior on his own part (which I would argue isn’t inconsistent with most men in their late teens / early twenties). Yet he has continued to endure and his fans have followed along. A big part of the reason for their loyalty is that Bieber experienced so much ridicule in his younger years for things like his haistyle, small size and adolescent voice that they are used to ignoring negativity directed his way. There’s a reason why his fan base became known as the Beliebers; they really believe in him. Similarly, Bieber himself isn’t bothered by the negative pub because…
 * He really doesn’t take himself too seriously. A lot of haters thought that if they said enough bad stuff about him that they would break him. So they insulted his music, his hair, his voice, his fan base, etc. But he just laughs this stuff off. He laughs off his public gaffes and blunders. He’s willing to get on Saturday Night Live and mock his own image. He’s willing to do a Super Bowl ad for T-Mobile where he dances like a goofball, despite the fact that he can dance significantly better than that. He’s willing to do a silly skit with Drake before the Juno Awards. He is willing to spoof himself in a death scene in Zoolander 2. He does all this stuff because he can laugh at himself. This is important for career longevity, especially in the age of social media where the trolls try their hardest to crush the talented, and they occasionally succeed. Justin Bieber is way above that stuff.",0

 * He works with all the right people. Among singers, rappers, producers and songwriters, Justin Bieber has always worked with the biggest names in a wide variety of genres. Drake, Nicki Minaj, Diplo, Skrillex, Ed Sheeran, DJ Snake, Ludacris, Big Sean, will.i.am., Chris Brown… the list goes on. And he doesn’t just work with the established musicians; sometimes he works with the right up-and-comers. For example, Chance the Rapper emerged as a major rising star in 2016, but Bieber worked with him three years prior on a song . Working with the right people, whether as a featured performer or just singing the verse on a song, is essential for a long career because he stays in-demand and relevant even when he has no solo projects. Also, because Bieber works with a wide variety of musicians, he can leverage his fame into other genres. His name is well known around EDM, R&B, hip hop, and other genres outside of pop.",0

So overall, you have a versatile and talented musician who has already overcome a lot to get to where he is. He cranks out hits that are ahead of his contemporaries and his loyal fan base gladly consumes it. He works with the biggest names in all of pop music and is mentored by Usher.

Justin Bieber was discovered through YouTube and that guy became famous at a very early age. I'd rather say, he had too much too soon, and that, my friend, is the reason that he is not quite humble in his approach. He is often seen to be rude with his fans, letting them down very frequently and getting into major fights with his co-workers and yes, the paparazzi. I personally think that he took the attention that he got from being in an on and off flingy relationship with Selena Gomez as an opportunity to rise higher in the industry with controversies . I used to “love” him when I was 11 but now when I look up to the reality is realise what the it really is.

His career thus far has experienced at least three different phases, and with each phase he has been relevant or even ahead of the curve in terms of emerging styles. As a result, his fan base is growing. People like that don’t just disappear: they usually manage to have long careers.",1
1452465714594566146,those justin bieber memes in like 2011 were justified justin bieber is an awful person,"* First and foremost, Bieber has already accomplished one of the most difficult things that a young star can do, which is to transition from a teen idol into an adult performer. When he first broke onto the scene around 2010, he was a teenager who looked younger than his age, had a prepubescent voice and had a fan base that primarily consisted of preteen girls. By all means, his career should have dead-ended there because the teenybopper stars seldom carry over their success. Instead, he had a graceful physical maturation and he was able to convincingly shift from making kiddie music to making pop music that appeals to a general audience. The jump from kid star to adult star is rough, but the few people who manage to do it - like Justin Timberlake, Beyonce, Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera - are usually enduring entertainers.",1
1452465714594566146,those justin bieber memes in like 2011 were justified justin bieber is an awful person,"* His transition to becoming an adult star was successfully “ushered” along because he is mentored by Usher, who had a similar career arc. Usher began his career in his early teens and became one of the biggest pop stars in the world as an adult. But at one point in his mid-teens, Usher lost his voice because he went through puberty and his voice changed. Many executives at his record label thought his career was over because they feared he would no longer be able to sing. But through patience and perseverence, he was able to find his voice right before his debut album. If you listen to Bieber’s voice on his three main albums - My World, Believe and Purpose - it has been different on each one and he has undergone a significant physical transformation. That’s a tough transition, but it’s much easier when your mentor is one of the biggest stars on the planet and he experienced the same thing.",1

Many people think he’s just a blah singer with a pretty face. Not true. He can play multiple instruments including guitar, trumpet, piano and drums (he’s a very good drummer). As a vocalist, he has continued to expand his repertoire. He can also dance extremely well. As a live performer, he knows how to engage his audience. None of these things happened by accident. These all come from being a serious musician who is willing to push himself.",1

By 1980 she had branched out to form her own act with boyfriend Steve Bray (later a producer on albums like True Blue and Like A Prayer). Despite this bold move, Madonna was floundering. She was living on her wits, relying on favours from friends and had no fixed address. After she became famous, Andy Warhol wrote in his diary: "" Keith (Haring) said that when Madonna was sleeping on his couch, the stories he could write about people she had sex with...""

Madonna persuaded Barbone to come to a concert ( ""She was very flirtatious. She knew I was a gay woman,"" says Barbone), and the latter was ""blown away. She sparkled, in a very street way.

1452441263161049090,"I don't think Madonna is an aggressive Italian, just an attention seeker with a humiliation kink. 💀","Michael Jackson and Madonna attended 1991’s Academy Awards together. While they were dining at a table, some children came along and asked them for their autographs, for what Madonna told them to leave. Michael Jackson had then told her to never speak to children that way. Michael was a ladies’ man. He respected all women equally, but he had a certain preference for clean, quiet, reserved, classy, elegant, and kind women with morals; women who didn’t show too much of their bodies. Madonna didn’t fit that criterion. She spoke her mind out in most cases; she wasn’t considered kind by many; and she was, indeed, a fashion icon, but she generally showed much too of her body. Michael is the greatest philanthropist of all times, 1) because he truly cares, and 2) because he tries to make a change in the world, regardless of not having much in control of the world’s situation. The reason why the incident with the children and Madonna must’ve impacted him by much. That I believe was enough to ruin his image of her, but later on that day, she insisted on going to a strip club, and when he refused to do so, she said they weren’t going to Disneyland either (Michael’s favorite place), even if he had not said a thing about the subject. He would later go on to name a snake after her. You should listen to some of Michael’s private tapes where he discusses her. Thus, he respected her music, but he did not think she was nice.",0

1452441263161049090,"I don't think Madonna is an aggressive Italian, just an attention seeker with a humiliation kink. 💀","Short answer, yes. If you look back at her on-screen career it really isn't all that bad. It's not great, of course, but there are worse. She had the ability (see Dick Tracy, Evita, Dangerous Game) but she didn't always make the best choices for roles (see The Next Best Thing). Some of her box office failures actually weren't her fault but poor choices in directors, co-stars, etc. (see Shanghai Surprise, Who's That Girl, Swept Away). Regardless of who was to blame, Madonna invariably took the heat for her films lack of success. Because she, and she alone, was held to account she simply decided acting was no longer worth the effort and has instead focused on life behind the camera. With two directorial credits under her belt (Filth and Wisdom and the Oscar-nominated W.E.) and two more in the pipeline she is settling into her new role. The question now is how well can she balance her film career while still producing music, raising a family and advancing her various products lines?",0
1452441263161049090,"I don't think Madonna is an aggressive Italian, just an attention seeker with a humiliation kink. 💀","I think it is probably more a case of Hollywood finally realizing that having Madonna star in your film is not worth the risk, and here are the reasons why I think this:",0
1452441263161049090,"I don't think Madonna is an aggressive Italian, just an attention seeker with a humiliation kink. 💀","1. Madonna Cannot Act: Madonna just isn’t a good actress. Her performances usually come across as hollow and lacking in emotion or range. She usually appears vacant or dead behind the eyes. There have been glimpses of potential throughout her film performances, notably in “Evita” and “Dangerous Game” but they were too fleeting to help her sustain any sort of momentum.
2. She’s Box Office Poison: Madonna’s films have just not made money. Most of her films have been complete failures financially. “A League of Their Own” is an exception, but she is barely in the movie long-enough to call it a “Madonna film.”
3. She’s Horrible To Work With: Madonna is famously difficult to work with, has a bad attitude and is a raging narcissist (even by Hollywood standards): Reputations whether fairly earned or not can often play a role in getting job offers in Hollywood, and Madonna’s reputation is one that she has never been able to shake. She’s seen by many as aggressive, rude, difficult and frankly just not worth the trouble.
4. She’s Older: Madonna isn’t in her 20’s anymore and is over 50 years old, there just aren’t many role available for actresses over 40 and considering all the other strikes against her its doubtful she’d be first on any producer or directors list of actresses they’d consider for their movie. Why risk your movie on casting a wild card like Madonna when you can get a more reliable actress like Glenn Close, Meryl Streep or Susan Sarandon?
5. She’s Very Busy: Between raising her huge family and her commitments to her musical career and her political and social activism Madonna is a very busy woman and perhaps just doesn’t have the time or interest to pursue acting anymore.",0

1452428274374696963,kanye west is a piece of shit lmao so is bo burnam but im surprised kanye is even an option,"* He really is a narcissistic asshole — he’s not faking it (putting aside his mental health issues).
 * The best art is truthful and authentic -%3E reflects who you really are, what you’ve experienced in life, and how you feel about those experiences.
 * Over time, it gets increasingly difficult for super-successful musicians to generate great new songs. Their first album/early music was often born from hardship, hard work, worries, poverty. But once success comes, life gets better / there’s less adversity. So what do you write about?
 * And regardless of your success, it’s simply difficult to stay creatively fertile. Just because you crushed it on your first two albums — which reflected ideas that were pent-up for many years — doesn’t guarantee that you come up with 2–5 great new songs every two years forever.
 * So having exciting life experiences that you can write about in your songs is pretty useful. This is why — in part — rappers have beefs and Taylor Swift doesn’t necessarily mind messy public breakups.
 * In other words, Kanye can write more interesting material by being an asshole in his songs and by being an asshole in the real world, which he can then describe in songs.
 * And his fans don’t seem to mind his crazy/insulting behavior. They seem to like it; music aside, it doesn’t seem to hurt his reputation or marketing appeal.
 * Also, it’s fun and productive for Kanye to take advantage of full superstar narcissism to create superhero-celebrity life experiences that nobody else can match. Who else can get into a huge Twitter fight with Taylor Swift? Who else can get invited to Trump Tower by Trump himself? What other hip hop artist can say that he wants to run for president?
 * By contrast, if you listen to Ed Sheeran’s new music, it sorta feels like… hey he’s a really nice guy who now doesn’t have many problems; life is good and he’s kind to others — pretty tough to find inspiration for new music!
 * But I don’t mean to overstate this or sound like Kanye is super-purposeful/ utilitarian. To simplify this idea, I suspect Kanye is an asshole because: (1) he can be one, without it hurting him commercially or artistically, (2) he isn’t compromising personal integrity by being an asshole; in fact, he’s being super-authentic, (3) it’s fun, and (4) it often makes his music better.",0

Bush was a racist. People forget Kayne has had a lot of help from Dave Chapelle too. Again, luck. If you knew Dave Chapelle, you'd be famous too. Apart from that, the beats are so so. Any teenager can take a pop baseline, and attach it to a beat. I guess a lot of people don't know that that is essentially what modern hip hop has devolved into, taking pop music, and adding a hook. It's not impressive in the least. The guy is rich, so you all love him though. That's all it is.",0

1452428274374696963,kanye west is a piece of shit lmao so is bo burnam but im surprised kanye is even an option,"Firstly, I think that the idea of a ‘celebrity’ has been blown out of proportion big-time by the media. A bunch of normal yet talented people are thrown into the spotlight so much that the media tries to persuade us that they are responsible for world issues and must have a view on everything (usually expected to be politically-correct with the sensitivities of Twitter and social media as a whole) when in reality, they are just people with jobs that give them a lot of screen-time in our lives. So as a celebrity, you could care about Kanye but I wouldn’t say he’s that important from that perspective.",0

Well, you could, it is subjective after all, but from a musical perspective, he manipulates samples, uses word-play and touches upon topics in a remarkable way. I’d definitely say his Grammys are worth it. For some, his personality is overwhelming, angry and like a rollercoaster however all I can see is a man who went from beinn insecure to using his music to boost his self-esteem through the roof, this can make some people uncomfortable and misunderstanding of him of course. So should we care about him as an artist? I would say that if you’re looking for inspiration from an artist that has confidence coming out of his ears, then you should definitely care.",0

He had a great outlook on things regarding corporates and has had a taste of what it’s like to be a real American rather than the 1% at the top. (Although, I can’t agree with all his views) When I found out he was bi-polar, I realised it may not be the job for him. Should we care about him as a president? 100% because whether you believe in his manifesto or not, he will either be used as a way to get Trump in for another couple years or it will not be stable to have a bipolar president in office.",0

When they talk to you, do not reply or do so with dismissal. Look and talk over them as if they were an ant in your way. Whenever they try to get a rise out of you, do what you’d do if a baby tugged on your hair. Smile playfully, and walk away. Few people can stand the insult of not being recognized.
2. Never respond emotionally. In any conflict, the first person to respond with emotion is the lower status victim. Treat every abuse as a business transaction. Speak calmly, do not stutter, do not use too many words with them. Let them be emotional and look like fools.
3. When they attack in a serious manner, respond casually. When they attack you in a casual manner, respond seriously. This way you assume your frame on the situation instead of letting them push your into their frame.

Breathe through your stomach and remind yourself to take breaks.
 * Don’t be afraid to lose others’ attention when you pause. Breaks make the listener curious about what’s going to come next.
 * Avoid apologizing all the time. Reserve the word “sorry” for when you are really sorry. I know, this a habit and therefore takes some time and effort to get rid of, but it will make you a more confident communicator.
 * Get rid of all these little ‘void fillers’ such as “ahm”, “a”, or “uhm”.
 * Decide on what you want to say. Then say it with confidence. E.g., when you are talking about the economy but you aren’t sure anymore if GDP growth over the last quarter was 2% or 3% just decide on one and say it as if it was a fact. Trust me, no one is going to fact check you if you seem confident in what you are saying.

 * If you have bad posture from slouching in an office chair all day, make sure you start strengthening your core muscles. To have good posture you need a strong core.
 * Slow down. All of these jerky movements, that so many guys make when nervous, will only make you look insecure and raise the chances of you tripping or knocking stuff over.

By thinking about others, we practically give the power or key to our happiness to others. Their reactions, their opinions decide our mood. We have control only over ourselves & not others. What we can do is direct our energy in ways that will make us better version each day.
2. Thinking about others means you have given too much access or allowed intrusion to that person over your moves, actions & decisions. That is not healthy.
3. Do you see that by overthinking, you are letting the other person manipulate you into believing what he wants you to believe? He can make you lose your belief & get you to regret. You let him overbear on you . You do things so that he does not feel bad, so that you are in his good books.
4. Thinking about someone’s actions that did not align with your beliefs and values can result in developing frustration, anger, grudge for that person. The negative emotions are always a burden. They occupy space in your memory & damage your well being.
5. You may decide the course, your destination, your goals based on others’ judgment of you. Example:Someone thought you are not good at something, you decided that it is not your cup of tea & gave up on that. You generalized as if he is your fortune teller and his conclusion of one action of yours decides you could not be good at it ever. You stop pursuing it. Do you see that by doing this, you are giving up on your potential?
6. You spend your resources, your time, energy & whatever is there at your disposal to winover that person. While the other person goes on with his life. You have lost but the other person gains by being focussed on what he wanted to do.
7. By overthinking about others, you are becoming insecure about yourself.

But, if you're poor, it's especially important that you keep yourself, your home, and your vehicle neat and clean. You must also be careful about your demeanor and how you carry yourself, if you are poor. People initially only see what you show them, so if you want to be treated with respect, you must also show them that you are respectful. Be articulate when you speak, don't use too much slang or profanity; and people will automatically give you a certain amount of respect from the get-go. Having good command over language is an immediate sign of an educated, and respectable person. Always address older people and people of authority as “sir” or “ma'am” until they tell you to call them by a different name; this is also an immediate sign that you are a respectful person deserving of respect.",0

Nice use of ""retarded,"" though.","Why is it especially important to keep yourself and your stuff clean and in good order if you are poor? Because how you care for yourself and your belongings says just as much about you as what you have. So, if you can only afford to drive a clunker that's 15 years old, that's okay. Keep your ride waxed, clean, and running well. People will see that you drive an old car, but notice that you take care of what you have; and that's something that people with money will respect. Most wealthy people didn't get to where they are overnight, but did so because they saved their money and took care of what they had until they could afford something better...If you live in a crappy apartment in the ghetto, that's okay too; keep your place organized and clean, and your guests and visitors will respect your home. If you can't afford many clothes, buy good quality (not necessarily the most expensive) pieces, and keep them cleaned, ironed, and sharp. Don't wear clothes that are ripped, stained, or don't fit properly; people will take that as a sign of poverty even if you aren't poor. Sagging pants, skin-tight shirts etc. will send the wrong message to people. Regardless of the fact that it's wrong to judge people based on their appearance, that's what people do. So if you want respect, show people that you are more than “just another poor person”.",0

I mean, liberty rules over all other values. Especially against the state. For libertarians the state must be reduced to a minimum. Interesting, this is also the final purpose of communism. In the real world people enjoy a lot of freedom only in those countries where the ruling elites are commutable to the people. We know them by the term “democracies”. All democracies have strong institutions, who in turn protect people’s freedom. You just cannot have freedom without a strong state. But true, you can have a strong state and no freedom (China comes to mind).
2. Libertarianism presumes that humans are selfish, conniving, rational robots, interested only in their own selfish interests. But somehow, this egotistic pleasure seekers do not need rules and enforcers. The society regulates itself. The state is not needed. In the real world, humans act irrational all the time. Smoking, for example, is a very damaging occupation. Plenty of people smoke. There is no reason behind it, they just do. In my country, Romania, 20 years ago you could smoke in hospitals in the ward rooms. 5 years ago you could still smoke in the hallway, near the elevators. This is stupid and we need rules to ban this kind of stuff.
3. Libertarianism is favourable to laissez faire capitalism and considers taxes as theft. “Laissez faire” is a defunct economic theory born in the brain of a French philosopher 300 year ago. He believed that wealth circulated like blood inside the body. So, you should let it circulate (laissez faire) and not stop it with laws, regulations, subsidies and tariffs. It is a good way to describe a agricultural, medieval economy. You do not need many regulation in an economy made from cows, sheep, grain, wine and mud huts. However, our economy, 300 years later, is a fuckton more complicated. The other important sentence is “taxes are theft”. It was born inside the brain of “geniuses” like Murray Rothbard. This guy was an economist who opposed central banking, fiat money and fractional reserve banking but, wait for it, he was in favour of the gold standard. Presumably, because it worked 100 years ago, and we should drive forward our society by looking in the rear-view mirror. In the real world, taxes are not theft. Taxes finance all thing useful around us: roads, schools, the army, the police, healthcare, garbage disposal, research, and so many many more. Think at taxes as an asset protection insurance. Even if you are a bum living in a card box under a bridge you still have assets: your life, your health, your clothes and maybe a pot or two. Taxes protect your assets. You got ill, you go to emergency services and they treat you. If somebody robs your pots, you can take your case to the police and the courts. Without taxes, there is no wealth. We go back into the jungle.
In conclusion yes, libertarianism is pseudo-intellectual. It is a superficial, made up, skin deep words play that cannot face the facts of real world. Libertarianism pretends to be a great thing for all the people. Communism did that, too.",0

And Cajun cooking is some gooooooooood crap. I’m jealous of those homosexuals…nobody in Houma would cook home-cooked meals for me when I even lived in South Lousiana.",0

If people who are very vocal about being muslims are murdering homosexuals, and (in Sudan) murdering Christians, then “Islam” as an organized religion CAN NOT be peaceful. It is necessarily either fallible just like all the other religions (Catholicism and Inquisition, Buddhists and the current Rohingya crisis, Jews and King David/Bathsheba, Egyptians and most of the Pharaoic period), or its purpose does not acknowledge peace as a tenet and peacefulness or war simply flows from whatever other decisions it makes.
2. If Islam as an organized religion run by humans exists as an aggressor in a measurable percentage of the world, then All Muslims cannot be peaceful zealots of a “religion of Peace.”
3. All Muslims in America and Palestine cannot be assumed to be “peaceful” or “victims”.
4. If not all Muslims can be assume to be peaceful or compassionate or non-bigoted against homosexuals and those of other religions, or can be assumed to be Pro-Choice (I should have thrown that one in there in Logical Step #1).

1452367685938032641,I hate amber heard. Vile person.,"I read through most of the judge’s summary from the most recent trial. The outcome is that at the very least, Depp is very likely an abuser. The judge upheld 12 out of 14 claims of physical abuse that The Sun and Amber Heard raised in their defence. The judge took the view that it was not the purpose of the trial to determine if Heard herself was an abuser (that was not the scope of the case), however he looked at the allegations Depp raised against her and found them unlikely to be true. Many of the accusations Depp raised, such as Heard cutting off his finger, or shitting in his bed, to be unlikely when looked at in detail. Also, even in incidents where Heard’s side admits to doing violent things, such as throwing a bottle, the judge pointed out that based on the evidence it was Depp who far more often threw things and damaged property.",0
1452367685938032641,I hate amber heard. Vile person.,"Prior to the outcome of the case, I raised the possibility that both were in a mutually abusive relationship. The outcome of the trial has caused me to revise that to something more nuanced. I think it is likely that both have been abusive, however Depp is far more abusive of the two. Heard is no perfect victim, but to frame her as the primary instigator, schemer, abuser, or anything of that sort just shows a flagrant disregard for the details of the case.",0

Instead of evaluating their own assumptions, they’ve decided there must be something wrong with the courts; that Depp’s side couldn’t possibly have made bad arguments, let alone actually been abusive. And whilst I won’t rule out the possibility of bad decision making on the part of any judge, I think it is pathetic that so many people watched a couple of youtube videos and decided they know better than a judge who has every bit of evidence to consult.",0

He has two children, and is now 55 years old.

She’s shown narcissistic and controlling behavior, not to mention she's had several run ins with the law, one where she falsified documents but blamed it on being ‘sleep deprived”.

And there's nothing wrong with liking older successful men/women, but it doesn't give you a very nice track record when you ask your so called abusive ex husband for 50k a month (to maintain that classy and expensive life style Depp introduced her too), while getting into a relationship with a billionaire not even two and half months later.",0

He’s walking around, slamming a few doors, he throws a wine glass into the sink. It smashes. Probably angry, yes. Not an angel, but that isn’t abuse. His so-called supportive wife sits there sipping coffee, re-angling the camera to get a better shot whilst repeatedly prodding him with questions when his situation most likely hasn’t got anything to do with her. She makes it about herself. Even when he notices the camera he is calmer than I would have been. He places the wine glass down before grabbing her phone.

This is sickening to me. They are so blase about murdering that they refer to the hit list photos as ""baseball cards"". Killing is a game or a sport to them. There is a ""cancer on the Presidency"" and that cancer has metastasized throughout Washington DC. It was there before Obama arrived but he brought a whole new and virulent strain with him. Every time there is a shameful incident or embarrassing event perpetrated by ""a few bad apples"" we hear from the DC psychopaths that ""That is not who we are"". They are incorrect. It is who they are in DC. It is not who we the real everyday thinking feeling Americans are.

Imagine no struggles with shame, not a single one in your whole life, no matter what kind of selfish, lazy, harmful, or immoral action you had taken. And pretend that the concept of responsibility is unknown to you, except as a burden others seem to accept without question, like gullible fools. Now add to this strange fantasy the ability to conceal from other people that your psychological makeup is radically different from theirs. Since everyone simply assumes that conscience is universal among human beings, hiding the fact that you are conscience-free is nearly effortless. You are not held back from any of your desires by guilt or shame, and you are never confronted by others for your cold-bloodedness. The ice water in your veins is so bizarre, so completely outside of their personal experience that they seldom even guess at your condition.

People like Robben are nothing before Neymar [ https://www.quora.com/topic/Neymar-Jr-footballer ] in this particular skill.
 * Most selfish player in the top tier(0.00001%). Neymar’s terrible decisions in the interest of scoring are costing him and his teams. His last game against Real Madrid(CL 2018) is a classic example.
 * Ball and glory Hog. I got so much hate for saying this but I say it again. FFS, realize that you’re already regarded as the best footballer after those two.
 * Forget about winning, he lost fans because of his silly fights with Cavani, Semedo and other colleagues.
 * Neymar doesn’t respect his opponents. I guess you have some classic examples for this. Neymar had done it time and again with Barcelona and PSG.
PS : Football fans like me enjoy(or used to) his games because he is a genius at ball. But his on-field instincts like diving, fighting etc makes it less fun to watch him play. Most of the times I already know he is going to go down whenever someone comes close to him.",0

1452335430217707525,"Pessi roaming would benefit them, Neymar is fat he can't play on the wings so it understandable.. https://t.co/QhnHStggcW","* The aforementioned Olympic gold. To avoid competition with the World Cup, FIFA restricted the participation in the Olympic games to U-23 players, except for a cap of 3 23+ players per team. Because of that, internacional football stars usually see the Olympic games as a tournament for young players, and would never prioritize it against their professional leagues. Since Brazil had suprisingly never won the Olympic gold in football, and was going to host the 2016 games, Neymar put that as his main personal goal, and de-prioritized his Spanish league duties to make sure he was part of the Olympic team, and did lead Brazil to its first gold.
 * Neymar appeared as a rising star in Santos (the same team Pelé used to play) when he was 17, and he showed so much promise that, less than a year after his professional debut, and before he even turned 18, there was a significant popular demand for including him in the national team that played the 2010 World Cup. Most players in that situation would’ve transferred to Europe immediately, if they hadn’t done so before - Messi was already in Barcelona before the age of 14. Neymar, on the contrary, decided to stay in Santos long enough to be recognized as a great player in his own country, and led Santos to their third Copa Libertadores title (the other two having been won when Pelé still played).
 * He always shown utmost commitment to playing on the national team, and, in his seven years in the “seleção”, he scored 57 goals in 90 appearances, won one Confederation Cup, an Olympic gold and one silver, and scored 6 goals in 10 World Cup matches (with only one loss, against Belgium in 2018).
So why isn’t Neymar as respected as he should be? There are several reasons, but my interpretation is that this isn’t specific to Neymar, but to the general attitude of the Brazilians with respect to their heroes. Some other answers here pointed to Neymar being a Brazilian version to the “American dream” of the “self-made man”, which he actually is, having come from humble origins to become one of the top 5 players in the world.",0

There's a kind of myth towards people who came out of nothing to become one of the best of the world in his area, with all the fame, beautiful girlfriend, tremendous money, prestige and success this brings along. This is not so appealing to the middle class, which understands that education is the best path to social success and is privileged enough to get a share of this success through honest persistent hard work, nor is that appealing to the wealthy, who have less to envy about Neymar. But to the poor, uneducated ones who don't get any chances of social ascension, marginalized from the “developed"" side of Brazil, boy, this is more than appealing. It becomes part of their soul and their life goals - they dream to be another Neymar - someone capable of getting to the heights of success doing what he loves to do - and keep dreaming until adulthood when they finally discover that the chances of being successful and rich by playing soccer - unless a very unlikely combination of factors which translate into a tremendous coupling of talent, knowing the right people, lots of discipline and sheer luck ensues - are virtually zero.",0

Moreover not having  a muscular physique has its own merits.  Messi has superb dribbling speed, Amazing one on one skills, The best CHIP shots. This is all because he has a low centre of gravity it is easier for him to balance and dribble past defenders. which may be a bit tedious for someone  with a muscular physique.

The fiery statement, which describes McConnell as a ""dour, sullen, and unsmiling political hack,"" comes after the Senate GOP leader accused Trump of bearing responsibility for the deadly Capitol riot. Trump, whose once-prolific online presence has been muzzled by multiple social media companies, claimed in a statement from his political action committee that McConnell's ""dedication to business as usual"" will lead to further Republican losses.",0

""Where necessary and appropriate, I will back primary rivals who espouse Making America Great Again and our policy of America First."" The statement, which came three days after Trump was acquitted in an unprecedented second impeachment trial, highlights a widening rift in the GOP over what role the former president ought to play in the party. Trump, who maintains high approval among Republicans, had previously signaled he would remain active in politics. Seven Republican senators voted to convict Trump on one article of inciting the Jan. 6 invasion of the Capitol, making it the most bipartisan impeachment trial vote ever. But the votes for conviction fell below two-thirds of the chamber, resulting in acquittal. While McConnell voted ""not guilty"" in the impeachment trial, he has denounced Trump's conduct leading up to the Capitol riot. Minutes after the trial concluded, McConnell said on the Senate floor that Trump ""is practically and morally responsible for provoking"" the attack. McConnell doubled down in an op-ed for The Wall Street Journal published Monday evening, slamming Trump's ""unconscionable"" behavior during and after the invasion while defending his vote for acquittal. In his statement, Trump did not address the attack on the Capitol that led to his second impeachment.",0

But Josh Holmes, McConnell's former chief of staff, said in a tweet: ""The most amusing part of this Trump letter is all the journos who told us Trump's words were dangerous and should be deplatformed are now wallpapering Twitter with them as soon as he attacks Republicans."" Trump, who lost the White House to President Joe Biden after a single term, blamed McConnell for losing Republican control of the Senate by pushing a too-small offer on direct payments in a coronavirus relief package. ""I single-handedly saved at least 12 Senate seats,"" Trump claimed, ""and then came the Georgia disaster, where we should have won both U.S. Senate seats, but McConnell matched the Democrat offer of $2,000 stimulus checks with $600. How does that work?"" Trump spent the days before Georgia's Senate runoff elections spreading unfounded conspiracy theories that widespread fraud led to Biden's narrow win in the state. Shortly before those runoffs, news outlets published audio of a phone call showing Trump pressuring Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to ""find"" the votes needed for him to win the state's presidential election. One attorney allied with Trump had also encouraged Republicans to boycott the runoffs. Trump's statement also blamed Georgia's Republican governor, Brian Kemp, as well as Raffensperger and the Republican Party itself, for losing the Peach State runoffs. Trump appeared to resurface his false claims of election fraud by accusing those officials of ""not doing [their] job on Election Integrity during the 2020 Presidential race."" Trump also accused McConnell of having ""no credibility on China because of his family's substantial Chinese business holdings."" McConnell's wife, Elaine Chao, immigrated to the U.S. from Taiwan at a young age. She served as Trump's Transportation secretary until January, when she quit his Cabinet one day after the then-president's supporters stormed the Capitol. A campaign ad from McConnell's former political opponent Amy McGrath had made a similar connection between McConnell's wealth and China. The Washington Post called that ad ""grossly misleading,"" and McConnell's campaign called it racist. Trump's statement also claimed that McConnell, who has won reelection every six years since 1990, would have ""lost badly"" without his endorsement. Trump said that providing that endorsement is his ""only regret.""",0

He advocates for a larger amount of campaign funds in politics because “[he] wants to win.” He blames past democratic administrations for foreign policy blunders in the Mid-East, when it is very much a fallacious standpoint to take to blame the actions of one political party for a complex topic (it’s probably 65%/35%, reps. and dems., respectively). He restricts abortion access (which I agree that abortion is morally wrong) but turns a blind eye to foreign and domestic human rights abuses (Uighur genocide, Rohingya cleansing, U.S. southern border situation). He falsely associates the expansion of the welfare state in the late 70s and early 80s with the socioeconomic disenfranchisement of black and brown communities (c.c. the Iran-Contra Affair, which introduced the drug trade into U.S. urban areas; it was transparently the responsibility of the Reagan administration and was swept under the rug by Bill Barr under Bush 41).

A usual Saturday and I sat down to watch the match,
""So who is this guy?"" my girlfriend asked, as he sure seemed like a catch,
Saying that she sat beside me as I sensed a trap,
Today was the day she had chosen to ignore the usual Twilight crap,
As she had never followed football I answered ""No one baby Just some random guy"",
To make her leave I had to try,
As he stood to take a free kick outside the box,

Why do some players and their money grabbing agents believe they are indispensable? The graveyards are full of indispensable people. Pogba is beginning to remind me of Balotelli and Anelka and look what happened to them. Probably why Sir Alex let him him go the first time and if still in charge would have said no thanks. He is a disruptive influence so maybe it would be better to let him go. As for bringing back Ronaldo? Why?

• Apparently Ronaldo avoids tattoos as this would bar him from giving blood and this is something he does regularly.
• He’s a charitable cunt.According to some website or other Ronaldo was named in 2015 as the world’s most charitable sportsperson:he donated his €600,000 Champions League win bonus to good causes.

That development was foreshadowed by months of news reports that didn't find a direct link, either. However, the investigation isn't over yet, and the two Christie associates directly tied to the lane closures -- David Wildstein of the Port Authority and Bridget Kelly, the deputy chief of staff who was with Christie when emailing ""Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee -- could ""flip"" and provide more information about the state of the governor's awareness. Also, in the same mode of Watergate in which President Nixon was never personally tied to the original break-in, the question still lingers about the GWB: What made two close associates of Christie think that such a harmful and probably illegal act would please the governor, their boss?",0

The laundry list includes allegations that Hoboken was denied Sandy relief monies when the mayor declined to endorse Christie, that other Sandy funds were doled out to friends and supporters despite little or no link to storm damage, that federal dollars paid for a Sandy-related tourism campaign that featured the governor and his family and boosted his re-election, and that his close ally named to head the Port Authority used the post to enrich his law firm.

• None David Wildstein, then the Port Authority's director of interstate capital projects. Wildstein executed the lane closures, and joked that children stuck in traffic in Fort Lee were the children of Buono voters (referring to Christie's opponent in the election, Barbara Buono). Before his appointment to the Port Authority, Wildstein founded the website Politics NJ, where he wrote blog entries under the pseudonym Wally Edge. He was a year ahead of Christie at Livingston High School, and later served as mayor of Livingston for one term. Wildstein pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy in May 2015.
• None Bridget Kelly, then Christie's deputy chief of staff focusing on intergovernmental affairs. She wrote the original email to Wildstein that said, ""time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee."" Her office was focused on working with local officials. The Christie administration's internal report puts the blame for the scandal on Kelly and Wildstein. Kelly was indicted on multiple counts of conspiracy, but has pleaded not guilty.
• None Bill Baroni, then the Port Authority's deputy executive director, its top operational official from New Jersey. In texts to his subordinate Wildstein, Baroni mockingly referred to Fort Lee's mayor, Mark Sokolich as Serbia, and would not respond when the mayor asked for help with the traffic. In November 2013, Baroni gave inaccurate testimony to a committee of New Jersey legislators, repeatedly asserting that the lane closures were part of a traffic study. The Christie administration's internal review found no evidence that Baroni knew of the ulterior motive behind the lane closures in advance. Baroni, a former New Jersey state senator, wrote a book called Fat Kid Got Fit: And So Can You! about his struggles with obesity in his younger years.

1452260993585844231,"Nicki Minaj Is a racist cunt, looking like queen Elizabeth the first with that ginger hair . Her big ass head prolly sweating under that ugly ass wig #standojacat","The White Gaze and Black Female Identity in American Popular Music Central to the process of racial formation in the United States has been the structuring power of the white gaze.Footnote 2 Since the advent of European colonialism, it has played a formative role in the making of American society, constructing whiteness and Eurocentric conceptions of the world as normative and superior and portraying non-white perspectives and cultural practices as deviant and inferior. Patricia Hill Collins argues that it has functioned as a part of “technologies of control” in Western societies for centuries. She notes that during Jim Crow, segregationist policies “recognized that all Whites had the power to pinion all Blacks with the power of the White gaze,” and that this phenomenon continues today in more subtle and unverbalized forms.Footnote 3 Bell hooks draws attention to the unequal, one-way nature of this relationship: “White people can ‘safely’ imagine that they are invisible to black people since the power they have historically asserted, and even now collectively assert over black people, accorded them the right to control the black gaze.”Footnote 4 The effects of the white gaze on black communities and individuals have been manifold. Shanette M. Harris highlights its contribution to ingrained internal racism in African American communities, where it has elicited “feelings of shame, hypervigilance, self-criticism, social anxiety, and in general, negative and uncomfortable feelings toward the self.”Footnote 5 Scholars have drawn particular attention to its contradictory construction of blackness as a source of violence, anxiety, suspicion, sexual attraction, and fascination. George Yancy characterizes the white gaze as being “inextricably bound up with objectifying, exoticizing, and sexualizing the Black body, inscribing it with myths and codes that function to ontologize it, thus returning it as that which it is not.”Footnote 6 Harris argues that it conceives of black bodies as “symbolic representation and fantasy” and constructs “stereotypical images and societal barriers” to deal with the resulting emotions of anxiety and desire.Footnote 7 Today, it continues to reduce black men and women to a series of contradictory stereotypes: objects of both fear and fascination—alternately violent and lascivious, invisible yet impossible to ignore. Yancy characterizes these attitudes as all encompassing and destructive to positive black identity. He argues that successful efforts to transform perceptions of blacks must ultimately undermine the white gaze and challenge “whiteness as fanaticism.”Footnote 8 The gaze black women have had to contend with is not only white, but male as well. The “double jeopardy” created by racism and patriarchy has generated a unique set of obstacles to black female empowerment and self-actualization.Footnote 9 United States culture has historically portrayed black women as alternately transgressive, primitive, hostile, and hypersexual.Footnote 10 Stereotypes with roots in the era of slavery, such as the “Jezebel”—a sexualized caricature of working-class black women—still endure today.Footnote 11 As Theresa Renee White notes, such portrayals have existed in the realm of popular entertainment as well: to many American white men, black female performers from Josephine Baker to Beyoncé have long represented “extreme, disproportionate sexuality.”Footnote 12 Cornel West emphasizes these stereotypes’ essentially conflicted nature: on one hand, prevailing notions of black female sexual prowess portray black women as sought-after sexual partners; on the other hand, dominant ideals of white feminine beauty render black women as inferior to their white counterparts.Footnote 13 He argues that these myths both degrade black women and devalue woman in general, and concludes that they are “part of a wider network of white supremacist lies whose authority and legitimacy must be undermined.”Footnote 14 Stereotypically sexualized representations of black female identity informed by the white male gaze have existed in the American popular music sphere since nineteenth-century blackface minstrelsy, which presented black women as both objects of forbidden white male desire and grotesque, masculinized targets of ridicule. The most prominent example of this was the provocative and tragic mulatto “wench” character, who was typically played by a white male in drag and blackface alongside other staple characters such as Jim Crow and Zip Coon. These portrayals were the first of many widely disseminated stereotypical constructions of black female identity in American popular music culture. Various scholars have drawn a link between the lascivious manner in which such black female characters in minstrelsy were portrayed and an anxious yet powerful attraction to black sexuality on the part of white male viewers.Footnote 15 Eric Lott makes the connection between this phenomenon and the white gaze explicit: “One might, after Laura Mulvey, call this dynamic the “pale gaze”—a ferocious investment in demystifying and domesticating black power in white fantasy by projecting vulgar black types as spectacular objects of white men's looking. This looking always took place in relation to an objectified and sexualized black body, and it was often conjoined to a sense of terror.”Footnote 16 Lott draws particular attention to the conflicted, homoerotic nature of this attraction, noting that “white men were routinely encouraged to indulge in fantasies about black women—which, however, highlighted, and implicitly identified them with, the salacious black male characters who ‘authored’ the fantasies, confusing the real object of sexual interest.”Footnote 17 Their enduring power was such that almost all black performers performed in blackface and incorporated minstrel tropes and performance practices at least through the early twentieth century.Footnote 18 Black female musicians have developed a variety of rhetorical and performative strategies in response to these portrayals in order to both challenge the gaze and create “discourses in opposition to the dominant representations of black femininity.”Footnote 19 They serve largely to counter “widely held assumptions of black female inferiority” and have existed since the era of slavery in various forms.Footnote 20 Female hip-hop artists are playing central roles in this endeavor. Cheryl Keyes argues that women rappers draw from a long line of female artists, dating back to 1920s-era blues singers such as Bessie Smith and Ma Rainey, who have worked to articulate distinct black female subjectivities and establish alternative, empowering constructions of black female identity.Footnote 21 Black women rappers have adapted a diverse set of personas and identities in their performances and public rhetoric. Keyes identifies four primary categories: the matriarchal and Afrocentric “Queen Mother” (e.g., Queen Latifah, Sister Souljah); the independent and sexually frank “Fly Girl” (e.g., Salt-N-Pepa, TLC); the more overtly oppositional and assertive “Sista With Attitude” (e.g., Da Brat, Mia X); and the anti-heteronormative “Lesbian” (e.g., Me’Shell Ndegeocello, Queen Pen).Footnote 22 These categories are by no means exclusive: Keyes notes that figures such as Lil’ Kim and Foxy Brown, for instance, combined aspects of both the Fly Girl and the Sista with Attitude.Footnote 23 She argues that these figures enable rap music to become “a vehicle by which black female rappers seek empowerment, make choices, and create spaces for themselves and other sistas.”Footnote 24 Out of the variety of responses from listeners and scholars these figures have faced, sexually straightforward and unapologetically erotic performances by woman rappers have generated some of the most contentious reactions. Although overtly sexual self-presentation has been a major aspect of female hip-hop performance since the late 1980s, when women in groups such as Salt-N-Pepa began to dress in clothing that emphasized their bodies and spoke openly about issues related to sex, by the mid-1990s, with the advent of gangsta rap and more frequently sexualized portrayals of black women in music videos, these self-portrayals became increasingly explicit. This change took place as part of a broader “new wave of black women addressing matters of sexuality in the mainstream public sphere” that took place in 1990s hip-hop.Footnote 25 Figures such as Shawnna, Lil’ Kim, Mia X, Trina, Lady of Rage, and Foxy Brown incorporated explicit lyrics throughout their raps and portrayed themselves in a more erotic and provocative manner than previous female rappers. Lil’ Kim became particularly well known for this aesthetic, which she often used to discuss her body in hypersexual terms or present herself in a position of sexual dominance. In her 2003 single “Magic Stick,” which she released as a “battle of the sexes” song with 50 Cent, Kim rapped about forcing men to perform oral sex on her “magic clit”—a reversal of the common rap trope of women performing oral sex on men—and boasted about being a “freak to the core.” She received particular notoriety later in her career for performing with breast implants and blonde hair extensions and marketing herself as “Black Barbie.” This aesthetic continues to define much of mainstream hip-hop performance, most notably in the music of multiplatinum artist Nicki Minaj, the most popular female rapper in the late 2000s and early 2010s, who has received widespread attention for following many of the tropes Kim and Brown introduced, including an erotic self-presentation and an (ironic) self-characterization as “Barbie.” Artists such as Kim and Minaj have received mixed responses from scholars. On one hand, some praise such figures for reclaiming black female expressions of sexuality in a cultural environment that has historically policed such expressions.Footnote 26 Rana A. Emerson, for instance, argues that this kind of self-presentation offers the opportunity to return the male gaze and reappropriate the black female body in order to express an independent, empowered sexual subjectivity.Footnote 27 Jason Haugen asserts that rappers such as Lil’ Kim, Mia X, and Lady of Rage construct resistant alternative black female identities that claim meaningful social power. He asserts that they are able to construct “a novel kind of femininity” that introduces alternative conceptions of female identity to both the traditionally male-dominated sphere of hip-hop and conventional American conceptions of propriety.Footnote 28 At the same time, many critics and scholars decry these artists’ performances as pornographic, demeaning, and conforming to male-dictated images of women.Footnote 29 Rather than challenging or transforming perceptions of black female sexuality, critics charge, such hypersexualized portrayals only reinforce dominant racist and patriarchal structures of power.Footnote 30 In discussing the late-1990s work of rapper Foxy Brown, Stephanie Dunn argues that while in many ways Brown's self-presentation affirmed dark-skinned African American beauty, her image “did not offer an image of black femininity that transgressed stereotypes of black femininity or the traditional performance of sexuality by black women in popular entertainment.”Footnote 31 Joan Morgan asserts that the standard Kim and Brown introduced ultimately limited artists: I think that it is empowering to the individual, but, to me, feminism is not about empowering the individual . . . I would say that Kim and Foxy's experience has helped, in many ways, to narrow the kind of rappers that we even get to see put on in the game. The fact that they were not the first rappers to go platinum, but the first to come out of the box and sell at that level—they became the prototype for what the industry considered a woman rapper who could sell. We have seen a narrowing of the kind of female rappers that are able to come out ever since.Footnote 32 Azealia Banks herself acknowledged an early desire to follow in Lil’ Kim's footsteps, but maintained that she ultimately decided to “find something else completely. . . . It's been done, and it's being done again. What would I be adding to the world by doing it too?” Indeed, despite the purposeful relation of certain elements of her persona to previous women rapper figures—in Keyes's terms, the Fly Girl, Sista with Attitude, and the Lesbian—in both her performance in “212” and her public rhetoric, Banks introduces a new articulation of the figure of the female rapper altogether, with ramifications both in the market and in the realm of politics.Footnote 33",0

Her big ass head prolly sweating under that ugly ass wig #standojacat","Originally from Harlem, Banks (b. 1991) achieved limited success before the release of “212.” From 2009 to 2010, she released several songs on YouTube and SoundCloud, delivered a featured rap on electronic dancehall group Major Lazer's album Lazers Never Die, and held a position as a Harlem “borough ambassador” for Nike's 1LOVE advertising campaign. Banks's best-known pre-“212” single, “L8R,” which she released as a music video on YouTube in 2010, follows many of the tropes found in the works of hip-hop artists such as Lil’ Kim and Nicki Minaj. Most significantly, the song's music video, directed by Maxim Bohichik and Alex Bergman, largely adheres to conventional music video representations of black female rappers. Although it is not as visually explicit as videos released by Kim or Minaj, it portrays Banks in a sexualized manner, featuring shots down her shirt and lingering in slow motion on her wet clothing as she gets out of a pool. The camera situates the male gaze unambiguously. This sort of portrayal was common in videos by male and female rappers alike throughout the mid-1990s, 2000s, and thus far in the 2010s. At the same time, “L8R” also features certain distinctive musical and thematic elements that Banks would feature prominently in her later releases. Her rap, although devoid of the stylistic variety heard on her later songs such as “212,” features deft, dense lyrical qualities that came to define her characteristic delivery and flow as an MC. The lyrics, which celebrate Banks's sexuality and proclaim her desire to make money, stand out for their frank, explicit discussion of sex, particularly white attraction to black women. Her later releases would address these same themes. Despite receiving a modest amount of attention from YouTube users and music websites, however, “L8R” never gained enough traction or play to jumpstart her career. Pitchfork's Marc Hogan would later recall in retrospect that the song, while full of “no-holds-barred rhymes,” ultimately “lack[ed] a bit of the artist's later fire.”Footnote 34 In the end, “L8R,” while captivating in its own right, neither adequately differentiated Banks from other mainstream rappers such as Kim and Minaj nor offered the sort of sufficiently inventive and challenging rearticulation of black female identity she would later present in “212.” “212,” which Banks released in September 2011, developed the themes she introduced in “L8R” and combined them with a markedly different set of personas and musical elements. Released digitally in the United States on websites such as YouTube, Rhapsody, and SoundCloud, and on BBC 1 Radio in the UK, it became viral largely due to its accompanying music video, which was directed by Canadian directors Vincent Tsang and Paul Labonté and filmed in Montréal, where Banks was living at the time. Musically, “212” features Banks singing and rapping over a slight modification of Belgian electronic house producer Lazy Jay's song “Float Your Boat.” The song's underlying beat, composed of a sparse set of electronically modified drum machine and trumpet tracks, falls generally within the purview of European house music, which Banks has incorporated into multiple songs.Footnote 35 Banks's instrumental modifications of the original Lazy Jay song, which follows an AA’BCA’C structure, are minimal; nonetheless, her version comes off as markedly different from the original due to her vocal additions, namely a deft syncopated rap in the A and A’ sections, a soulful melodic solo in the B section, and a shout-like chant chorus in the C section. Lyrically, Banks adheres to several standard hip-hop tropes and approaches in the song. First, she infuses it with bravado and declares her merit in joining the canon of successful rappers. She devotes the rest of the song to proclaiming dominance over a rival. Bold assertions of confidence and superiority are cornerstones of rap performance; they serve to establish a strong, independent voice, worthy of praise and, often, envy.Footnote 36 In this manner, Banks follows a well-trod path traveled by the majority of aspiring hip-hop artists, male and female alike. Banks backs up these declarations by demonstrating her significant technical skill and stylistic versatility as a rapper. In terms of rhythm, lyrical variation, innovation, and delivery, Banks's syncopated, rapid-fire rap is easily as complex as that of any of the most heralded rappers in the mainstream American music industry. In a manner similar to artists such as Eminem, Nas, and Busta Rhymes, she peppers her verses with internal rhymes, puns, and dense, agile lines. The song's lasting effect, however, goes beyond simple lyrical skill and a convincing exhibition of confidence and technique. Indeed, at the same time that Banks signifies her belonging in the canon of major rap figures, she uses the music, lyrics, and video of “212” to reinvent the image and figure of the mainstream female hip-hop artist and subtly rearticulate conceptions of black female identity in the sphere of American hip-hop. For the purposes of this essay, I define “rearticulation” along the same lines as Loren Kajikawa, who applies Michael Omi and Howard Winant's theory of racial formation to analyze white rapper Eminem's mainstream debut. Following Omi and Winant, Kajikawa characterizes the term as the repositioning of “political interests and identities, through a recombination of familiar ideas and values in hitherto unrecognized ways.”Footnote 37 Banks accomplishes this rearticulation first by confronting the listener and viewer with lyrics and images that assert her sexuality, while at the same time presenting herself as independent and empowered and avoiding the kind of objectification common in the music and videos of previous female rappers who had achieved mainstream success. Like Banks's previous work in songs such as “L8R,” “212” features extended sexually explicit lyrics. In and of itself, that would not be particularly new or noteworthy. However, Banks and directors Tsang and Labonté use certain key musical and visual aspects to reframe these conventional rap elements and present Banks as dominant and in control. Most significantly, at the end of the A and A’ sections, Banks refers to the song's nameless female rival as a “cunt” and likens the woman's submission to oral sex:
• None A section: Now she wanna lick my plum in the evenin’ /
• None And fit that tongue, tongue d-deep in / For emphasis, as Banks repeats the final lines of each section, the music video flashes them repeatedly to the beat of an accented bass drum (see Figure 1). This jarring visual effect ensures that the viewer cannot ignore the lyrics, which up to this point in the song had avoided any references to sex, much less profanity on that level. Banks further emphasizes the switch in tone by flaring her eyes and licking her lips (see Figure 2)—powerful, almost predatory gestures of both sex and power. In addition to establishing Banks as dominant, these expressions assert her subjectivity and allow her to directly address the gaze of the viewer. The effect is especially abrupt given the previous content of the video, in which Banks eschewed aggressive posturing in favor of a series of coy, cheerful expressions. Banks's relationship with the other performers in the music video further establishes her in a position of power and allows her to confront the viewer's gaze. “212” features two men in supporting roles, played by Montréal-based producers Jacques Green, who is white, and Lunice, who is of mixed Haitian and Filipino descent. During most of his time onscreen, Lunice dances in a cheerful, gawky, often subtly effeminate manner while Banks follows just behind (see Figure 3). Lunice, who originally rose to prominence b-boying, adopts a markedly less stereotypically masculine manner of dancing and self-presentation than in his other performances and music videos.Footnote 38 Lunice appears oblivious of Banks's presence, while Banks, on the other hand, gazes purposefully at both him and the screen. The end of the video reinforces this dynamic: Lunice, who had previously remained oblivious of Banks's presence, sees her for the first time and appears timid (see Figure 4). That allows Banks, rather than the man, to act as the alpha. This altered dynamic also falls far outside the conventional gender roles portrayed by mainstream hip-hop artists. Over the past two decades, rap music videos featuring female and male stars alike have consistently presented men, especially male rappers, as powerful and in possession of the dominant gaze. These figures often surround themselves with subservient, hypersexualized women (often referred to as “video vixens” or “video hoes”) who often conform to strip club aesthetics.Footnote 39 Conversely, in her dance duet with Lunice, Banks presents herself in a strong, independent role, while Lunice, dancing to Banks's music, affects a subversive performance of masculinity that runs directly against the prevailing grain in hip-hop, as well as a variety of other Afro-diasporic music, such as soca and dancehall. Furthermore, by allowing Banks to look directly at the camera and intimidate the featured male character (who, conversely, never addresses the camera and acts submissive upon seeing Banks), the video reverses the typical dynamics of the male gaze present in most mainstream rap videos. Banks's provocative and unavoidable incorporation of the term “cunt” particularly stands out, even in a rap sphere that regularly incorporates sexually explicit profanity. Although other female rappers who have achieved mainstream success over the past two decades have occasionally incorporated the word into their lyrics, they generally use it as a derogatory term for other women, not as an alternative word for female genitalia.Footnote 40 Banks uses the word in both contexts and has referred to herself and her fans as “cunts” as well. Furthermore, women rappers’ videos have not highlighted the word itself in such a frequent and forceful manner as in the “212” video. Male rappers, when they incorporate the term, usually use it to disparage women or in the context of valorizing sexual violence.Footnote 41 Banks, on the other hand, employs the term to validate the black female body, challenge heteronormative norms in hip-hop, and establish herself as a figure of power. In addition to allowing her to appropriate a sexual gesture that rappers often use to express power over a romantic interest, Banks's prominent and provocative use of the word “cunt” reclaims a term men commonly use to disparage women and rearticulates it as a figure of strength and control.Footnote 42 Her use of the word in the context of describing oral sex with another woman is also significant; Banks herself has claimed to be bisexual in a number of interviews.Footnote 43 Although lesbian rappers such as Siya have discussed their sexuality in their music, descriptions of same-sex relations are rare in the mainstream hip-hop sphere, even today.Footnote 44 Banks's willingness to discuss and validate sex with another woman thus distinguishes her from most mainstream female rappers and challenges prevailing heteronormative standards in hip-hop. Taken together, Banks's use of “cunt” permits her to reassert her sexuality on her own terms. To be sure, Banks's use of the term to denigrate a female rival raises potential charges of hypocrisy; despite this possibility, she has characterized the word as empowering: “To be cunty is to be feminine and to be . . . aware of yourself. Nobody's fucking with that inner strength and delicateness.”Footnote 45 Banks is not alone in reframing the word “cunt” as positive. Many feminist authors and publications have endorsed this project, including, most notably, The Vagina Monologues, whose second scene, entitled “Reclaiming Cunt,” exhorts women to celebrate the word and view it in a favorable light. In the context of hip-hop, Banks's reclamation of “cunt” parallels the change in connotations associated with the word “bitch” over the past two decades. Citing Patricia Hill Collins's Black Sexual Politics, Stephanie Dunn notes that the term “bitch” has been revised as “Bitch” in order to signify a “hardcore woman who makes money and proudly flaunts her sexual libido . . . ‘bitch’ links the historical constructions of black female sexual wildness, whereas ‘Bitch’ suggests a woman who controls her own sexuality, manipulating it to her advantage.”Footnote 46 Banks herself has occasionally respelled “cunt” as “kunt” on Twitter, and one of her fan pages even labels itself the “Kunt Brigade.” Her use of the term ultimately allows her to reframe it as a marker of independent, empowered female identity. Directors Tsang and Labonté contrast Banks's confrontational lyrics and demonstrations of power by subverting the traditional image of the mainstream female hip-hop artist. As Andreana Clay observes, contemporary popular music generally only allows black women to express their sexuality through “narrow constructions informed by a heterosexual (often white) male gaze.”Footnote 47 Conversely, unlike the vast majority of previous female rappers who featured explicit lyrics, Banks does not present herself in an overtly sexualized manner. Indeed, rather than objectifying Banks, the “212” video creates a space to reverse the male gaze. It does so first by featuring extended close-ups on Banks's mouth as she delivers her lines (see Figure 5), thus eliminating her body from the frame entirely, denying the viewer the ability to see most of the parts of the female body that rap videos normally highlight and sexualize. Furthermore, Banks's choice of attire—a vintage Mickey Mouse sweater, faded torn jean shorts, and a Pippi Longstocking–style four-braid pigtail weave—eschews pointed emphasis on her body in favor of a tomboyish, youthful aesthetic that fits well within the stereotype of the 2011-era hipster. To be sure, Banks's appearance is not entirely devoid of sexual references. Although her attire is common among certain contemporary youth cultures, it also evokes stylistic choices that many may associate with pre-adolescence. Taken together with her explicit lyrics, this image lends a striking, even shocking undertone to her performance. The camera's focus on Banks's mouth when she licks her lips lends a further overtone of sensuality to a video otherwise lacking in overtly sexualized visual elements. In the end, her performance forwards a new visual and rhetorical understanding of black female identity and sexuality—one that allows her to discuss sex in a frank, open, and queered manner while mostly escaping the kind of objectification so common in the realm of mainstream female hip-hop.",0

Her big ass head prolly sweating under that ugly ass wig #standojacat","In addition to rearticulating mainstream conceptions of black female identity in hip-hop, Banks also confronts the white gaze by commenting on and critiquing white consumption of and attraction to black female artists and black cultural forms. Jacques Green, who provides the only white face in the “212” video, plays a critical role in this endeavor. During his time onscreen, Green stares at the camera with a slight smile, subtly nodding his head to the beat while Banks, facing him on the right side of the screen, raps and dances. In the beginning of the video, Banks holds a neutral pose and expression toward Green, but later on, in the A’ section, Banks's actions become increasingly provocative: smiling, she dances seductively up and down his left side (see Figure 6), ending with the line “Bet you do want to fuck.” In the next shot, she raps close to Green's face, ultimately lunging at his ear (see Figure 7) on the last word of the following lines: Wonder who let you come to 1 2 / The final shot with the two ends with Banks moving back and forth in a restrained, yet recognizable approximation of intercourse. At the end of this section, she leans in towards Green on the line, “I’m a ruin you, cunt,” which then immediately flashes on the screen. This sequence of shots allows Banks to address the white gaze and simulate and comment on the enjoyment of performers like her. Green seems oblivious to Banks's presence; instead, he acts out the physical motions of listening to and enjoying music on earphones. Banks, meanwhile, simulates what he's listening to—and, perhaps, imagining. Banks faces Green, interacting with him in a purposeful, forward manner, while Green fails to notice her. As in Banks's dance with Lunice, this setup upends the traditional visual model of music videos, in which performers stay on screen while viewers get to enjoy the resulting spectacle in private, hidden from view. As the video presents it, rather than performing and having a safely anonymous listener or viewer consume her music, in these sections of the “212” video, the listener is oblivious, while Banks—the performer—knows exactly what's going on. That a white male, particularly one dressed like Green (round glasses, plain white t-shirt), plays the part of the listener in the “212” video is particularly noteworthy. White men rarely make such prominent appearances in rap videos, and when they do, they rarely appear in attire that, like Banks’s, evokes young, cosmopolitan adults. In many ways, Green stands in for the prototypical white hip-hop enthusiast—a character Banks, in turn, comments on in several significant ways. By synchronizing lines such as “Bet you do want to fuck” and “fuck are you into, huh?” with Banks's dance with Green, the music video transforms the lyrics’ original meaning—which in the abstract purportedly refer to Banks's nameless rival and her boyfriend—into a comment on white male attraction to both black female sexuality and cultural practices associated with the black community. This theme was not alien to Banks's work—indeed, she had addressed it in her previous releases, including songs such as “L8R.” In a marked departure from the narratives given by most mainstream female rappers, Banks openly discussed her relationships with white men—and their attraction to her—for years after her debut. She would address white attraction to black women in detail in the single she released immediately after “212,” “Liquorice,” which referred to “212” and suggested that the song had raised her popularity among white listeners. Banks likened herself to the eponymous candy, and, as in her earlier song, “L8R,” suggested that white men found her irresistible: These niggas be vanilla, the chips be legitimate / They just want the pumpernickel sis in the linens with ’em / So since you vanilla men spend / Can my hot fudge bitches get with your vanilla friends? / You know I’m lookin for these niggas if these niggas is rich / He got creme for ya colors and a blue eye too / Hi, wanna get your number to your 212 line / Maybe we can slumber, we can w-w-w-wine. After the song's release, Banks was explicit about her desire to address a subject rarely encountered in black American music: “I date lots of white guys. It's still seen as slightly taboo in African American culture, but I thought, ‘Let me put this in your face and tell it how it is.’”Footnote 48 As she noted in an interview with BBC News, “It is a taboo among black women to desire white men, and vice versa. But if you read websites or magazines that are geared towards African American women, we’re very curious about white men. And the world is becoming so mixed up now, it's happening a lot more.”Footnote 49 In this context, Banks not only addresses the white male gaze, but also reverses it. Furthermore, her frank discussion of white attraction to black women allows her to celebrate cross-cultural mixture and present herself as someone willing to cut against mainstream ideals and standards of the black community from which she hails, thereby validating increasingly hybrid conceptions of contemporary society. At the same time, Banks also reverses the commonly discussed trope of black men dating white women—an action widely perceived to stem from Eurocentric standards of beauty and negative black female stereotypes.Footnote 50 By positioning herself—and black women in general—as the object of white male desire, she portrays black female sexuality and the black female body as the ultimate symbols of beauty and sex appeal. In the years after “212,” Banks has continued to do so by featuring an all-black clothing aesthetic in both her music videos (“Liquorice,” “Van Vogue,” “Luxury,” “Chasing Time,” and others) and in the various covers of her first full-length album, Broke With Expensive Taste. In a broader sense, she constructs a positive black feminist aesthetic that answers Janell Hobson's call to “challenge dominant culture's discourse of the black body grotesque and articulate a black liberation discourse on the black body beautiful.”Footnote 51 These actions were not lost on members of the hip-hop community. In an interview with Banks on GGN, Snoop Dogg hailed her for championing ideals of dark-skinned African American beauty: “I want to send a shout-out to you for being a, you know, chocolate diva. See, my daughter's chocolate, right? And what I want to say is they’re always trying to push the chocolate, the black, to the back, right? But y’all ass step up front, let ‘em know that chocolate flavor's here. See, you just stand tall and deliver, do that thing, you know what I’m sayin’? Representing for the dark side, baby.”Footnote 52 At the same time that Banks discusses—and often celebrates—black female relationships with white men, however, she also comments on and critiques their fascination with black cultural forms. In this context, the set of lyrics Banks directs at Green, “Wonder who let you come to 12 / With your doo-doo crew, son,” takes on an additional, subtler meaning: Banks suggests that the character to whom she directs the lyrics is an outsider in the imagined space of “212.” It is surely not a coincidence that the song derives its title from the Manhattan area code and makes reference to Harlem (“I was in the 212 / On the uptown A”), the New York neighborhood most strongly associated with the city's black community, where Banks herself grew up. Thus, her subtle lyrical references combine with her mastery of the hip-hop idiom in order to legitimize Banks as an insider—of Harlem, of the black community, of rap—and the character of the listener as a foreigner, albeit one who holds a lascivious fascination for her, her craft, and her backyard. Banks's final piece with Green, which ends with her delivering the line “I’m a ruin you, cunt,” concludes the interaction with a simulation and declaration of dominance and power. It also reframes the song's nameless rival as the white character on screen. Once more, Banks, not the man, is aware and in control. Banks's use of different voices and personas in the song's separate sections plays an even more significant role in this critique. Over the course of the song, Banks adopts three markedly different voices and styles. She delivers her most traditionally structured raps in the A and A’ sections. In these sections, her quick, deft rap solo alternately plays against and synchronizes with the underlying “Float Your Boat” beat. Banks delivers these lines in a distinctly different accent than in her other releases. In the songs she recorded before and after “212,” she consistently employs the pronunciation, grammar, vocabulary, and slang of what linguists refer to as African American Vernacular English (AAVE).Footnote 53 Banks continues to employ grammar and vocabulary distinct to AAVE throughout “212.” At the same time, in the rap (A and A’) sections of “212,” she mostly avoids employing pronunciations associated with AAVE, choosing instead to use pronunciations not associated with vernacular dialects such as AAVE but instead hew to Standard American English (SAE).Footnote 54 Banks also adopts certain pronunciations associated with the California Vowel Shift.Footnote 55 These linguistic differences create deliberate inconsistencies between text and sound that carry significant connotative weight. As Lauren Mason Carris observes, although the concept of “‘accent’ is a social construct, it serves as an important racializing factor that significantly impacts” the lives of racialized individuals in the United States.Footnote 56 Despite the fact that various Euro-descendent populations in the United States employ a wide variety of variations on SAE, and many black Americans primarily use SAE, SAE is still often associated with whiteness and upward socioeconomic mobility, whereas vernacular dialects such as AAVE are devalued and seen as incorrect.Footnote 57 Elements of the California Vowel Shift especially index white American populations; as Penelope Eckert notes, exaggerated use of the shift is associated with the “California white Anglo dialect,” as well as the archetypal personas of Valley Girls, who act as “icons of privilege, materialism, and empty-headedness, but also national trend-setters and the embodiment of white California.”Footnote 58 Banks's decision to perform textual AAVE using an accent associated not only with whiteness, but stereotypical whiteness, thus allows her to ironically comment on white fascination with black culture by subtly caricaturing the very racial group she signifies. Banks does not maintain this posture throughout the song, however. In the song's B section, she adopts an entirely different delivery. Instead of rapping, she sings a melodic solo to the melody of the background synthesizer and changes the accent she used in the A and A’ sections by pronouncing her lyrics in a manner more similar to AAVE. She also draws from African American gospel and blues inflections by using a rich, raspy timbre and incorporating slides, bends, and moans on vocables (in this case, on the word “Ayo”). This style of delivery is commonly found throughout genres of popular music developed in black American communities such as classic soul and R&B.Footnote 59 Banks's decision to reincorporate musical and linguistic markers associated with African American populations enables her to vocally signify an authentic black American identity and maintain a distinct black female persona that the rest of her performance avoids. This subversive mixture of differently racialized aspects of the English language follows the hip-hop practice of what linguists have characterized as “semantic inversion” and rappers have referred to as “flippin the script.”Footnote 60 As Geneva Smitherman argues, it is part of a tradition of manipulating mainstream forms of the English language that black Americans have used for centuries as they “created a communication system that became linguistically unintelligible to the oppressor, even though it was his language.”Footnote 61 It is part of a broader set of strategies, both in “212” and in the broader sphere of hip-hop, in which rappers advance covert commentary and critiques that take the form of “hidden transcripts,” or “critique[s] of power spoken behind the back of the dominant.”Footnote 62 “212” does not present an entirely critical or unwelcoming tone towards whiteness, however. Indeed, while the song subtly confronts the white gaze and critiques white fascination with black cultural forms, it also advances a parallel “public transcript” of openness to whiteness and deracialization that white listeners may find appealing.Footnote 63 The song accomplishes this in several ways. First, at the same time that directors Tsang and Labonté comment on Green's character's presence, the figure also functions as an avatar for the white male viewer, who gets to imagine himself in Green's place and who may not play close attention to Banks's less direct commentary. This placement allows the white viewer to feel invited into the space the “212” music video evokes—a space, significantly, that lacks overtly racialized visual markers other than the actors themselves, who come from diverse racial backgrounds. Taken together, the music, clothing, characters, and title “212,” which refers to all of Manhattan, create a less openly racialized space than in videos by black hip-hop artists, who often emphasize symbols of black authenticity. Filmed in Montréal, the scenes presented in “212” could take place in any number of densely populated North American cities. Moreover, other than Banks's subtle references to Harlem (“on the uptown A”), her lyrics avoid explicit references to race. The instrumental background, whose sparse electronic beat departs markedly from much mainstream hip-hop, further avoids evoking styles explicitly coded as black in the American musical sphere.Footnote 64 Finally, Banks's attire, which adopts a style more appropriate for a stereotype of a party in Williamsburg, Brooklyn than a conventional rap music video, evokes an aesthetic more commonly associated with alternative (and often white) twenty-something culture than hip-hop stars such as Kim and Minaj. Not coincidentally, music and news publications found this image irresistible: UK newspaper The Telegraph declared that Banks had “set hipster hearts aflame,” The Fader called her “unbearably cute,” and New Musical Express proclaimed her the “coolest person” of 2011.Footnote 65 Banks's approach of conveying the impression of a deracialized persona to white listeners as a means of gaining white fans follows an approach used by black politicians in majority-white districts, who pursue a strategy of deracialization in order to secure white votes. This practice is part of a broader phenomenon in recent racial politics that demands that “blacks seeking access to white spaces should be mainstream, articulate, and clean-cut, black but not too black, friendly, upbeat, and accommodating.”Footnote 66 In the context of “212,” it ultimately amounts to what may have been a perverse—or ingenious—marketing strategy. It addresses a common dilemma aspiring rappers face: hip-hop's “ambiguity between its inherent secrecy as a hidden transcript, and the task of becoming public in order to reach a larger audience and express emotions to others.”Footnote 67 By both adopting and subtly subverting markers of whiteness, Banks is able to both gain followers among white listeners, who constitute a hugely profitable section of the market for hip-hop, while at the same time advancing a subtler critique of those same listeners’ practices. In so doing, Banks harnesses the power of the white gaze to her own ends, thus “flipping the script” on a force that has historically worked in the other direction.",0

Her big ass head prolly sweating under that ugly ass wig #standojacat","Hip-hop and the White Gaze in “Post-Racial” America Banks's decision to signify, at least on the surface, an open and welcoming attitude towards black-white relations, reflects a broader moment of optimism in American culture regarding racial progress. At the time of the song's release (2011), figures from a variety of backgrounds had heralded events such as the historic election of the United States’ first black president as evidence that the nation had reached a fundamental turning point in its long history of racism and discrimination. Scholars and journalists from a wide range of backgrounds began to speak of the United States as a “post-racial” society and pointed to Barack Obama as “the harbinger of a new dawn in race relations” whose election proved that “the bad old days of ‘real racism’ were in the distant past and that the nation had achieved remarkable progress with regard to race.”Footnote 68 A variety of rappers released songs in celebration of the moment, leading Travis L. Gosa to declare Obama “the first hip-hop president.”Footnote 69 Banks's celebratory tone towards black-white relationships and US society's increasingly hybrid (in her words, “mixed-up”) nature point to a further positive outlook regarding the country's increasingly diverse populace. Writing in 2008, Shanette M. Harris cautiously praised developments such as a greater emphasis on “pluralism, diversity, and multiculturalism” in certain sectors of American society as offering great potential for African Americans.Footnote 70 These optimistic attitudes were not destined to last. Few events punctured the myth of a “post-racial” United States more acutely than the killings of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, and Eric Garner, which generated a wave of protests and brutal police responses across the country. For many, their deaths, along with the less-publicized killings of countless other unarmed black men and women, acted as reminders that the United States’ legacy of white supremacy was nowhere near being overcome. George Yancy lamented that the country's “national discourse regarding Trayvon Martin and questions of race have failed to produce a critical and historically conscious discourse that sheds light on what it means to be black in an anti-black America,” and maintained that the white gaze continued to privilege whiteness and devalue blackness.Footnote 71 Hip-hop has acted as a primary site of opposition in American popular culture. In both their songs and public rhetoric, a wide variety of rappers expressed solidarity with protestors and condemned chronically unpunished police violence against black men and women. Writing in The Guardian in November 2014, Lanre Bakare argued that “at a time when some have questioned the state of black leadership after Ferguson, hip-hop artists have proved to be—on the whole—a reliable, informed and engaged alternative to traditional ‘community leaders.’”Footnote 72 Hip-hop even served as a site for the families of the deceased to express their reactions: Eric Garner's daughter and brother, for instance, released a rap song entitled “This Ends Today.” On 3 December 2014, in the wake of the grand jury decision that failed to indict the officer who killed Garner, Banks expressed worry for the safety of black men and declared on Twitter that the matter “hurts deep deep down.”Footnote 73 Not all figures in hip-hop chose to address these matters, however. Notably absent from the discussion was white Australian rapper Iggy Azalea (b. 1990), who in 2014 broke the record for longest-lasting number one on the Billboard Hot 100 by a female rapper with her hit single “Fancy.” Banks responded to this development with an entirely more public and confrontational tone than in releases such as “212.” On Twitter, Banks called Azalea out for her ongoing silence, proclaiming, “it's funny to see people Like Igloo Australia silent when these things happen. . . Black Culture is cool, but black issues sure aren't huh?”Footnote 74 Their dispute soon gained greater publicity in the wake of a December 2014 interview on New York City radio station Hot 97 between Banks and DJs Ebro Darden, Laura Stylez, and Peter Rosenberg.Footnote 75 In the interview, Banks accused Azalea of embodying white exploitation of black culture: “Here's the thing with Iggy Azalea. In this country, whenever it comes to our things, like black issues or black politics or black music, or whatever, there's always this undercurrent of, kind of like a ‘fuck you,’ there's always like a ‘fuck y’all niggas,’ like y’all don't really own shit, like you don't really have shit, you know what I’m saying?”Footnote 76 Declaring that Azalea's music was inferior to releases by black women rappers, Banks labeled Azalea's success, along with accolades received by other white rappers such as Macklemore, as undeserved and demeaning to black artists: “It's like a cultural smudging, is what I see. And when they give these Grammys out, all it says to white kids is ‘Oh, you’re great, you’re amazing, you can do whatever you put your mind to,’ and what it says to black kids is ‘you don't have shit, you don't own shit, not even the shit you created for yourself.’ And it makes me upset.”Footnote 77 Banks characterized Azealia's popularity as part of a broader phenomenon in the United States of white appropriation of black musical production, arguing, “they’re trying to erase us. Like, all of our, like, books and scriptures and everything, like everything we’re supposed to know about ourselves is like, gone.”Footnote 78 This was not the first time Banks had feuded publicly with Azalea (born Amethyst Amelia Kelly), whom Banks had earlier accused of stealing her stage name. In February 2012, Banks expressed displeasure on Twitter with Azalea's selection as the first female rapper for the cover of XXL magazine's annual “Freshman” issue and asked how the publication could “endorse a white woman who called herself a ‘runaway slave master’.”Footnote 79 In the statement, Banks made reference to Azalea's song “D.R.U.G.S.,” in which Azalea declared, “When it really starts / I’m a runaway slave master” and pantomimed cracking a whip in the accompanying music video. Banks has also drawn attention to Azalea's rap delivery, which departs from her native Australian accent and approximates the pronunciation of variants of AAVE common in the Southern United States—a performance Brittney Cooper declared “almost convincingly mimics the sonic register of a downhome Atlanta girl.”Footnote 80 Many have taken issue with this choice of vocal delivery. Arthur Chu likened Azalea's accent to “verbal blackface,” and Amy Zimmerman declared that her performance shared “some essential genetic code with the old-school American minstrel show.”Footnote 81 Cooper drew attention to the endemic disparity between black and white female performers in hip-hop, arguing that: Iggy profits from the cultural performativity and forms of survival that Black women have perfected, without having to encounter and deal with the social problem that is the Black female body, with its perceived excesses, unruliness, loudness and lewdness. If she existed in hip hop at a moment when Black women could still get play, where it would take more than one hand to count all the mainstream Black women rap artists, I would have no problem. Iggy would be one among the many. But in this moment, she represents a problem of co-optation.Footnote 82 With the exception of the “runaway slave master” lyric, for which she later apologized, Azalea has for the most part rejected claims of racism and appropriation. She responded to Banks's criticism on Twitter by declaring: There are many black artists succeeding in all genres. The reason you haven't is because of your piss poor attitude. Your inability to be responsible for your own mistakes, bullying others, the inability to be humble or have self-control. It's YOU! You created your own unfortunate situation by being a bigot and don't have the mental capacity to realize yet. Probably never will. Now! rant, Make it racial! make it political! Make it whatever but I guarantee it won't make you likable & THATS why ur crying on the radio.Footnote 83 This statement follows a rhetorical strategy Azalea has adopted throughout her career, in which she has consistently played down the advantages she received as a white woman and dismissed accusations of being insufficiently political. In a 2013 interview with Complex, she characterized charges of inauthenticity as “retarded,” proclaiming, “I don't think the voice makes me fake; it makes me an artist. Voice is my medium. I should have creative rein to do whatever the fuck I want with it.”Footnote 84 She declared that black individuals who take issue with her should “start a rap career and give it a go, too. I’m not taking anyone's spot, so make yourself a mixtape. Or maybe if you’re black, start singing like a country singer and be a white person. I don't know. Why is it such a big deal? This is the entertainment industry. It's not politics.” It would be easy to write off Azalea's statements as hopelessly naïve. But she is far from alone in these sentiments. They are part of the broader phenomenon of “color-blind” ideology, which masks or denies outright the effects of racism and the advantages of white privilege. In the post–civil rights era, despite the enduring persistence of race-based discrimination, it has become the dominant philosophy regarding race in the United States.Footnote 85 It endures in contemporary perceptions of a “post-racial” United States, where adherents argue that race, if not irrelevant, continues to be less and less of a hindrance to black safety and success than individual or cultural shortcomings. Color-blind ideology has even penetrated the hip-hop sphere: rapper T. I. responded to critics of his decision to produce Azalea rather than a black woman by lamenting, “I can't believe we’re at a place in America where we still see color.”Footnote 86 Banks and Azalea's dispute ultimately mirrors a broader contemporary debate on the legitimacy of post-racial politics, in which those who seek to reassert the persistence of racism are met with claims of decreased racial discrimination and the idea that, fundamentally, opportunity exists in relatively equal amounts for all Americans, regardless of color. Artists such as Banks offer promising potential templates for addressing these issues. Her performance in “212” advances a timely critique of systemic sexism, racism, and appropriation in the American popular music sphere and situates herself as a novel figure within hip-hop's rich history of black female rappers speaking truth to power. The more critical qualities of Banks's performance, however, are often lost on “color-blind” hip-hop fans and musicians such as Iggy Azalea, who may overlook the music's hidden transcript of resistance in favor of its public transcript of provocative sexuality and openness to whites. This gap in understanding in turn reflects an entrenched division within the realm of hip-hop, in which black artists who emphasize hip-hop's essentially political qualities have to contend with white artists and fans who more often view it as entertainment. Why bother to examine a musical tradition's critical elements if one primarily conceives of it as a source of titillation and amusement? Barring a concerted effort on the part of white fans and musicians to take black artists seriously on a political level, this phenomenon will surely persist. Black female cultural innovators remain stubbornly reduced to, in the words of Jessica Care Moore, “hip-hop cheerleaders,” cheering “from the sidelines of a stage [they] built.”Footnote 87 Indeed, although overt, explicit forms of white supremacy have largely faded from public discourse, they continue in subtler and more entrenched forms. And although one would be remiss to disregard meaningful gains in racial progress over the past several decades, as long as deeper, more structural dehumanization of black bodies and devaluing of black voices endure, these issues will continue unabated. Recent events should make it clear that there is still much to be done.",0

What most critics of hip hop fail to realize is that hip hop is just a microcosm of the larger society/world we are all a part of. Rap does have some demographics over represented due to region, culture, etc, but all of the “negative” attributes of hip hop exist elsewhere in society too so it’s not just isolated to rap music.
